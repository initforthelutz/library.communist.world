   Jan. 7, 1917. Meeting of tho Swiss Socialist Party Executive. Centrist leader R. Grimm unites with social-patriot leaders to postpone indefinitely the party congress (originally appointed for Feb. 11, 1917 to discuss the war issue). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Nobs, Platten, Naine and others protest and vote against. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Postponement rouses the greatest indignation among class-conscious workers.

   Jan. 9. 1917. Publication of majority and minority resolutions.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="SPLSP17.html#en114">114</A>]</FONT> Clear statement <I>against</I> fatherland defence <I>totally lacking</I> in majority draft (Affolter and Schmid were against this), but &#167;3 does contain this demand: "Party parliamentary deputies shall be under obligation to reject, stating their principled grounds, all war demands and credits." That should be especially noted!

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Jan. 23, 1917. The Zurich <I>Volksrecht</I> puts the case for a referendum<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="SPLSP17.html#en115">115</A>]</FONT>. Sharply, but quite correctly, it characterises the postponement as a victory of Gr&uuml;tlianism over socialism. 
<A NAME="p283b">
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Leaders infuriated by referendum proposal. <I>Grimm</I> in the <I>Berner Tagwacht</I>, <I>Jacques Schmid</I> (Olten) in the <I>Neue Freie Zeitung</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="SPLSP17.html#en116">116</A>]</FONT> <I>F.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   R. Grimm stands at the head of this unholy crusade, making a special effort to intimidate the "youth organisation" and promising to come out against it at the next party congress. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Hundreds and hundreds of workers in German and French Switzerland eagerly sign referendum papers. Naine wires 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 284</B></FONT><P>

M&uuml;nzenberg that one cantonal secretariat will, in all probability, support referendum. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Jan. 22, 1917. The <I>Berner Tagwacht</I> and <I>Volksrecht</I> carry a statement by National Council member Gustav M&uuml;ller. He presents the party a veritable ultimatum, stating on behalf of his group (he writes: "our group") that he will resign from the National Council because he <I>cannot accept</I> "the principle of rejecting war credits". 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Jan. 26, 1917. In his fourth <I>Volksrecht</I> article, Greulich presents the same<A NAME="p284"> ultimatum to the party, saying that he will "naturally" resign if the party congress approves <I>paragraph 3 of the majority resolution.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="SPLSP17.html#en118">118</A>]</FONT> 
<A NAME="p284a">
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Jan. 27, 1917. E. Nobs says in an editorial comment ("On the Referendum") that <I>under no circumstances</I> can he endorse the referendum motivation.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="SPLSP17.html#en119">119</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Platten is silent. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Jan. 31, 1917. The Secretariat decides to convene the party congress on June 2 and 3, 1917 (it will be remembered that the Secretariat had earlier decided to convene it on Feb. 11, 1917, but the decision was repealed by the Party Executive!). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Feb. 1, 1917. Part of the Zimmerwald Conference meets at Olten, attended by representatives of organisations invited to the conference of Entente socialists (March 1917). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Radek, Zinoviev, M&uuml;nzenberg, one member of the <I>Internationale</I> (the Spartacus group in Germany, of which Karl Liebknecht was a member) publicly castigate R. Grimm, stating that his alliance with the social-patriots <I>against</I> the Swiss socialist workers makes him a "political corpse". 
<A NAME="p284b">
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Press is silent about this conference. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Feb. 1, 1917. Platten publishes his first article on the war issue.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="SPLSP17.html#en120">120</A>]</FONT> Attention should be drawn to the following two of his statements. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   First, Platten writes, literally: "Of course, the absence was felt in the commission of the cool-headed, courageous and consistent Zimmerwald champion who would have insisted on <I>pigeon-holing</I> the war issue till the end of the war." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   No name was mentioned, but it should not be hard to guess against whom this blow was aimed. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Second, Platten makes this statement of principle: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "The war issue is not only a battle of opinions around <I>this</I> question, but is indicative also of a definite trend in 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 285</B></FONT><P>

the further development of the party; it is a struggle against opportunism within the party, and an act of opposition to the reformists and in favour of revolutionary class struggle." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Feb. 3, 1917. A private meeting of Centrists (Grimm, Schneider, Rimathe and others) attended also by Nobs and Platten. M&uuml;nzenberg and Dr. Bronski are invited but decline. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   A decision is adopted to "amend" the majority resolution in a way that materially <I>worsens</I> it and turns it into a "Centrist resolution", especially because <I>paragraph 3</I> is deleted and replaced by a deliberate]y indefinite and hazy expression. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Feb. 6, 1917. General meeting of Social-Democratic Party members in Zurich. Main item: committee elections. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Poor attendance, especially on the part or workers. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Platten suggests postponing the meeting. Social-patriots and Nobs object. Proposal is defeated. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Elections are held. When it turns out that Dr. Bronski is elected, social-patriot <I>Baumann</I> announces on behalf of four committee members that he refuses to work with Dr. Bronski. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Platten suggests accepting this ultimatum (submitting to it), proposing (absolutely undemocratically and unlawfully) that the elections be declared invalid. That proposal is carried!!! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Feb. 9, 1917. Publication of a "new" majority resolution. The signatures: the "Centrists" Grimm, Rimathe, Schneider, Jacques Schmid,<A NAME="p285"> etc., also Nobs and Platten. The resolution has been greatly worsened and <I>paragraph 3</I>, as indicated above, deleted.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="SPLSP17.html#en121">121</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The resolution does <I>not even hint</I> at combating opportunism and reformism, or at a firm decision to follow Karl Liebknecht's tactics! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is a typical Centrist resolution, in which "general", supposedly "theoretical" disquisitions predominate, while practical demands are deliberately couched in such feeble and hazy language that, it can be hoped, not only Greulich and G. M&uuml;ller, but even Baumann -- Zurich will probably deign to withdraw their ultimatum and . . . amnesty the party. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To sum up: the leaders of the Swiss party have solemnly buried Zimmerwaldism in the "marsh". 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 286</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Addition: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The St. Gallen <I>Volksstimme</I> of Jan. 25, 1917 (to which <I>Huber</I> -- Rorschach frequently contributes): 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "It suffices to oppose to this shamelessness [i.e., the referendum motivation] the fact that the postponement proposal (Jan. 7) was made by Comrade Grimm and energetically supported, among others, by Comrades <I>Manz</I>, <I>Greulich</I>, <I>M&uuml;ller</I>, <I>Affolter</I> and <I>Schmid</I>." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The <I>Basler Vorw&auml;rts</I> of Jan. 16, 1917 reports that the postponement proposal (Jan. 7) was tabled by the following comrades: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Grimm, Rimathe, Studer, M&uuml;nch, Lang -- Zurich, Schneider -- Basel, Keel -- St. Gallen and Schnurrenberger (!!? obviously a misprint for Schneeberger?). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The workers have every reason to be grateful to the two papers for listing these <I>names </I>! . . .

   Lenin here refers to the referendum on the convocation of an emergency congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party to discuss its attitude towards the war. The referendum was initiated by the Left forces following the party Executive's decision to postpone the congress indefinitely. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   On January 23, 1917, <I>Volksrecht</I> (No. 19) published in the "Party Life" column an appeal of the initiating group under the heading "Das Referendum gegen den Parteivorstandbeschluss ergriffen") ("Referendum Against Executive's Decision Begins").
