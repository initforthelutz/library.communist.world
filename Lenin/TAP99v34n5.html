<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I have received your letter of December 24. I am very glad that you have at last got rid of your illness, of which rumours had even reached us. I heard of it during the holidays while I was in Minusinsk, and kept thinking where and how I could obtain news of you. (I thought it inconvenient to write to you directly, as you were said to be<A NAME="p28"> seriously ill.) Well, you have now revived just in time for a literary undertaking which is also being revived. Of course, you know already about <I>Nachalo</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP99v34n5.html#en25">25</A>]</FONT> which is to be started in the middle of February. I hope you have now fully recovered -- it is already a month since you wrote the last letter -- and that you will be able to work. You are probably fairly well provided for in the matter of books and order the chief new ones? If you are not too short of funds for ordering books, I think you can work even in the backwoods -- at least I judge by myself, comparing my life in Samara seven years ago, when I was reading almost exclusively other people's books, and now, when I have begun to acquire the habit of ordering books. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In regard to the <I>Heritage</I> I have had to agree with your opinion that to consider it as something of an integral nature is a bad tradition of the bad years (the eighties).<A NAME="p28a"> Perhaps I really ought not to tackle historico-literary themes. . . . My justification is that nowhere do I propose acceptance of Skaldin's heritage.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP99v34n5.html#en26">26</A>]</FONT> That one must take over the heritage from other<A NAME="p28b"> people is indisputable. It seems to me that my defence (from possible attacks of opponents) will be the note on p. 237, where it was precisely Chernyshevsky<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP99v34n5.html#en27">27</A>]</FONT> I had in mind and where I gave reasons why it was inconvenient to take him as a parallel.* It is admitted there that Skaldin is a <I>Liberalkonservativ</I>, that he is "not typical"

of the sixties, that it is "inconvenient" to take "typical" writers; I did not have Chernyshevsky's articles and do not have them, moreover the chief ones have still not been republished, and I should hardly be able to avoid snags here. Furthermore, I would begin defending myself by pointing to the fact that I gave an exact definition of what I understand by the "heritage" of which I am speaking. Of course, if the article nevertheless gives the impression that the author proposes to accept precisely Skaldin's heritage, this is a fault that cannot be remedied. I forgot what is perhaps my chief "defence", namely, that if Skaldin is a "rarity", then bourgeois liberalism, more or less consistent and free from Narodism, is by no means a rarity, but a very broad trend of the sixties and seventies. You retort: "Coincidence and continuity are poles apart". But the crux of the matter is that the article says it is necessary to purge bourgeois liberalism of Narodism. If this is true and <I>if it is feasible</I> (a particularly important condition!), then the result of the purge, the residue after it, will be bourgeois liberalism that not only coincides with Skaldin's but is its successor. Thus, if I am accused of accepting Skaldin's heritage, I shall be entitled to answer that I am merely undertaking to <I>purge</I> it of admixtures, but that I myself have nothing to do with it and, in addition to cleaning various Augean stables, have more congenial and more positive occupations. . . . Well, I'm afraid I have let myself be carried away and really imagine myself a "defendant"! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We have not corresponded for such a long time that to tell you the truth I have forgotten when I last wrote you about the articles "<I>Die historische Berechtigung </I>". I believe I wrote before I received them?* Now I have read them and have found that the author's main idea is fully acceptable (especially at the end concerning the two extremes or snags that have to be avoided). In giving the reasons, however, one should really bring out more sharply the <I>Klassencharakter</I> of the <I>Bewegung </I>** of which the author speaks (he mentioned it, but only in passing and very briefly), and furthermore not to regard the Fronde-like

It is worth while recalling their attitudes towards seasonal work, migration, etc. The author should have formulated the task more accurately: to free all <I>fortschrittliche Str&ouml;mungen   </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP99v34n5.html#fnp30">**</A>]</FONT> from the rubbish of Narodism and agrarianism and to utilise all of them in this purified form. In my opinion, "utilise" is a much more exact and suitable word than <I>Unterst&uuml;tzung und Bundesgenossenschaft.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP99v34n5.html#fnp30">***</A>]</FONT> The latter indicates the equality of these <I>Bundesgenossen</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP99v34n5.html#fnp30">****</A>]</FONT> yet they must (in this I fully agree with you) follow in the wake, sometimes even "with clenched teeth"; they have absolutely not grown so far as to reach equality and will never grow to reach it, owing to their cowardice, disunity, etc. <I>Unterst&uuml;tzung</I>, however, will come by no means from the <I>Intelligenz und fortschrittliche Grundbesitzer </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[5]</FONT> alone, but also from many others, both from Semites and from <I>fortschrittliche Kaufleute und Industrielle </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[6]</FONT> (the author has quite wrongly passed them over: it is still a question whether they constitute a smaller percentage in their milieu than in that of the <I>Grundbesitzer </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[7]</FONT>) and those <I>Bauern </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[8]</FONT> who tend to represent <I>Urteil</I> and not <I>Torurteil</I>, <I>Kukunft</I> and not <I>Vergangenheit </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[9]</FONT> of their class, and very many others. In two respects the author has tipped the scales in the other direction: firstly, in combating the Economists he has left aside <I>praktische</I>, immediate <I>Forderungen</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[10]</FONT> which are important not only for <I>industriellen Arbeiter</I>, but also for <I>Hausindustrielle</I> and <I>Landarbeiter</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[11]</FONT> etc. Secondly, he has fought against an abstract,

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   As regards the heart of the matter, however, I think there are no differences of opinion with the author. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   About Parvus, I haven't the slightest notion of his personal cHaracter and do not at all deny his great talent. Unfortunately, I have read very few of his works.

   Do you expect to obtain Kautsky's <I>Die Agrarfrage</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>****</FONT> which has recently come out? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Regarding Wert, Yevg, Solovyov and M. Filippov, I must say that the first-named I do not know at all, and I have read very little of the other two. That there is and will be "weathering", I have not an iota of doubt. Hence it is especially necessary to have not only <I>verkleidete Literatur.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>*****</FONT>
