</FONT></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Comrades, the workers' and peasants' revolution, about the necessity of which the Bolsheviks have always spoken, has been accomplished. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What is the significance of this workers' and peasants' revolution? Its significance is, first of all, that we shall have a Soviet government, our own organ of power, in which the bourgeoisie will have no share whatsoever. The oppressed masses will themselves create a power. The old state apparatus will be shattered to its foundations and a new administrative apparatus set up in the form of the Soviet organisations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From now on, a new phase in the history of Russia begins, and this, the third Russian revolution, should in the end lead to the victory of socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One of our urgent tasks is to put an immediate end to the war. It is clear to everybody that in order to end this war, which is closely bound up with the present capitalist system, capital itself must be fought. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We shall be helped in this by the world working-class movement, which is already beginning to develop in Italy, Britain and Germany. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The proposal we make to international democracy for a just and immediate peace will everywhere awaken an ardent response among the international proletarian masses. 

<A NAME="p240">
<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 240</B></FONT><P>

All the secret treaties<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MPS17.html#en98">98</A>]</FONT> must be immediately published in order to strengthen the confidence of the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Within Russia a huge section of the peasantry have said that they have played long enough with the capitalists, and will now march with the workers. A single decree putting an end to landed proprietorship will win us the confidence of the peasants. The peasants will understand that the salvation of the peasantry lies only in an alliance with the workers. We shall institute genuine workers' control over production. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have now learned to make a concerted effort. The revolution that has just been accomplished is evidence of this. We possess the strength of mass organisation, which will overcome everything and lead the proletariat to the world revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must now set about building a proletarian socialist state in Russia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Long live the world socialist revolution! (<I>Stormy applause.</I>)

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies hails the victorious revolution of the proletariat and the garrison of Petrograd. The Soviet particularly emphasises the solidarity, organisation, discipline and complete unanimity displayed by the masses in this unusually bloodless and unusually successful uprising. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is the unshakable conviction of the Soviet that the workers' and peasants' government which will be created by the revolution, as a Soviet government, and which will ensure the urban proletariat the support of the whole mass of the poor peasantry, will firmly advance towards socialism, the only means of saving the country from the untold miseries and horrors of war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The new workers' and peasants' government will immediately propose a just and democratic peace to all belligerent nations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It will immediately abolish landed proprietorship and hand over the land to the peasants. It will institute workers' control over the production and distribution of goods and establish national control over the banks, at the same time transforming them into a single state enterprise. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies calls on all workers and all peasants to support the workers' and peasants' revolution devotedly and with all their energy. The Soviet expresses the conviction that the urban workers, in alliance with the poor peasants, will display strict, comradely discipline and establish the strictest revolutionary order, which is essential for the victory of socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Soviet is convinced that the proletariat of the West European countries will help us to achieve a complete and lasting victory for the cause of socialism.

   The meeting opened at 2.35 p.m. on October 25 (November 7), and heard a report of the Revolutionary Military Committee on the overthrow of the Provisional Government and the triumph of the revolution. Lenin gave a report on the tasks facing Soviet power. The resolution motioned by Lenin (see p. 241) was adopted by an overwhelming majority.

   The reference is to secret diplomatic documents, such as the secret treaties concluded by the tsarist and later by the bourgeois Provisional Government of Russia with the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other imperialist powers. From November 10 (23), 1917, these documents were published in <I>Pravda</I> and <I>Izvestia</I>, and in December were put out in a series entitled <I>Collection of Secret Documents from the Archives of the Former Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</I> Seven volumes were published from December 1917 to February 1918. By publishing the secret

treaties, the Soviet Government's revolutionary propaganda struck a great blow for a general democratic peace, without annexations and indemnities, and exposed the imperialist nature of the First World War.
