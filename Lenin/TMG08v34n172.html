<P>
Dear A. M.,

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I have received your letter concerning my fight with the Machists. I quite understand and respect your feelings and I ought to say that I get something similar from my St. Petersburg friends, but I am very deeply convinced that you are mistaken. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   You must understand -- and you will, of course -- that once a Party man has become convinced that a certain doctrine is grossly fallacious and <I>harmful</I>, he is obliged to come out against it. I would not be kicking up a row if I were not absolutely convinced (and I am becoming more and more convinced of this every day as I study the original sources of wisdom of Bazarov, Bogdanov and Co.) that their book is ridiculous, harmful, philistine, fideist -- the whole of it, from beginning to end, from branch to root, to Mach and Avenarius. Plekhanov, at bottom, is <I>entirely</I> right in being against them, only he is unable or unwilling or too lazy to say so <I>concretely</I>, in detail, simply, without unnecessarily frightening his readers with philosophical nuances. And at all costs I shall say it <I>in my own way.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What kind of "reconciliation" can there be here, dear A. M.? Why, it is ludicrous even to mention it. A fight is <I>absolutely</I> inevitable. And Party people should devote their efforts not to slurring it over, putting it off or dodging it, but to ensuring that essential Party work <I>does not suffer</I> in practice. That is what you should be concerned about, and nine-tenths of the Bolsheviks in Russia will help you in this and heartily thank you for it. 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 389</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  How is this to be done? By "neutrality"? No. There cannot and <I>will not</I> be any neutrality on such an issue. If it is possible to speak of neutrality, it can only be in a <I>relative</I> sense: we must <I>separate</I> all this fight from the faction. So far, you have been writing "from the outside", keeping away from the factional publications; go on writing in this way. Only so will the faction not be committed, not be <I>involved</I>, not be compelled tomorrow or the day after to <I>decide</I>, to <I>vote</I>, i.e., to turn the <I>fight</I> into a chronic, protracted, hopeless affair.<A NAME="p389"> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   That is why I am <I>against</I> allowing any kind of philosophy in the journal.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TMG08v34n172.html#en375">375</A>]</FONT> I know I am being abused for this: he wants to stop other people's mouths, while he has not yet opened his own! But just think it over coolly. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   A journal with philosophy. No. 1 -- three articles of Bazarov, Bogdanov and Lunacharsky against Plekhanov. One article of mine saying that <I>Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism</I> = Berdayevism and reactionary clericalism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   No. 2 -- three times three keyed up articles of Bogdanov, Bazarov and Lunacharsky against Plekhanov and Lenin. One article of mine, proving from another angle that <I>Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism</I> = reactionary clericalism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   No. 3 -- howling and cursing. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I could write six or a dozen articles against <I>Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism</I>, one article against each author and each aspect of his views. Can this drag on in this way? How long? Will <I>this</I> not make a split <I>inevitable</I> through endless exacerbation and embitterment? Will <I>this</I> not bind the faction to make a decision: decide, analyse, and end the "discussion" by a vote. . . . 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Think this over carefully, if you fear a split. Will the practical workers undertake to distribute books with such a "fight"? Isn't another way better: go on writing as before, <I>outside</I> the factional publications. Do your scrapping on the side, <I>for the time being</I> the faction can wait. If there is a chance of <I>weakening</I> the inevitable animosity, it can only be in this way, I think. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   You write: the Mensheviks will gain from a fight. You are mistaken, deeply mistaken, A. M.! They will gain if the Bolshevik faction does not dissociate itself from the philosophy of the three Bolsheviks. <I>In that case</I>, they will 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 390</B></FONT><P>

definitely win. But if the philosophical fight goes on outside the faction, the Mensheviks will be definitely reduced to a political line and that will be the death of them."

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I say: <I>separate</I> the fight from the faction. Of course, such a separation, on living persons, is rather difficult and painful. It needs time. It needs solicitous comrades. Here the practical workers will help, here you should help, here it is a question of "psychology", and you know best. I think you could help a lot here -- provided that, on reading my book against the <I>Studies</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TMG08v34n172.html#fnp390">*</A>]</FONT> you don't become as furious against me as I became against them. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  As regards the journal, think it over carefully and answer me soon. I am a little doubtful whether it is worth while for us to make the journey to you together <I>at present.</I> Why jangle nerves unnecessarily? Why draw out the torture . . . there is no avoiding a fight. Would it not be better to settle this business of the journal simply, without long negotiations and ceremonial and futile meetings. I am merely putting questions to you in order to consult you. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Best regards to M. F. I shall most certainly come to Capri and try to bring my wife along, only I should like to do this independently of the philosophical fight.

<P ALIGN=right>
All the very best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
                                 Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

   P.S. I enclose <I>important</I> information about a spy among you.
