                               A GOOD RESOLUTION AND A BAD SPEECH<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  All class-conscious workers in Russia undoubtedly showed interest in the resolution on Russian affairs passed by the International Bureau and paid attention to it. It is known that the pivot of this resolution was the decision to organise or arrange a "<I>general exchange of opinion </I>" among "all sections of the working-class movement" of Russia, including those which accept the Social-Democratic programme, as well as those whose programmes "are in agreement" (or "in harmony " -- <I>im Einklange </I>) with it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The latter definition is extremely broad, for it embraces not only the supporters of Jagiello, but also every group that wishes to declare that its programme "harmonises" or "is in agreement with" the Social-Democratic programme. This broad definition, however, will not do any harm for, of course, it is desirable that the widest possible circle should participate in this "<I>exchange of opinion </I>" so as not to exclude any of those with whom even individual groups of Social-Democrats <I>might desire</I> to unite. We must not forget that two plans were proposed at the meeting of the International Socialist Bureau: (1) Kautsky's plan to "arrange a general exchange of opinion" and <I>no more.</I> An exchange of opinion before impartial colleagues, the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau, will <I>ascertain</I> the state of affairs and the depth of the disagreements; (2) The plan proposed by Rosa Luxemburg, but withdrawn after Kautsky's objections. This plan proposed a "unification conference" (<I>Einigungskonferenz </I>) "to restore the united party". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This second plan was not so good, of course, for, the first essential is to gather precise data, apart from the fact that Rosa Luxemburg was merely trying to smuggle in "restoration" of the notorious "Tyszka group". 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 529</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The plan accepted was Kautsky's; it was more cautious and approached the question of unity more systematically, <I>through</I> a preliminary "exchange of opinion" and the study of precise data. It is quite natural therefore that Kautsky's resolution should have been adopted unanimously. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But a distinction must be drawn between Kautsky's resolution, which was adopted by the Bureau, and the <I>speech</I> he made, in the course of which he said some <I>monstrous things</I> on one point. We have already commented briefly on this matter,<A NAME="p529"> but the appearance, of the report of Kautsky's speech in <I>Vorw&auml;rts</I> (the chief organ of the German party)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="GRBS13.html#en148">148</A>]</FONT> compels us to deal with this important question in greater detail. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Objecting to Rosa Luxemburg, Kautsky said that "the old party had disappeared although old names had been retained which, however, in the course of time (<I>im Laufe der Jahre</I> -- during the past few years) had acquired a new content. Old comrades could not simply be excluded merely because their party (<I>ihre Partei </I>) did not bear the old name". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When Rosa Luxemburg objected to this and said that "Kautsky's statement that the Russian party was dead [<I>sei tot </I>] was a thoughtless expression", Kautsky limited himself to "protesting that he did not say that Russian Social-Democracy was dead. He merely said that the old forms were broken, and that a new form would have to be created". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is the translation of the official record of the passages relevant to our question. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is obvious that Kautsky did not say and could not have said that <I>Social-Democracy</I> was dead. But he did say that the <I>party</I> had disappeared, and this <I>he did not withdraw</I>, in spite of the protest that was made! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is incredible, but it is a fact. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The confusion Kautsky betrayed here is stupendous. To the exclusion of <I>which</I> "old comrades" did he refer? Potresov and Co.? By "<I>their</I> party" did he mean liquidator amorphousness? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Or did Kautsky have in mind the "P.S.P. Left wing" which was excluded by Rosa Luxemburg's formula? If so, then his expression "old comrades" is unintelligible, for <I>never</I> since the Social-Democratic Party has been in existence, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 530</B></FONT><P>

i.e., since 1898, have the members of the P.S.P. and Social-Democrats been fellow party members. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As far as we are concerned the two interpretations are the same, for it would be ridiculous indeed to exclude the liquidators from an "exchange of opinion" on the question of unity (for the whole question centres round them), just as it would be ridiculous to exclude the P.S.P. Left wing (speaking abstractly, the liquidators -- anything can be expected of them -- are quite capable of making an ultimatum of their defence of their break-away alliance with the <I>non</I>-Social-Democratic P.S.P.). At all events it must be ascertained exactly not only what the liquidators want of the party, but also what their allies want.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The undoubted fact remains that at the Bureau, Kautsky went to the length of saying that the Russian party had disappeared.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   How could he have descended to such a monstrous state ment? To understand this the Russian workers must know <I>who informs</I> the German Social-Democratic press about Russian affairs? When the Germans write they usually avoid the question of our disagreements. When Russians write for German Social-Democratic publications we either see all the &eacute;migr&eacute; coteries allied with the liquidators in a campaign of scurrilous abuse against the "Leninists" (as was the case in <I>Vorw&auml;rts</I> in the spring of 1912), or the writings of the Tyszkas and Trotskys, or a member of some other &eacute;migr&eacute; coterie, deliberately obscuring the issue. <I>For years</I> there has not been a single document, collection of resolutions, analysis of ideas, or a single attempt to collect the facts! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We regret that the German leaders (who show ability in collecting and analysing facts when they study theory) are not ashamed to listen to and repeat the fairy-tales of their liquidator informants.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Bureau's <I>resolution</I> will be carried out, but Kautsky's speech will remain a sad curiosity.
