To Comrade Sylvia Pankhurst, London

<P ALIGN=right>August 28, 1919&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
Dear Comrade,

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  I received your letter of July 16, 1919, only yesterday. I am extremely grateful to you for the information about Britain and will try to fulfil your request, i.e., reply to your question. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I have no doubt at all that many workers who are among the best, most honest and sincerely revolutionary members of the proletariat are enemies of parliamentarism and of any participation in Parliament. The older capitalist culture and bourgeois democracy in any country, the more understandable this is, since the bourgeoisie in old parliamentary countries has excellently mastered the art of hypocrisy and of fooling the people in a thousand ways, passing off bourgeois parliamentarism as "democracy in general" or as "pure democracy" and so on, cunningly concealing the million threads which bind Parliament to the stock exchange and the capitalists, utilising a venal mercenary press and exercising the power of money, the power of capital in every way. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  There is no doubt that the Communist International and the Communist Parties of the various countries would be making an irreparable mistake if they repulsed those workers who stand for Soviet power, but who are against participation in the parliamentary struggle. If we take the problem in its general form, theoretically, then it is this very programme, i.e., the struggle for Soviet power, for the Soviet republic, which is able to unite, and today must certainly unite, all sincere, honest revolutionaries from among the workers. Very many anarchist workers are now becoming 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 562</B></FONT><P>

sincere supporters of Soviet power, and that being so, it proves them to be our best comrades and friends, the best of revolutionaries, who have been enemies of Marxism only through misunderstanding, or, more correctly, not through misunderstanding but because the official socialism prevailing in the epoch of the Second International (1889-1914) betrayed Marxism, lapsed into opportunism, perverted Marx's revolutionary teachings in general and his teachings on the lessons of the Paris Commune of 1871 in particular. I have written in detail about this in my book <I><A HREF="SR17.html">The State and Revolution</A></I> and will therefore not dwell further on the problem.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What if in a certain country those who are Communists by their convictions and their readiness to carry on revolutionary work, sincere partisans of Soviet power (the "Soviet system", as non-Russians sometimes call it), cannot unite owing to disagreement over participation in Parliament? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I should consider such disagreement immaterial at present, since the struggle for Soviet power is the political struggle of the proletariat in its highest, most class-conscious, most revolutionary form. It is better to be with the revolutionary workers when they are mistaken over some partial or secondary question than with the "official" socialists or Social-Democrats, if the latter are not sincere, firm revolutionaries, and are unwilling or unable to conduct revolutionary work among the working masses, but pursue correct tactics in regard to that partial question. And the question of parliamentarism is now a partial, secondary question. Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were, in my opinion, correct when they defended participation in the elections to the German bourgeois parliament,<A NAME="p562"> to the constituent National Assembly, at the January 1919 Conference of the Spartacists in Berlin, <I>against</I> the majority at the Conference.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LSP19.html#en92">92</A>]</FONT> But, of course, they were still more correct when they preferred remaining with the Communist Party, which was making a partial mistake, to siding with the direct traitors to socialism, like Scheidemann and his party, or with those servile souls, doctrinaires, cowards, spineless accomplices of the bourgeoisie, and reformists in practice, such as Kautsky, Haase, D&auml;umig and all this "party" of German "Independents". 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 563</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  I am personally convinced that to renounce participation in the parliamentary elections is a mistake on the part of the revolutionary workers of Britain, but better to make that mistake than to delay the formation of a big workers' Communist Party in Britain out of all the trends and elements,<A NAME="p563"> listed by you, which sympathise with Bolshevism and sincerely support the Soviet Republic. If, for example, among the B.S.P.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LSP19.html#en93">93</A>]</FONT> there were sincere Bolsheviks who refused, because of differences over participation in Parliament, to merge at once in a Communist Party with trends 4, 6 and 7, then these Bolsheviks, in my opinion, would be making a mistake a thousand times greater than the mistaken refusal to participate in elections to the British bourgeois parliament. In saying this I naturally assume that trends 4, 6 and 7, taken together, are really connected with the <I>mass</I> of the workers, and are not <I>merely</I> small intellectual groups, as is often the case in Britain. In this respect particular importance probably attaches to the Workers Committees and Shop Stewards,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LSP19.html#fnp563">*</A>]</FONT> which, one should imagine, are closely connected with the <I>masses.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Unbreakable ties with the mass of the workers, the ability to agitate unceasingly among them, to participate in every strike, to respond to every demand of the masses -- this is the chief thing for a Communist Party, especially in such a country as Britain, where until now (as incidentally is the case in all imperialist countries) participation in the socialist movement, and the labour movement generally, has been confined chiefly to a thin top crust of workers, the labour aristocracy, most of whom are thoroughly and hopelessly spoiled by reformism and are held back by bourgeois and imperialist prejudices. Without a struggle against this stratum, without the destruction of every trace of its prestige among the workers, without convincing the masses of the utter bourgeois corruption of this stratum, there can be no question of a serious communist workers' movement. This applies to Britain, France, America and Germany. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Those working-class revolutionaries who make parliamentarism the centre of their attacks are quite right inasmuch as these attacks serve to express their denial in prin-

ciple of bourgeois parliamentarism and bourgeois democracy. Soviet power, the Soviet republic -- this is what the workers' revolution has put in place of bourgeois democracy, this is the form of transition from capitalism to socialism, the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. And criticism of parliamentarism is not only legitimate and necessary, as giving the case for the transition to Soviet power, but is quite correct, as being the recognition of the historically conditional and limited character of parliamentarism, its connection with capitalism and capitalism alone, of its progressive character as compared with the Middle Ages, and of <I>its reactionary character as compared with Soviet power.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But the critics of parliamentarism in Europe and America, when they are anarchists or anarcho-syndicalists, are very often wrong insofar as they reject <I>all participation</I> in elections and parliamentary activity. Here they simply show their lack of revolutionary experience. We Russians, who have lived through two great revolutions in the twentieth century, are well aware what importance parliamentarism can have, and actually does have during a revolutionary period in general and <I>in the very midst of a revolution</I> in particular. Bourgeois parliaments must be abolished and replaced by Soviet bodies. There is no doubt about that. There is no doubt now, after the experience of Russia, Hungary, Germany and other countries, that this <I>absolutely must take place</I> during a proletarian revolution. Therefore, systematically to prepare the working masses for this, to explain to them in advance the importance of Soviet power, to conduct propaganda and agitation for it -- all this is the <I>absolute</I> duty of the worker who wants to be a revolutionary in deeds. But we Russians fulfilled that <I>task</I>, operating in the parliamentary arena, <I>too.</I> In the tsarist, fake, landowners' Duma our representatives knew how to carry on revolutionary and republican propaganda. In just the same way <I>Soviet propaganda</I> can and must <I>be carried on</I> in and from within bourgeois parliaments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Perhaps that will not be easy to achieve at once in this or that parliamentary country. But that is another question. Steps must be taken to ensure that these correct tactics are mastered by the revolutionary workers in all countries. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 565</B></FONT><P>

And if the workers' party is really <I>revolutionary</I>, if it is really a <I>workers'</I> party (that is, connected with the masses, with the majority of the working people, with the <I>rank and file</I> of the proletariat and not merely with its top crust), if it is really a <I>party</I>, i.e., a firmly, effectively knit <I>organisation of the revolutionary vanguard</I>, which knows how to carry on revolutionary work among the masses by all possible means, then such a party will surely be able to keep its <I>own</I> parliamentarians in hand, to make of them real revolutionary propagandists, such as Karl Liebknecht was, and not opportunists, not those who corrupt the proletariat with bourgeois methods, bourgeois customs, bourgeois ideas or bourgeois poverty of ideas. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If that failed to be achieved in Britain at once, if, in addition, no union of the supporters of Soviet power proved possible in Britain because of a difference over parliamentarism and only because of that, then I should consider a good step forward to complete unity the immediate formation of <I>two</I> Communist Parties, i.e., two parties which stand for the transition from bourgeois parliamentarism to Soviet power. Let one of these parties recognise participation in the bourgeois parliament, and the other reject it; this disagreement is now so immaterial that the most reasonable thing would be not to split over it. But even the joint existence of two such parties would be immense progress as compared with the present situation, would most likely be a transition to complete unity and the speedy victory of communism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Soviet power in Russia has not only shown by the experience of almost two years that the dictatorship of the proletariat is possible <I>even</I> in a peasant country and is capable, by creating a strong army (the best proof that organisation and order prevail), of holding out in unbelievably, exceptionally difficult conditions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Soviet power has done more: it has already achieved a moral victory <I>throughout</I> the world, for the working masses everywhere, although they get only tiny fragments of the truth about Soviet power, although they hear thousands and millions of false reports about Soviet power, <I>are already in favour of Soviet power.</I> It is already understood by the proletariat of the whole world that this power is the power of the working people, that it alone is salvation from capitalism, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 566</B></FONT><P>

from the yoke of capital, from wars between the imperialists, that it leads to lasting peace. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    That is why defeats of individual Soviet republics by the imperialists are possible, but it is impossible to conquer the world Soviet movement of the proletariat.

P.S. -- The following cutting from the Russian press will give you an example of our information about Britain: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "London, 25.8 (via Beloostrov). The London correspondent of the Copenhagen paper <I>Berlingske Tidende</I> wires on August 3rd concerning the Bolshevik movement in Britain: "The strikes which have occurred in the last few days and the recent revelations have shaken the confidence of the British in the immunity of their country to Bolshevism. At present the press is vigorously discussing this question, and the government is making every effort to establish that a "conspiracy" has existed for quite a long time and has had for its aim neither more nor less than the overthrow of the existing system. The British police have arrested a revolutionary bureau which, according to the press had both money and arms at its disposal. <I>The Times</I> publishes the contents of certain documents found on the arrested men. They contain a complete revolutionary programme, according to which the entire bourgeoisie are to be disarmed; arms and ammunition are to be obtained for Soviets of Workers' and Red Army Deputies and a Red Army formed; all government posts are to be filled by workers. Furthermore, it was planned to set up a revolutionary tribunal for political criminals and persons guilty of cruelly treating prisoners. All foodstuffs were to be confiscated. Parliament and other organs of public government were to be dissolved and revolutionary Soviets created in their place. The working day was to be lowered to six hours and the minimum weekly wage raised to £7. All state and other debts were to be annulled. All banks, industrial and commercial enterprises and means of transport were to be declared nationalised."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If this is true, then I must offer the British imperialists and capitalists, in the shape of their organ, the richest newspaper in the world, <I>The Times</I>, my respectful gratitude and thanks for their excellent propaganda in behalf of Bolshevism. Carry on in the same spirit, gentlemen of <I>The Times</I>, you are splendidly leading Britain to the victory of Bolshevism!

   <I>Sylvia Pankhurst</I>, a British politician who was a member of the Communist Party in 1919, wrote to Lenin asking his opinion on the question of participation in parliament. Her letter described the parties and groups in Great Britain, under the following numbers: 1. Trade unionists and working-class politicians of the old type. 2. The Independent Labour Party. 3. The British Socialist Party. 4. Revolutionary industrialists. 5. The Socialist Labour Party. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 587</B></FONT><P>

6. The Socialist Labour Federation. 7. The South Wales Socialist Society. Lenin retained these numbers in his reply.

   This refers to the Inaugural Congress of the Communist Party of Germany, held in Berlin from December 30, 1918 to January 1, 1919. Despite the speeches by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg proposing participation in the elections to the National Assembly, the Congress, by a majority vote (62 against 23) adopted the erroneous decision not to participate in the election campaign.

   <I>The British Socialist Party</I> was founded in 1911 in Manchester when the Social-Democratic Party joined forces with other socialist groups. The B.S.P. conducted its propaganda in the spirit of Marxism and, as Lenin said, was "not opportunist" and was "really independent of the Liberals" (present edition, Vol. 19, p. 273 &nbsp; [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>Transcriber's Note</I></FONT>: See Lenin's "<A HREF="EBO13.html">Exposure of the British Opportunists</A>". -- <FONT SIZE=-2><I>DJR</I></FONT>]). The small membership of the party and its poor contact with the masses gave it a somewhat sectarian character. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   During the First World War a sharp struggle developed in the party between the internationalist trend (Albert Inkpin, Theodore Rothstein, John MacLean, William Gallacher and others) and the social-chauvinist trend headed by Hyndman. Within the internationalist trend there were inconsistent elements who adopted a Centrist position on some questions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   In February 1916 a group of B.S.P. members founded <I>The Call</I>, a weekly paper which played an important part in mustering the internationalists. The annual B.S.P. Conference, held in Salford in April 1916, condemned the social-chauvinist position of Hyndman and his supporters and they withdrew from the party. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The B.S.P. welcomed the October Revolution and its members played an important part in the British workers' movement against intervention in Russia. In 1919, most of the local party organisations (98 for and 4 against) decided to join the Communist International; the B.S.P. and the Communist Unity Group were actually the founders of the Communist Party of Great Britain. At the First Unity Congress in 1920 most local B.S.P. organisations entered the Communist Party.
