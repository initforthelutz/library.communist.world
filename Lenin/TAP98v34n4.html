<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Yesterday I received your letter of August 11 with the list of books and the printed matter -- the <I>Archiv.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en13">13</A>]</FONT> The article of the "eminent political economist" is highly interesting and excellently composed. The author evidently disposed of very rich material, which had luckily fallen into his hands. Generally speaking, in the journalistic field, he appears to be even a better writer than in the purely economic field. <I>Archiv</I>, in general, is an interesting journal and I shall certainly subscribe to it for next year. I should like also to subscribe to some English periodical or newspaper (weekly); can you advise me which to select? I have no idea what there is in the English publicistic field that is most interesting and is available<A NAME="p25b"> in Russia. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   As regards Struve's article,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en14">14</A>]</FONT> on which we hold different opinions, it has to be said, of course, that it is impossible to judge accurately of the author's views from it alone. It seemed to me, for instance, and still seems to me, that he definitely set himself "general classificatory tasks" (the title itself indicates this), whereas you consider that he set himself "no such tasks". . . . That "it is necessary to win our handicraft workers away from so-called<A NAME="p25c"> people's industry" is something with which, of course, I am wholly and definitely in agreement, and I think that this still confronts our "disciples"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en15">15</A>]</FONT> as an unsolved problem. It was in Struve's article<A NAME="p25d"> that I saw a <I>plan</I> for solving this problem. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Have you paid attention to N. G.'s articles in <I>Russkoye Bogatstvo </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en16">16</A>]</FONT> (in the two last issues) against "materialism and dialectical logic". They are highly interesting -- from the negative aspect. I must admit that I am not competent 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 26</B></FONT><P>

to deal with the questions raised by the author, and I am extremely surprised that the author of <I>Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte des<A NAME="p26"> Materialismus </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#fnp26">*</A>]</FONT> has not expressed his opinion in the Russian literature and does not vigorously oppose neo-Kantianism, letting Struve and Bulgakov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en17">17</A>]</FONT><A NAME="p26a"> polemise on specific questions of this philosophy, as if it had already become part of the views of Russian disciples.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en18">18</A>]</FONT> Space would surely be found for philosophical articles in more than one of our periodicals; moreover, a book<A NAME="p26b"> could get through easily. His polemic with Bernstein and Conrad Schmidt interests me greatly, and I very much regret that I am quite unable to obtain <I>Zeit.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en19">19</A>]</FONT> I should be greatly obliged to you if you could help me in this. It would be quite sufficient, of course, to receive this journal even for a short period. Do you have<A NAME="p26c"> the issue of <I>Die Neue Zeit</I> (of a few years ago) which carried an article by the same author on Hegel (the 30th Anniversary of his death -- something of that kind)?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en20">20</A>]</FONT> Neither I nor any of the comrades here get <I>Die Neue Zeit</I>, although they promised to send it from St. Petersburg! The devil take all those people who make promises and do not keep them! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Another interesting article is that of Ratner's on <I>Capital</I> in <I>Russkoye Bogatstvo</I> (for July). I cannot stand such lovers of the golden mean, who do not dare to come out openly against doctrines with which they have no sympathy, but wriggle, make "amendments", evade the main issues (such as the theory of the class struggle) and beat about the bush of particulars.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The articles by another author in <I>Die Neue Zeit</I> on social trends in Russia also sound very interesting<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TAP98v34n4.html#en21">21</A>]</FONT>: your mentioning them is extremely tantalising. If I have understood you rightly, this author expresses an idea already expounded by him elsewhere (on the danger of <I>einer politischen Isolierung des russischen Proletariats </I>**). It seems to me that "alienation from society" does not necessarily signify "isolation",*** for there is society and society: in fighting Na-

From such people the disciples would hardly begin dissociating themselves unreservedly. Rather the contrary. A "conciliatory" (or, rather, alliancist) attitude towards such people is wholly compatible, in my opinion, with the fight against Narodism and all its manifestations.

In the early nineties it passed into the hands of the liberal Narodniks beaded by N. K. Mikhailovsky. The journal advocated a conciliatory attitude towards the tsarist government and conducted a bitter fight against Marxism and the Russian Marxists. In 1906 it became the organ of the semi-Cadet Trudovik Popular Socialist Party.

   <I>Die Neue Zeit</I> -- a theoretical journal of the German Social-Democratic Party, published in Stuttgart from 1883 to 1923. Up to October 1917 it was edited by K. Kautsky, and after him by Heinrich Cunow.

   The reference is to <I>Economism</I>, an opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. The Economists held that the political struggle against tsarism was mainly the business of the liberal bourgeoisie, while the workers were to confine themselves to an economic struggle for better working conditions, higher wages, etc. They denied the leading role of the party of the working class and the significance of revolutionary theory in the labour movement, and maintained that that movement could only develop spontaneously. Lenin gave a devastating criticism of Economism in his book <I><A HREF="WD02NB.html">What Is To Be Done?</A></I>

   <I>Narodism</I> -- a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian revolutionary movement, which arose between the 1860s and 1870s. The Narodniks were out to abolish the autocracy and hand over the landowners' land to the peasantry. At the same time they denied the development of capitalist relations in Russia to be a natural tendency, and accordingly regarded the peasantry, and not the proletariat, as the main revolutionary force, and the village commune as the embryo of socialism. With the object of rousing the peasants to the struggle against the autocracy the Narodniks went into the country, "among the people", but gained no support there. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks took a conciliatory stand towards tsarism, expressed the interests of the kulaks, and waged a bitter fight against Marxism.
