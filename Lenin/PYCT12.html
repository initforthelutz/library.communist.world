<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Our nobility, ministers, members of the Council of State, etc., are well acquainted with the language of the Duchy of Monaco.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PYCT12.html#en194">194</A>]</FONT> It is well known who introduced this language to our Council of State! That is why we were somewhat surprised when we came across the expression which heads this article, in <I>Zhivoye Dyelo</I>, No. 8. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But the important thing is not the mode of expression. The prestige among the liquidators of the writer using this expression (L. Martov), the importance of the subject touched on ("put your cards on the table" in relation to the election campaign, its principles, tactics, etc.), all this compels us to take up this slogan, irrespective of how it has been expressed. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Put your cards on the table" is an excellent slogan. And in the first place, we should like to see it applied to the paper <I>Zhivoye Dyelo.</I> Put your cards on the table, gentlemen! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   People who are experienced in literary affairs can immediately gauge the character of a publication by its contributors, even by isolated expressions which indicate the trend of the publication if that trend belongs to those in any degree established and well-known. Such people only need to take one glance at <I>Zhivoye Dyelo</I> to realise its adherence to the liquidationist trend. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But it is not so easy for the general public to understand the trend followed by newspapers, particularly when the subjects in question are not theoretical principles, but current politics. It is here that it is very important and appropriate to remember the extremely apt slogan put forward by L. Martov -- "Put your cards on the table". For it so happens that in <I>Zhivoye Dyelo</I> the cards are under the table!

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Those ideas which <I>Zhivoye Dyelo</I> is beginning to propound have been worked out at all systematically and consistently <I>only</I> in the course of the past two years in <I>Nasha Zarya</I>, <I>Zhizn</I>, <I>Vozrozhdeniye</I>, and <I>Dyelo Zhizni.</I> A considerable amount of material has accumulated in this period. What is lacking are <I>summaries</I>, particularly those produced by the people who for two years have been engaged in the elaboration of those ideas. What is lacking is an <I>open</I> exposition, by those holding liquidationist views, of the conclusions they have drawn from two years of "work by <I>Nasha Zarya.</I>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is precisely at this point that the lovers of talks about an "<I>open</I> workers' party" turn out to be lovers of a game with <I>hidden</I> cards. You read, for instance, in the leader appearing in No. 8, that "the path of the struggle for the general, for general improvement and <I>basic</I> change in working and living conditions" lies <I>through</I> "the defence of <I>partial</I> [author's italics] rights". You read in the same issue about some "Petersburg leaders of the open labour movement", that they "<I>as previously </I>" will . . . "popularise among Social-Democrats those methods for the revival and creation of a proletarian Social-Democratic party which they have hitherto defended". 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Put your cards on the table! What is this theory of the defence of partial rights? This theory has not been stated in any properly formulated, official, <I>openly</I> announced postulates, recognised by groups, or representatives of groups of workers. Is it, for instance, the theory propounded to us by V. Levitsky in <I>Nasha Zarya</I>, No. 11 for 1911? And then, how can the paper's readers know what methods were advocated by some unnamed leaders of the open movement, for the "revival and <I>creation</I> of the party", which apparently has not been created, i.e., does not exist? Why not name those leaders, if they are indeed leaders of an "open" movement, if these words are not merely a <I>conventional</I> phrase? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The question of "methods of revival and <I>creation</I> of the party" is not some incidental question, which can be touched on and resolved in passing among other political questions of interest to any newspaper. On the contrary, this is a basic question. It is impossible to talk about a Party 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 518</B></FONT><P>

election campaign, about the election tactics of the Party, about Party candidates, until this question has been resolved; and resolved it must be, in the most unambiguous, positive manner, for apart from a clear-cut theoretical answer, a <I>practical</I> decision is required. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The arguments which we frequently meet with to the effect that during an election campaign the elements of revival and creation of the Party, etc., etc., will emerge or rally, are sophistry, and sophistry of the worst kind. It is sophistry because a party is something <I>organised </I>! There is not and cannot be an election campaign for the working class, without decisions, <I>tactics</I>, a platform, and candidates <I>common to</I> the whole class, or at any rate to its advanced section. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Sophistry of this kind, obscure statements made in the name of anonymous, unknown, and -- <I>for the proletariat</I> -- elusive open leaders (who does not call himself a "leader of the open labour movement"? How many bourgeois shelter behind this name?) -- all this represents a great danger which the worker must be warned against. The danger is that all this talk about "open action" is meant <I>merely as a blind</I> while in reality, the worst form of <I>hidden</I> dictatorship of a group results. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   They inveigh against the "underground" although it is there we see open decisions which have now become pretty well known thanks to the bourgeois press (<I>Golos Zemli</I>, <I>Kievskaya Mysl</I>, <I>Russkoye Slovo</I>, <I>Golos Moskvy</I>, <I>Novoye Vremya</I> -- how many <I>hundreds of thousands</I> of readers have now been <I>openly</I> informed of quite definite decisions, which mean genuine unity in the election campaign). It is those who cry out <I>against</I> the underground or <I>for</I> "open political activity" who provide an example of people leaving one shore and not landing on the other. The "old" has been abandoned, but there is only talk of the "new". 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We know, and all <I>openly</I> know, that "the methods of revival and creation" spoken of by <I>Zhivoye Dyelo</I> are merely those which have been developed and defended in <I>Nasha Zarya.</I> We know of no others, either stated openly or in any other form. There has been no attempt whatsoever to discuss these methods, openly or otherwise, by representatives of the groups, nor has <I>any</I> formal and properly formulated, 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 519</B></FONT><P>

official <I>exposition</I> of these methods been made. They use the <I>words</I> "open", "openly" in a hundred ways to cover what is really something completely closed in the full meaning of the word, something emanating from a circle, from a coterie of writers. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We know some writers, who are responsible to no one, and are indistinguishable from the free-lances of the bourgeois press. We know <I>their</I> speeches about "methods", about the liquidation of the "old". 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We know nothing more, and nobody knows anything more about <I>open</I> political activity. Here you have a paradox -- it seems to be a paradox, but in reality it is a direct and natural product of <I>all</I> the conditions of Russian life -- that through the above-mentioned series of the most widespread bourgeois papers, the masses were informed more accurately, swiftly and directly about "underground" political activities, decisions, slogans, tactics, etc., than about the <I>non-existent</I> decisions of "the leaders of the open movement"! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Or maybe someone will assert that an election campaign can be carried out without formulated decisions? That it is possible for tens and hundreds of thousands of voters scattered all over the country to determine tactics, platform, agreements and candidacies without formulated decisions? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In speaking of "putting cards on the table " Martov touched the liquidators' raw spot, and it is impossible to overestimate the effort that must be made to warn the workers. The masses are offered . . . the thoughts and projects of "leaders of the open movement", who are <I>not openly named</I>, that is, the Potresovs, Levitskys, Chatskys, Yezhovs, and Larins, without formulated decisions, without any definite replies to practical questions, without the participation of at least tens or hundreds of advanced workers in the discussion of every sentence, every word of the important decisions. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   They keep their cards hidden because any attempt to turn them face up would reveal quite clearly to the workers that all this has nothing to do with a working-class party or a working-class policy, that it is preaching by <I>liberal</I> publicists who take a liberal's attitude to the workers, who liquidate the old and are powerless to provide anything new to replace it. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 520</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The danger is great. Under cover of phrases about the "open" tomorrow, the workers are left <I>not only</I> without an "open" decision, but <I>without any</I> decision <I>at all</I> on the urgent practical problems of the present election campaign, of present-day Party life. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Let class-conscious workers give some thought to this dangerous situation.

  P.S. (1) Please send immediately books on the electoral law of June 3, 1907, or another copy of the handbook of 1910.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PYCT12.html#en195">195</A>]</FONT> Also the electoral<A NAME="p520a"> <I>law</I> with the comments of a <I>lawyer.</I> Consult "your people" and send them promptly. Unless I get them I cannot work on the voter's handbook.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PYCT12.html#en196">196</A>]</FONT> (2) I am again receiving <I>Zvezda</I> irregularly. Speak about it again in your dispatch department. Give my (old) address. It mustn't be sent so irregularly. (3) The article "Fundamentals of a Platform" <I>does not</I> require the approval of the Editorial Board; publish it with the signature and with the subheading "An Essay in Comment"; the Board must <I>not</I> approve <I>any</I> platform; remember, one clumsy step and a squabble is unavoidable. Let the Board refrain and keep silent. The approval of the platform is the job of quite another body. (4) Send me newspapers, journals, books. It is impossible to work without them. (5) Write and tell me exactly when a daily newspaper is likely to come out, its size, etc. (6) Fight against <I>Zhivoye Dyelo</I> more energetically -- then victory is guaranteed. Otherwise things will be bad. Don't be afraid of polemics. Two or three polemical articles a week are imperative.

   The pamphlet <I>Voter's Handbook</I> (<I>Our Election Law </I>) was published in St. Petersburg in 1912. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    Lenin attached great importance to the publication of the <I>Voter's Handbook</I> and compiled and edited the material for this book. In a letter to the Editorial Board of <I>Zvezda</I> dated April 9 (22), 1912, he recommended that the 2nd and 3rd chapters of his article "<A HREF="CEFD11.html">The Campaign for the Elections to the Fourth Duma</A>" be included (see pp. 372-84 of this volume). He urged that they issue a "serious work" which "would be of value as an effective guide to the elections". However, the <I>Zvezda</I> editors were able to issue only the first part of the book which dealt with the electoral law and the regulations concerning the elections to the Duma.
