<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   After the above lines had gone to press, we received <I>Nevsky Golos</I> No. 7, published in St. Petersburg on August 17, old style. Consequently, the liquidationist newspaper has resumed publication after an <I>interruption of one and a half months.</I> (The previous issue of this weekly -- No. 6 -- appeared on July 5, old style.) 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The information published in <I>Nevsky Golos</I> No. 7 provides the best confirmation of the appraisal of the <I>actual</I> significance of the liquidators in Russia which was given in our Central Committee's letter to the <I>Vorstand.</I>* 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Indeed, early in July the paper suspended publication. Needless to say, the liquidators and their friends bent all their efforts to revive it. The results of their efforts <I>during one and a half months</I> (July and half August) are reported by <I>Nevsky Golos itself</I> (No. 7) as follows: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "This newspaper has received, <I>for the replenishment of its funds </I>: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
    <I>July.</I>&nbsp; From 14 persons, 25 rubles each (I. F., P., G., M. I., K., L., K. F., L., B., Vsh., Lv., Vl., V.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Such is the account published by the liquidators themselves. Their work and their <I>links with the masses</I> during the one and a half months present the following picture:

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Everyone knows, as Plekhanov stated in print (<I>Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata</I> No. 16) as far back as April 1912, that the "<I>initiating groups </I>" are groups of <I>liquidators.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And so, the liquidators were helped, at the most trying moment, when their paper had suspended publication, by: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>one</I> group of liquidators in Russia 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>one</I> group of friends in Paris 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   35 well-to-do persons, each of whom contributed an average of 20 rubles (over 40 marks each) 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   15 private individuals, each of whom contributed an average of 5 rubles (over 10 marks each). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Was not our Central Committee justified in asserting that the liquidators in the Russian working-class movement were of no account at all? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The liquidators refer to the "Caucasian Regional Committee". <I>Not a single workers' group</I> in the Caucasus has sent 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 223</B></FONT><P>

them a single contribution during those one and a half months. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The liquidators would like to have the help of the Bund and the Lettish Social-Democratic organisation. <I>Not a single</I> workers' group, either in the Bund or among the Letts, has sent them a single contribution during one and a half months. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   During the same period (July to August 14) <I>Pravda</I>, the St. Petersburg daily newspaper of the anti-liquidators, published accounts of <I>41 group collections by workers</I> in various parts of Russia, including oil-field workers (Grozny fields, Terek Region) (<I>Pravda</I> No. 60) and Jewish workers in Lepaya (<I>Pravda</I> No. 67). We venture to think that this aid from workers means more than all the talk and declamation of the "Caucasian Regional Committee", the Letts and the Bund. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   No aid in the world, and no "conferences" with the Letts, the Bund, etc., can transform the liquidationist <I>nothing</I> in the Russian working-class movement into a something. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Let the German comrades undertake the not too arduous task of collecting the documents on the position of the R.S.D.L.P. and verifying them‹after all, Russia is not Central Africa, about which any kind of "tall stories" can be told. The German comrades probably want to end this strange, <I>gelinde gesagt</I>,* situation in which they get their information on the Italian, Swedish and any other socialist movement from openly published documents, while their information on the Russian socialist movement is obtained from privately communicated fables and gossip.
