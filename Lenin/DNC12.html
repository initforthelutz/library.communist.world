                                  DEMOCRACY AND NARODISM IN CHINA<P><BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The article by Sun Yat-sen, provisional President of the Chinese Republic, which we take from the Brussels socialist newspaper, <I>Le Peuple</I>, is of exceptional interest to us Russians. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is said that the onlooker sees most of the game. And Sun Yat-sen is a most interesting "onlooker", for he appears to be wholly uninformed about Russia despite his European education. And now, quite independently of Russia, of Russian experience and Russian literature, this enlightened spokesman of militant and victorious Chinese democracy, which has won a republic, poses purely Russian questions. A progressive Chinese democrat, he argues exactly like a Russian. His similarity to a Russian Narodnik is so great that it goes as far as a complete identity of fundamental ideas and of many individual expressions. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The onlooker sees most of the game. The platform of the great Chinese democracy -- for that is what Sun Yat-sen's article represents -- impels us, and provides us with a convenient occasion, to examine anew, in the light of recent world events, the relation between democracy and Narodism in modern bourgeois revolutions in Asia. This is one of the most serious questions confronting Russia in the revolutionary epoch which began in 1905. And it confronts not only Russia, but the whole of Asia, as will be seen from the platform of the provisional President of the Chinese Republic, particularly when this platform is compared with the revolutionary developments in Russia, Turkey, Persia and China. In very many and very essential respects, Russia is undoubtedly an Asian country and, what is more, one of 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 164</B></FONT><P>

the most benighted, medieval and shamefully backward of Asian countries. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Beginning with its distant and lone forerunner, the nobleman Herzen, and continuing right up to its mass representatives, the members of the Peasant Union of 1905 and the Trudovik deputies to the first three Dumas of 1906-12, Russian bourgeois democracy has had a Narodnik colouring. Bourgeois democracy in China, as we now see, has the same Narodnik colouring. Let us now consider, with Sun Yat-sen as an example, the "social significance" of the ideas generated by the deep-going revolutionary movement of the hundreds of millions who are finally being drawn into the stream of world capitalist civilisation. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Every line of Sun Yat-sen's platform breathes a spirit of militant and sincere democracy. It reveals a thorough understanding of the inadequacy of a "racial" revolution. There is not a trace in it of indifference to political issues, or even of underestimation of political liberty, or of the idea that Chinese "social reform", Chinese constitutional reforms, etc., could be compatible with Chinese autocracy. It stands for complete democracy and the demand for a republic. It squarely poses the question of the condition of the masses, of the mass struggle. It expresses warm sympathy for the toiling and exploited people, faith in their strength and in the justice of their cause. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Before us is the truly great ideology of a truly great people capable not only of lamenting its age-long slavery and dreaming of liberty and equality, but of <I>fighting</I> the age-long oppressors of China. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   One is naturally inclined to compare the provisional President of the Republic in benighted, inert, Asiatic China with the presidents of various republics in Europe and America, in countries of advanced culture. The presidents in those republics are all businessmen, agents or puppets of a bourgeoisie rotten to the core and besmirched from head to foot with mud and blood -- not the blood of padishahs and emperors, but the blood of striking workers shot down in the name of progress and civilisation. In those countries the presidents represent the bourgeoisie, which long ago renounced all the ideals of its youth, has thoroughly prostituted itself, sold itself body and soul to the millionaires 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 165</B></FONT><P>

and multimillionaires, to the feudal lords turned bourgeois, etc. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In China, the Asiatic provisional President of the Republic is a revolutionary democrat, endowed with the nobility and heroism of a class that is rising, not declining, a class that does not dread the future, but believes in it and fights for it selflessly, a class that does not cling to maintenance and restoration of the past in order to safeguard its privileges, but hates the past and knows how to cast off its dead and stifling decay. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Does that mean, then, that the materialist West has hopelessly decayed and that light shines only from the mystic, religious East? No, quite the opposite. It means that the East has definitely taken the Western path, that new <I>hundreds of millions</I> of people will from now on share in the struggle for the ideals which the West has already worked out for itself. What has decayed is the Western bourgeoisie, which is already confronted by its grave-digger, the proletariat. But in Asia there is <I>still</I> a bourgeoisie capable of championing sincere, militant, consistent democracy, a worthy comrade of France's great men of Enlightenment and great leaders of the close of the eighteenth century. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The chief representative, or the chief social bulwark, of this Asian bourgeoisie that is still capable of supporting a historically progressive cause, is the peasant. And side by side with him there already exists a liberal bourgeoisie whose leaders, men like Yuan Shih-kai, are above all capable of treachery: yesterday they feared the emperor, and cringed before him; then they betrayed him when they saw the strength, and sensed the victory, of the revolutionary democracy; and tomorrow they will betray the democrats to make a deal with some old or new "constitutional" emperor. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The real emancipation of the Chinese people from age-long slavery would be impossible without the great, sincerely democratic enthusiasm which is rousing the working masses and making them capable of miracles, and which is evident from every sentence of Sun Yat-sen's platform. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But the Chinese Narodnik combines this ideology of militant democracy, firstly, with socialist dreams, with hopes of China avoiding the capitalist path, of preventing capitalism, and, secondly, with a plan for, and advocacy of, radical 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 166</B></FONT><P>

agrarian reform. It is these two last ideological and political trends that constitute the element which forms <I>Narodism</I> -- Narodism in the specific sense of that term, i.e., as distinct from democracy, as a supplement to democracy. What is the origin and significance of these trends? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Had it not been for the immense spiritual and revolutionary upsurge of the masses, the Chinese democracy would have been unable to overthrow the old order and establish the republic. Such an upsurge presupposes and evokes the most sincere sympathy for the condition of the working masses, and the bitterest hatred for their oppressors and exploiters. And in Europe and America -- from which the progressive Chinese, <I>all</I> the Chinese who have experienced this upsurge, have borrowed their ideas of liberation -- emancipation <I>from</I> the bourgeoisie, i.e., socialism, is the immediate task. This is bound to arouse sympathy for socialism among Chinese democrats, and is the source of their <I>subjective</I> socialism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   They are subjectively socialists because they are opposed to oppression and exploitation of the masses. But the <I>objective</I> conditions of China, a backward, agricultural, semi-feudal country numbering nearly 500 million people, place on the order of the day only one specific, historically distinctive form of this oppression and exploitation, namely, feudalism. Feudalism was based on the predominance of agriculture and natural economy. The source of the feudal exploitation of the Chinese peasant was his <I>attachment</I> to the land in some form. The political exponents of this exploitation were the feudal lords, all together and individually, with the emperor as the head of the whole system. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But it appears that out of the subjectively socialist ideas and programmes of the Chinese democrat there emerges in fact a programme for "changing all the juridical foundations" of "immovable property" <I>alone</I>, a programme for the abolition of feudal exploitation <I>alone.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   That is the <I>essence</I> of Sun Yat-sen's Narodism, of his progressive, militant, revolutionary programme for bourgeois democratic agrarian reform, and of his quasi-socialist theory. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   From the point of view of doctrine, this theory is that of a petty-bourgeois "socialist" reactionary. For the idea that capitalism can be "prevented" in China and that a "social revolution" there will be made easier by the country's back- 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 167</B></FONT><P>

wardness, and so on, is altogether reactionary. And Sun Yat-sen himself, with inimitable, one might say virginal, na&iuml;vet&eacute;, smashes his reactionary Narodnik theory by admitting what reality forces him to admit, namely, that "China is on the eve of a gigantic industrial [i.e., capitalist] development", that in China "trade [i.e., capitalism] will develop to an enormous extent", that "in fifty years we shall have many Shanghais", i.e., huge centres of capitalist wealth and proletarian need and poverty. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But the question arises: does Sun Yat-sen, on the basis of his reactionary economic theory, uphold an actually reactionary agrarian programme? That is the crux of the matter, its most interesting point, and one on which curtailed and emasculated liberal quasi-Marxism is often at a loss. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The fact of the matter is that he does not. The dialectics of the social relations in China reveals itself precisely in the fact that, while sincerely sympathising with socialism in Europe, the Chinese democrats have transformed it into a reactionary theory, and <I>on the basis</I> of this reactionary theory of "preventing" capitalism are championing a <I>purely capitalist</I>, a maximum capitalist, agrarian programme! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Indeed, what does the "economic revolution", of which Sun Yat-sen talks so pompously and obscurely at the beginning of his article, amount to? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It amounts to the transfer of rent to the state, i.e., land nationalisation, by some sort of single tax along Henry George lines. There is absolutely nothing else that is <I>real</I> in the "economic revolution" proposed and advocated by Sun Yat-sen. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The difference between the value of land in some remote peasant area and in Shanghai is the difference in the rate of rent. The value of land is capitalised rent. To make the "enhanced value" of land the "property of the people" means transferring the rent, i.e., land ownership, to the state, or, in other words, nationalising the land. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Is such a reform possible within the framework of capitalism? It is not only possible but it represents the purest, most consistent, and ideally perfect capitalism. Marx pointed this out in <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/PP47.html">The Poverty of Philosophy</A></I>, he proved it in detail in Volume III of <I>Capital</I>, and developed it with partic- 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 168</B></FONT><P>

ular clarity in his controversy with Rodbertus in <I>Theories of Surplus Value.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Land nationalisation makes it possible to abolish absolute rent, leaving only differential rent. According to Marx's theory, land nationalisation means a maximum elimination of medieval monopolies and medieval relations in agriculture, maximum freedom in buying and selling land, and maximum facilities for agriculture to adapt itself to the market. The irony of history is that Narodism, under the guise of "combating capitalism" in agriculture, champions an agrarian programme that, if fully carried out, would mean the <I>most</I> rapid development of capitalism in agriculture. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What economic necessity is behind the spread of the most progressive bourgeois-democratic agrarian programmes in one of the most backward peasant countries of Asia? It is the necessity of destroying feudalism in all its forms and manifestations. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The more China lagged behind Europe and Japan, the more it was threatened with fragmentation and national disintegration. It could be "renovated" only by the heroism of the revolutionary masses, a heroism capable of creating a Chinese republic in the sphere of politics, and of ensuring, through land nationalisation, the most rapid capitalist progress in the sphere of agriculture. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Whether and to what extent this will succeed is another question. In their bourgeois revolutions, various countries achieved various degrees of political and agrarian democracy, and in the most diverse combinations. The decisive factors will be the international situation and the alignment of the social forces in China. The emperor will certainly try to unite the feudal lords, the bureaucracy and the clergy in an attempt at restoration. Yuan Shih-kai, who represents a bourgeoisie that has only just changed from liberal monarchist to liberal-republican (for how long?), will pursue a policy of manoeuvring between monarchy and revolution. The revolutionary bourgeois democracy, represented by Sun Yat-sen, is correct in seeking ways and means of "renovating" China through maximum development of the initiative, determination and boldness of the peasant masses in the matter of political and agrarian reforms. 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 169</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Lastly, the Chinese proletariat will increase as the number of Shanghais increases. It will probably form some kind of Chinese Social-Democratic labour party which, while criticising the petty-bourgeois utopias and reactionary views of Sun Yat-sen, will certainly take care to single out, defend and develop the revolutionary-democratic core of his political and agrarian programme.
