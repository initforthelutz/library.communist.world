  <I>To Comrades Kamenev</I>, <I>Zinoviev</I>, <I>Ryazanov and Larin</I>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Once before, the Central Committee delivered an ultimatum to the leading exponents of your policy (Kamenev and Zinoviev), demanding complete subordination to the Central Committee's line and decisions, and renunciation of efforts to sabotage its work and of all subversive activity.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FCCa17.html#fnp301">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   By leaving the Central Committee, but remaining in the Party, the exponents of your policy undertook to abide by Central Committee decisions. Actually, however, you have not confined yourselves to criticism within the Party, but have brought confusion into the ranks of the fighters in an uprising which is still going on, and continue, in violation of Party discipline, to frustrate Central Committee decisions and hamper its work outside the Party, in the Soviets, the municipal bodies, the trade unions, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In view of this, the Central Committee is forced to restate its ultimatum and to request that you immediately pledge yourselves in writing either to abide by Central Committee decisions and to conduct its policy in all your statements, or to withdraw from all Party activity in public and resign from all responsible posts in the working-class movement until the next Party congress.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Refusal to pledge yourselves to either course will make it imperative for the Central Committee to consider the question of your immediate expulsion from the Party.
