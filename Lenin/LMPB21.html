<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Having now fully read the platform "We Are Collectivists" (<I>Vperyod</I>-ites, Bogdanov-ites, Proletcult people, etc.),<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LMPB21.html#en449">449</A>]</FONT> I have finally come to the conclusion that it would be unquestionably useful for us and necessary <I>to print</I> it as a pamphlet in 2,000-3,000 copies, with the <I>most circumstantial</I> critique, with an addition of an article on Bogdanov's political statements in 1917, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I propose that <I>a number of authors</I> should be asked to write a pamphlet under the editorship of Bukharin, who should be authorised to share it out between the authors, obtain their manuscripts within two weeks and <I>show the Politbureau in proof.</I> (This is also necessary for <I>foreign countries.</I>)

   This platform was an anonymous document expressing the views of some intellectuals, and was issued for the Second All-Russia Proletcult Congress held in Moscow in November 1921. They cast doubt on the socialist character of the October Revolution and came out against the policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government; in philosophy they stood up for Machist and Bogdanovite "theories", and in politics adopted the views of the opportunist Workers' Opposition. The communist group

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 696</B></FONT><P>

of the Second Proletcult Congress condemned the "collectivist" platform and dissociated itself from it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Proletcult (Proletarian Culture Organisation) was set up in September 1917 as an independent workers' organisation. Proletcult, whose direction was in the hands of A. Bogdanov and his supporters, continued, even after the October Revolution, to maintain its "independence", thereby setting itself up in opposition to the Communist Party and the proletarian state. It was not a homogeneous organisation: alongside bourgeois intellectuals, who dominated many of its organisations, there were young workers who were sincerely desirous of taking part in cultural construction. In a number of his works, Lenin sharply criticised Proletcult's erroneous views. Proletcult organisations were most widespread in 1919, but declined in the early 1920s and were dissolved in 1932. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Lenin's proposal for a pamphlet exposing the "collectivist" platform was adopted by the Politbureau of the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. on December 3, 1921. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The "C.C. circulars" mentioned in the text are the R.C.P.(B.) C.C. letter "On the Proletcults" (see <I>Pravda</I> No. 270, December 1, 1920) and the Politbureau's decision on the Proletcults of November 22, 1921, published in <I>Izvestia R.C.P.(B.) C.C.</I> No. 36 for 1921.
