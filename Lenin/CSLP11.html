FROM THE CAMP OF THE STOLYPIN “LABOUR” PARTY 
DEDICATED TO OUR “CONCILIATORS” AND ADVOCATES OF “AGREEMENT”

242

<p>Comrade K.’s[124] letter deserves the profound attention of all to whom our Party is dear. A better exposure of <i>Golospolicy</i> (and of <i>Golos</i> diplomacy), a better refutation of the views and hopes of our “conciliators” and advocates of “agreement” it is hard to imagine.</p>

<p>Is the case cited by Comrade K. an exception? No, it is <i>typical</i> of the advocates of a Stolypin labour party, for we know very well that a number of writers in <i>Nasha Zarya</i>, <i>Dyelo Zhizni</i>, etc., have <i>already</i> been systematically preaching <i>these very</i> liquidationist ideas <i>for many a year</i>. These liquidators do not often meet worker members of the Party - the Party very rarely receives such exact information of their disgraceful utterances as that for which we have to thank Comrade K.; but, <i>always and everywhere</i>, the preaching of the <i>group</i> of independent legalists is conducted precisely in this spirit. It is impossible to doubt this when periodicals of the <i>Nasha Zarya</i> and <i>Dyelo Zhizni</i> type exist. It is to the advantage of only the most cowardly and most despicable defenders of the liquidators to keep silent about this.</p>

<p>Compare this fact with the methods employed by people like Trotsky, who shout about “agreement” and about their hostility to the liquidators. We know these methods only too well; these people shout at the top of their voices that they are “neither Bolsheviks nor Mensheviks, but revolutionary Social-Democrats”; they zealously vow and swear that they are foes of liquidationism and staunch defenders of the illegal R.S.D.L.P.; <i>they vociferously abuse those who</i></p>

<i>expose the liquidators, the Potresovs</i>; they say that the anti-liquidators are “exaggerating” the issue; but <i>do not say a word</i> against the definite liquidators, Potresov, Martov, Levitsky, Dan, Larin, and so on.

The real purpose of such methods is obvious. They usephrase-mongering to shield the real liquidators and doeverything to hamper the work of the anti-liquidators.This was exactly the policy pursued by Rabocheye Dyelo,125so notorious in the history of the R.S.D.L.P. for its unprin-cipled character; it vowed and swore, “We are not Econo-mists, not at all, we are wholly in favour of political strug-gle”; but in reality it provided a screen for RabochayaMysl126 and the Economists, directing its whole struggleagainst those who exposed and refuted the Economists.Hence it is clear that Trotsky and the “Trotskyites andconciliators” like him are more pernicious than any liquida-tor; the convinced liquidators state their views bluntly,and it is easy for the workers to detect where they are wrong,whereas the Trotskys deceive the workers, cover up the evil,and make it impossible to expose the evil and to remedy it.Whoever supports Trotsky’s puny group supports a policyof lying and of deceiving the workers, a policy of shieldingthe liquidators. Full freedom of action for Potresov and Co.in Russia, and the shielding of their deeds by “revolution-ary” phrase-mongering abroad—there you have the essenceof the policy of “Trotskyism”.Hence it is clear, furthermore, that any “agreement” withthe Golos group that evades the question of the liquidators’centre in Russia, that is, the leading lights of Nasha Zaryaand Dyelo Zhizni, would be nothing but a continuation ofthis deception of the workers, this covering up of the evil.Since the Plenary Meeting of January 1910 the Golos sup-porters have made it abundantly clear that they are capableof “subscribing” to any resolution, not allowing any resolu-tion “to hamper the freedom” of their liquidationist activi-ties one iota. Abroad they subscribe to resolutions sayingthat any disparagement of the importance of the illegalParty is evidence of bourgeois influence among the proletar-iat, while in Russia they assist the Potresovs, Larins, andLevitskys, who, far from taking part in illegal work, scoffat it and try to destroy the illegal Party.
V. I. LENIN244At present Trotsky, together with Bundists like Mr.Lieber (an extreme liquidator, who publicly defended Mr.Potresov in his lectures and who now, in order to hush upthe fact, is stirring up squabbles and conflicts), togetherwith Letts like Schwartz,127 and so on, is concocting justsuch an “agreement” with the Golos group. Let nobody bedeceived on this score: their agreement will be an agreementto shield the liquidators.-P. S. These lines were already set up when reports appearedin the press of an “agreement” between the Golos groupand Trotsky, the Bundist and the Lett liquidator. Our wordshave been fully borne out: this is an agreement to shieldthe liquidators in Russia, an agreement between the ser-vants of the Potresovs.Sotsial-Demokrat,No.23,PublishedaccordingtoSeptember14(1),1911theSotsial-Demokrattext

This proposal was met with a unanimous rebuff, no one voting in its favour. p. 242
