</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  According to the author's original plan, the present pamphlet was to have been devoted to a detailed development of the ideas expressed in the article "Where To Begin?" (<I>Iskra</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n2">2</A>]</FONT> No. 4, May 19O1).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n3">3</A>]</FONT> And we must first of all apologize to the reader for the delay in fulfilling the promise made in that article (and repeated in reply to many private in quiries and letters). One of the reasons for this delay was the attempt made last June (1901) to unite all the Social-Democratic organizations abroad. It was natural to wait for the results <A NAME="p2"> of this attempt, for if it were successful it would perhaps have been necessary to expound the <I>Iskra</I>'s views on organization from a somewhat different angle; and in any case, such a success promised to put a very early end to the existence of the two trends in the Russian Social-Democratic movement. As the reader knows, the attempt failed, and, as we shall try to show here, was bound to fail after the new swing of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n4">4</A>]</FONT> in its issue No. 10, towards Economism. It proved absolutely essential to commence a determined fight against this diffuse and ill-defined, but very persistent trend, one capable of appearing 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 3</B></FONT><P>

again in diverse forms. Accordingly, the original plan of the pamphlet was altered and very considerably enlarged. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p3">
   Its main theme was to have been the three questions raised in the article "Where To Begin?" -- viz., the character and principal content of our political agitation, our organizational tasks; and the plan for building, simultaneously and from various ends, a militant, all-Russian organization. These questions have long engaged the mind of the author, who already tried to raise them in the <I>Rabochaya Gazeta </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n5">5</A>]</FONT> during one of the unsuccessful attempts to revive that paper (see Chap. V). But the original plan to confine this pamphlet to an analysis of only these three questions and to set forth our views as far as possible in a positive form, without entering, or almost without entering, into polemics, proved quite impracticable for two reasons. One was that Economism proved to be much more tenacious than we had sup posed (we employ the term Economism in the broad sense, as explained in the <I>Iskra</I>, No. 12 [December 1901], in an article entitled "A Conversation With the Advocates of Economism," which was a synopsis, so to speak, of the present pamphlet<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n6">6</A>]</FONT>). It became clear beyond doubt that the differences as to how these three questions should be answered were due much more to the fundamental antithesis between the two trends in the Russian Social-Democratic movement than to differences over details. The second reason was that the perplexity displayed by the Economists over the practical application of our views in the <I>Iskra</I> revealed quite clearly that we often speak literally different languages, that therefore we <I>cannot</I> come to any understanding without beginning ab ovo, and that an attempt must be made, in the simplest possible style and illustrated by numerous and concrete examples, <I> systematically to "thrash out" all</I> our fundamental 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 4</B></FONT><P>

points of difference with <I>all</I> the Economists. I resolved to make such an attempt to "thrash out" the differences, fully realizing that it would greatly increase the size of the pamphlet and delay its publication, but at the same time I saw <I>no other way</I> of fulfilling the promise I made in the article "Where To Begin?" Thus, in addition to apologizing for the delay, I must apologize for the numerous literary shortcomings of the pamphlet. I had to work in the <I>greatest of haste</I>, and was moreover frequently interrupted by other work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The examination of the three questions mentioned above still constitutes the main theme of this pamphlet, but I found it necessary to begin with two questions of a more general nature, viz., why an "innocent" and "natural" slogan like "freedom of criticism" should be a real fighting challenge for us, and why we cannot come to an understanding even on the fundamental question of the role of Social-Democrats in relation to the spontaneous mass movement. Further, the exposition of our views on the character and substance of political agitation developed into an explanation of the difference between a trade-unionist policy and Social-Democratic policy, while the exposition of our views on organizational tasks developed into an explanation of the difference between the amateurish methods which satisfy the Economists, and an organization of revolutionaries which in our opinion is indispensable. Further, I advance the "plan" for an all-Russian political newspaper with all the more insistence because of the flimsiness of the objections raised against it, and because no real answer has been given to the question I raised in the article "Where To Begin?" as to how we can set to work from all sides simultaneously to erect the organization we need. Finally, in the concluding part of this pamphlet, I hope to show that we did all we could to 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 5</B></FONT><P>

prevent a decisive rupture with the Economists, which nevertheless proved inevitable; that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> has acquired a special significance, a "historical" significance, if you will, because it most fully and most graphically expressed, not consistent Economism, but the confusion and vacillation which constitute the distinguishing feature of <I>a whole period</I> in the history of the Russian Social-Democratic movement; and that therefore the controversy with the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, which may at first sight seem to be waged in too excessive detail, also acquires significance, for we can make no progress until we finally put an end to this period.

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  "Freedom of criticism" is undoubtedly the most fashionable slogan at the present time, and the one most frequently employed in the controversies between the Socialists and democrats of all countries. At first sight, nothing would appear to be more strange than the solemn appeals by one of the parties to the dispute to freedom of criticism. Have voices been raised in the advanced parties against the constitutional law of the majority of European countries which guarantees freedom to science and scientific investigation? "Something must be wrong here," will be the comment of the onlooker, who has not yet fully grasped the essence of the disagreements among the disputants, but has heard this fashionable slogan repeated at every crossroad. "Evidently this slogan is one of the conventional phrases which, like a nickname, becomes legitimatized by use, and becomes almost an appellative," he will conclude. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 7</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In fact, it is no secret that two trends have taken shape in the present-day international<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np7">*</A>]</FONT> Social-Democracy. The fight between these trends now flares up in a bright flame, and now dies down and smoulders under the ashes of imposing "truce resolutions." What this "new" trend, which adopts a "critical" attitude towards "obsolete dogmatic" Marxism, represents has with sufficient precision been <I>stated</I> by Bernstein, and <I>demonstrated</I> by Millerand.  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Social-Democracy must change from a party of the social revolution into a democratic party of social reforms. Bernstein has surrounded this political demand with a whole battery of symmetrically arranged "new" arguments and reasonings. The possibility of putting Socialism on a scientific basis and of proving from the point of view of the materialist concep tion of history that it is necessary and inevitable was denied, as was also the growing impoverishment, proletarianization and the intensification of capitalist contradictions. The very conception, "<I>ultimate aim</I>," was declared to be unsound, and the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat was abso-

<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
* Incidentally, this perhaps is the only occasion in the history of modern Socialism in which controversies between various trends within the socialist movement have grown from national into international controversies; and this, in its own way, is extremely encouraging. Formerly, the disputes between the Lassalleans and the Eisenachers,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n7">7</A>]</FONT> between the Guesdites and the Possibilists,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n8">8</A>]</FONT> between the Fabians<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n9">9</A>]</FONT> and the Social-Democrats, and between the Narodnaya Volya-ites<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n10">10</A>]</FONT> and Social-Democrats, remained purely national disputes, reflected purely national features and proceeded, as it were, on different planes. At the present time (this is quite evident now), the English Fabians, the French Ministerialists, the German Bernsteinians and the Russian critics -- all belong to the same family, all extol each other, learn from each other, and together come out against "dogmatic" Marxism. Perhaps in this first really international battle with socialist opportunism, international revolutionary Social-Democracy will become sufficiently strengthened to put an end to the political reaction that has long reigned in Europe?

lutely rejected. It was denied that there is any counter-distinction in principle between liberalism and Socialism. <I>The theory of the class struggle</I> was rejected on the grounds that it could not be applied to a strictly democratic society, governed according to the will of the majority, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus, the demand for a resolute turn from revolutionary Social-Democracy to bourgeois social-reformism was accompanied by a no less resolute turn towards bourgeois criticism of all the fundamental ideas of Marxism. As this criticism of Marxism has been going on for a long time now, from the political platform, from university chairs, in numerous pamphlets and in a number of learned treatises, as <A NAME="p8"> the entire younger generation of the educated classes has been systematically trained for decades on this criticism, it is not surprising that the "new, critical" trend in Social-Democracy should spring up, all complete, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n11">11</A>]</FONT> The content of this new trend did not have to grow and take shape, it was transferred bodily from bourgeois literature to socialist literature. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To proceed. If Bernstein's theoretical criticism and political yearnings are still unclear to anyone, the French have taken the trouble graphically to demonstrate the "new method." In this instance, too, France has justified its old reputation of being the country in which "more than anywhere else, the historical class struggles were each time fought out to a decision. . . ." (Engels, in his introduction<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n12">12</A>]</FONT> to Marx's <I>The Eighteenth Brumaire</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n13">13</A>]</FONT>) The French Socialists have begun, not to theorize, but to act. The democratically more highly developed political conditions in France have permitted them to put "Bernsteinism into practice" immediately, with all its consequences. Millerand has provided an excellent example of practical Bernsteinism; not without reason 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 9</B></FONT><P>

did Bernstein and Vollmar rush so zealously to defend and praise him I Indeed, if Social-Democracy, in essence, is merely a party of reform, and must be bold enough to admit this openly, then not only has a Socialist the right to join a bourgeois cabinet, but must always strive to do so. If democracy, in essence, means the abolition of class domination, then why should not a Socialist minister charm the whole bourgeois world by orations on class collaboration? Why should he not remain in the cabinet even after the shooting down of workers by gendarmes has exposed, for the hundredth and thousandth time, the real nature of the democratic collaboration of classes? Why should he not personally take part in greeting the tsar, for whom the French Socialists now have no other name than hero of the gallows, knout and exile (knouteur, pendeur et d&eacuteportateur)? And the reward for this utter humiliation and self-degradation of Socialism in the face of the whole world, for the corruption of the socialist consciousness of the worker masses -- the only basis that can guarantee our victory -- the reward for this is pompous plans for niggardly reforms, so niggardly in fact that much more has been obtained from bourgeois governments! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He who does not deliberately close his eyes cannot fail to see that the new "critical" trend in Socialism is nothing more nor less than a new variety of <I>opportunism</I>. And if we judge people not by the brilliant uniforms they don, not by the high-sounding appellations they give themselves, but by their actions, and by what they actually advocate, it will be clear that "freedom of criticism" means freedom for an opportunistic trend in Social-Democracy, the freedom to convert Social-Democracy into a democratic party of reform, the freedom to introduce bourgeois ideas and bourgeois elements into Socialism.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "Freedom" is a grand word, but under the banner of free trade the most predatory wars were conducted; under the banner of free labour, the toilers were robbed. The modern use of the term "freedom of criticism" contains the same inherent falsehood. Those who are really convinced that they have advanced science would demand, not freedom for the new views to continue side by side with the old, but the substitution of the new views for the old. The cry "Long live freedom criticism," that is heard today, too strongly calls to mind the fable of the empty barrel.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n14">14</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are marching in a compact group along a precipitous and difficult path, firmly holding each other by the hand. We are surrounded on all sides by enemies, and we have to advance under their almost constant fire. We have combined voluntarily, precisely for the purpose of fighting the enemy, and not to retreat into the adjacent marsh, the inhabitants of which, from the very outset, have reproached us with having separated ourselves into an exclusive group and with having chosen the path of struggle instead of the path of conciliation. And now several among us begin to cry out: let us go into this marsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort: how conservative you are! Are you not ashamed to deny us the liberty to invite you to take a better road! Oh, yes, gentlemen! You are free not only to invite us, but to go yourselves wherever you will, even into the marsh. In fact, we think that the marsh is your proper place, and we are prepared to render you every assistance to get there. Only let go of our hands, don't clutch at us and don't besmirch the grand word "freedom," for we too are "free" to go where we please, free to fight not only against the marsh, but also against those who are turning towards the marsh!

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p11">
   Now, this slogan ("freedom of criticism") has been solemnly advanced, very recently, in No. 10 of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, the organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n15">15</A>]</FONT> not as a theoretical postulate, but as a political demand, as a reply to the question: "is it possible to unite the Social-Democratic organizations operating abroad?" -- "in order that unity may be durable, there must be freedom of criticism." (P. 36.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    From this statement two quite definite conclusions follow: 1) that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> has taken under its wing the opportunist trend in international Social-Democracy in general, and 2) that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> demands freedom for opportunism in Russian Social-Democracy. Let us examine these concluslons.

    The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> is "particularly" displeased with the <I>Iskra's</I> and the <I>Zarya</I>'s<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n16">16</A>]</FONT> "inclination to predict a rupture between the Mountain and the Gironde in international Social-Democracy."*

* A comparison between the two trends among the revolutionary proletariat (the revolutionary and the opportunist), and the two trends among the revolutionary bourgeoisie in the eighteenth century (the Jacobin, known as the Mountain, and the Girondist) was made in a leading article in No. 2 of the <I>Iskra</I> (February 1901). This article was written by Plekhanov. The Cadets,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n17">17</A>]</FONT> the <I>Bezzaglavtsi</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n18">18</A>]</FONT> and the Mensheviks to this day love to refer to the Jacobinism in Russian Social-Democracy but they prefer to remain silent about, or . . . to forget the circumstance that Plekhanov used this term for the first time against the Right wing of Social-Democracy.

the ranks of Social-Democracy represents a shallow historical analogy, a strange thing to come from the pen of a Marxist. The Mountain and the Gironde did not represent different temperaments, or intellectual trends, as ideologist historians may think, but different classes or strata -- the middle bourgeoisie, on the one hand, and the petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat, on the other. In the modern socialist movement, however, there is no conflict of class interests; the socialist movement in its entirety, <I>all</I> of its diverse forms," (B. K.'s italics) "including the most pronounced Bernsteinians, stand on the basis of the class interests of the proletariat and of its class struggle for political and economic emancipation." (Pp. 32-33.)

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  A bold assertion! Has not B. Krichevsky heard of the fact, long ago noted, that it is precisely the extensive participation of an "academic" <I>stratum</I> in the socialist movement in recent years that has secured such a rapid spread of Bernsteinism? And what is most important -- on what does our author base his opinion that even "the most pronounced Bernsteinians" stand on the basis of the class struggle for the political and economic emancipation of the proletariat? No one knows. This determined defence of the most pronounced Bernsteinians is not supported by any argument or ideas whatever. Apparently, the author believes that if he repeats what the most pronounced Bernsteinians say about themselves, his assertion requires no proof. But can anything more "shallow" be imagined than this opinion of a whole tendency based on nothing more than what the representatives of that tendency say about themselves? Can anything more shallow be imagined than the subsequent "homily" about the two different and even diametrically opposite types, or paths, of party development? (<I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, pp. 34-35.) The German Social-Democrats, you see, recognize complete freedom of criticism, but the French do not, and it is precisely their example that demonstrates all the "harmfulness of intolerance."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To which we reply that the very example of B. Krichevsky proves that the name of Marxists is sometimes assumed by people who regard history literally from the ''Ilovaisky''<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n19">19</A>]</FONT> point of view. To explain the unity of the German Socialist Party and the disunity of the French Socialist Party, there is no need whatever to go into the special features in the history of these countries, to contrast the conditions of military semiabsolutism in the one country with republican parliamentarism in the other, or to analyze the effects of the Paris Commune and the effects of the Anti-Socialist Law;<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n21">20</A>]</FONT> to compare the economic life and economic development of the two countries, or recall that "the unexampled growth of German Social-Democracy" was accompanied by a <A NAME="p13a"> strenuous struggle, unexampled in the history of Socialism, not only against mistaken theories (Muhlberger, Duhring,* the Katheder-Socialists<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n22">22</A>]</FONT>), but also against mistaken tactics (Lassalle), etc., etc. All that is superfluous! The French quarrel among themselves because they are intolerant; the Germans are united because they are good boys. 
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
* At the time Engels dealt his blows at Duhring, many representatives of German Social-Democracy inclined towards the latter's views, and accusations of acerbity, intolerance, uncomradely polemics, etc., were even publicly hurled at Engels at the Party Congress. At the Congress of 1877, Most, and his supporters, moved a resolution to prohibit the publication of Engels' articles in the <I>Vorw&aumlrts</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n21">21</A>]</FONT> because "they do not interest the overwhelming majority of the readers," and Wahlteich declared that the publication of these articles had caused great damage to the Party, that Duhring too had rendered services to Social-Democracy: "We must utilize everyone in the interest of the party; let the professors engage in polemics if they care to do so, but the <I>Vorw&aumlrts</I> is not the place in which to conduct them." (<I>Vorw&aumlrts</I>, No. 65, June 6, 1877.) This, as you see, is another example of the defence of "freedom of criticism," and our legal critics and illegal opportunists, who love so much to cite the example of the Germans, would do well to ponder over it! 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 14</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  And observe, this piece of matchless profundity is intended to "refute" the fact which is a complete answer to the defence of the Bernsteinians. The question as to whether the Bernsteinians <I>do stand</I> on the basis of the class struggle of the proletariat can be completely and irrevocably answered only by historical experience. Consequently, the example of France is the most important one in this respect, because it is the only country in which the <A NAME="p14"> Bernsteinians attempted to stand independently, on their own feet, with the warm approval of their German colleagues (and partly also of the Russian opportunists; cf. the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 2-3, pp. 83-84). The reference to the "intolerance" of the French, apart from its "historical" significance (in the Nozdryov sense<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n23">23</A>]</FONT>), turns out to be merely an attempt to obscure very unpleasant facts with angry invectives. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Nor are we at all prepared to make a present of the Germans to B. Krichevsky and to the numerous other champions of "freedom of criticism." If the "most pronounced Bernsteinians" are still tolerated in the ranks of the German party, it is only to the extent that they <I>submit</I> to the Hanover resolution,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n24">24</A>]</FONT> which emphatically rejected Bernstein's "amendments," and to the Lubeck resolution,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n25">25</A>]</FONT> which (notwithstanding the diplomatic terms in which it is couched) contains a direct warning to Bernstein. It is debatable, from the standpoint of the interests of the German party, whether diplomacy was appropriate and whether, in this case, a bad peace is better than a good quarrel; in short, opinions may differ as to the expediency of one or another </I>method</I> employed to reject Bernsteinism, but that the German party <I>did reject</I> Bernsteinism on two occasions is a fact no one can fail to see. Therefore, to think that the German example confirms the thesis: "The most pronounced Bernsteinians stand 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 15</B></FONT><P>

on the basis of the class struggle of the proletariat, for political and economic emancipation," means failing absolutely to understand what is going on before everybody's eyes.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np15">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Nor is that all. As we have already observed, the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> demands "freedom of criticism," and defends Bernsteinism before <I>Russian</I> Social-Democracy. Apparently it came to the conclusion that we were unfair to our "critics" and the Bernsteinians. Which ones? Who was unfair? Where and when? What was the unfairness? About this not a word. The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> does not name a single Russian critic or Bernsteinian! All that is left for us to do is to make one of two possible suppositions: <I>Either</I>, that the unfairly treated party is none other than the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> itself (and this is confirmed by the fact that in the two articles in No. 10 reference is made only to the wrongs suffered by the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> at the hands of the <I>Zarya</I> 

<A NAME="np15">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
* It should be observed that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> has always confined itself to a bare statement of facts concerning Bernsteinism in the German party, and completely "refrained" from expressing its own opinion on these facts. See, for example, the reports of the Stuttgart Congress<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n26">26</A>]</FONT> in No. 2-3 (p. 66), in which all the disagreements are reduced to disagreements over "tactics," and the bare statement is made that the overwhelming majority remain true to the previous revolutionary tactics. Or take No. 4-5 (p. 25 et seq.), in which we have a bare paraphrasing of the speeches delivered at the Hanover Congress, and a reprint of the resolution moved by Bebel. An exposition and criticism of Bernstein's views is again put off (as was the case in No. 2-3) to be dealt with in a "special article." Curiously enough, in No. 4-5 (p. 33), we read the following: ". . . the views expounded by Bebel have the support of the enormous majority of the congress," and a few lines lower: ". . . David defended Bernstein's views. . . . First of all, he tried to show that . . . Bernstein and his friends, after all is said and done," (<I>sic!</I>) stand on the basis of the class struggle. . . ." This was written in December 1899, and in September 1901 the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, apparently having lost faith in the correctness of Bebel's position, repeats David's views as its own! 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 16</B></FONT><P>

and the <I>Iskra</I>). If that is the case, how is the strange fact to be explained that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, which always vehemently dissociates itself from all solidarity with Bernsteinism, could not defend itself, without putting in a word on behalf of the "most pronounced Bernsteinians" and of freedom of criticism? Or some third persons have been treated unfairly. If this is the case, then what reasons may there be for not naming them? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp  <A NAME="p16">
   We see, therefore, that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> is continuing to play the game of hide-and-seek that it has played (as we shall show further on) ever since it commenced publication. And note this <I>first</I> practical application of the much vaunted "freedom of criticism." As a matter of fact, not only was it forthwith reduced to abstention from all criticism, but also to abstention from expressing independent views altogether. The very <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> which avoids mentioning Russian Bernsteinism as if it were a shameful disease (to use Starover's<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n27">27</A>]</FONT> apt expression) proposes, for the treatment of this disease, to <I>copy word for word</I> the latest German prescription for the treatment of the German variety of the disease! Instead of freedom of criticism -- slavish (worse: monkeylike) imitation. The very same social and political content of modern international opportunism reveals itself in a variety of ways according to its national peculiarities. In one country the opportunists long ago came out under a separate flag, in another they ignored theory and in practice pursued the policy of the Radical-Socialists; in a third country, several members of the revolutionary party have deserted to the camp of opportunism and strive to achieve their aims not by an open struggle for principles and for new tactics, but by gradual, imperceptible and, if one may so express it, unpunishable corruption of their party. In a 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 17</B></FONT><P>

fourth country again, similar deserters employ the same methods in the gloom of political slavery, and with an absolutely unique combination of "legal" with "illegal" activity, etc., etc. To talk about freedom of criticism and Bernsteinism as a condition for uniting the <I>Russian</I> Social-Democrats, and not to explain how <I>Russian</I> Bernsteinism has manifested itself, and what particular fruits it has borne, is tantamount to talking for the purpose of saying nothing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us ourselves try, if only in a few words, to say what the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> did not want to say (or perhaps did not even understand).

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The chief distinguishing feature of Russia in regard to the point we are examining is that <I>the very beginning</I> of the spontaneous working-class movement, on the one hand, and the change of progressive public opinion towards Marxism on the other, was marked by the combination of obviously heterogeneous elements under a common flag for the purpose also of fighting a common enemy (an obsolete social and political world outlook). We refer to the heyday of "legal Marxism." Speaking generally, this was an altogether curious phenomenon that no one in the 'eighties or the beginning of the 'nineties would have believed possible. In a country ruled by an autocracy, in which the press is completely shackled, and in a period of terrific political reaction in which even the tiniest outgrowth of political discontent and protest was persecuted, the theory of revolutionary Marxism suddenly forces its way into the <I>censored</I> literature, and though expounded in Aesopian language, is 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 18</B></FONT><P>

understood by the "interested." The government had accus tomed itself to regarding only the theory of (revolutionary) Narodnaya Volya-ism as dangerous, without, as is usually the case, observing its internal evolution, and rejoicing at any criticism levelled against it. Quite a considerable time elapsed (according to our Russian calculations) before the government realized what had happened and the unwieldy army of censors and gendarmes discovered the new enemy and flung itself upon him. <A NAME="p18"> Meanwhile, Marxist books were published one after another, Marxist journals and newspapers were founded, nearly everyone became a Marxist, Marxists were flattered, Marxists were courted and the book publishers rejoiced at the extraordinary, ready sale of Marxist literature. It was quite natural, therefore, that among the Marxist novices who were caught in this atmosphere, there should be more than one "author who got a swelled head. . . ."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n28">28</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    We can now speak calmly of this period as of an event of the past. It is no secret that the brief period in which Marxism blossomed on the surface of our literature was called forth by an alliance between people of extreme and of very moderate views. In point of fact, the latter were bourgeois democrats; and this was the conclusion (so strik ingly confirmed by their subsequent "critical" development) that suggested itself to some people even when the "alliance" was still intact.*

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    That being the case, does not the responsibility for the subsequent "confusion" rest mainly upon the revolutionary

Social-Democrats who entered into the alliance with the future "critics"? This question, together with a reply in the affirmative, is sometimes heard from people with excessively rigid views. But these people are absolutely wrong. Only those who are not sure of themselves can fear to enter into temporary alliances even with unreliable people; not a single political party could exist without such alliances. The combination with the "legal Marxists" was in its way the first really political alliance entered into by Russian Social-Democrats. Thanks to this alliance, an astonishingly rapid victory was obtained over Narodism, and Marxist ideas (even though in a vulgarized form) became very widespread. More over, the alliance was not concluded altogether without "conditions." The proof: the burning by the censor, in 1895, of the Marxist symposium, <I>Materials on the Problem of the Economic Development of Russia</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n29">29</A>]</FONT> If the literary agreement with the "legal Marxists" can be compared with a political alliance, then that book can be compared with a political treaty. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The rupture, of course, did not occur because the "allies" proved to be bourgeois democrats. On the contrary, the representatives of the latter trend are natural and desirable allies of Social-Democracy in so far as its democratic tasks, brought to the front by the prevailing situation in Russia, are concerned. But an essential condition for such an alliance must be the full opportunity for the Socialists to reveal to the working class that its interests are diametrically opposed to the interests of the bourgeoisie. However, the Bernsteinian and "critical" trend, to which the majority of the "legal Marxists" turned, deprived the Socialists of this opportunity and corrupted socialist consciousness by vulgarizing Marxism, by advocating the theory that social antag-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 20</B></FONT><P>

onisms were being toned down, by declaring the idea of the social revolution and of the dictatorship of the proletariat to be absurd, by reducing the working-class movement and the class struggle to narrow trade unionism and to a "realistic" struggle for petty, gradual reforms. This was tantamount to bourgeois democracy denying Socialism's right to independence and, consequently, of its right to existence; in practice it meant a striving to convert the nascent working-class movement into an appendage of the liberals. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Naturally, under such circumstances a rupture was necessary. But the "peculiar" feature of Russia manifested itself in that this rupture simply meant the elimination of the Social-Democrats from the most accessible and widespread "legal" literature. The "ex-Marxists" who took up the flag of "criticism," and who obtained almost a monopoly of "demolishing"  <A NAME="p20">Marxism, entrenched themselves in this literature. Catchwords like: "Against orthodoxy" and "Long live freedom of criticism" (now repeated by the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo </I>) immediately became the fashion, and the fact that neither the censor nor the gendarmes could resist this fashion is apparent from the publication of <I>three</I> Russian editions of Bernstein's celebrated book (celebrated in the Herostratus sense)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n30">30</A>]</FONT> and from the fact that the books by Bernstein, Mr. Prokopovich and others were recommended by Zubatov.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n31">31</A>]</FONT> (<I>Iskra</I>, No. 10.) Upon the Social-Democrats was now imposed a task that was difficult in itself, and made incredibly more difficult by purely external obstacles, viz., the task of combating the new trend. And this trend did not confine itself to the sphere of literature. The turn towards "criticism" was accompanied by the inclination towards "Economism" among Social-Democratic practical workers. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 21</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The manner in which the connection between, and inter-dependence of, legal criticism and illegal Economism arose and grew is an interesting subject in itself, and could serve as the subject of a special article. We need only note here that this connection undoubtedly existed. The notoriety deservedly acquired by the <I>Credo</I> was due precisely to the frankness with which it formulated this connection and blurted out the fundamental political tendency of "Economism," viz., let the workers carry on the economic struggle (it wouid be more correct to say the trade-unionist struggle, because the later also embraces specifically working-class politics), and let the Marxist intelligentsia merge with the liberals for the political "struggle." Thus, trade-unionist work "among the people" meant fuifilling the first part of this task, and legal criticism meant fuifilling the second part. This statement was such an excellent weapon against Economism that, had there been no <I>Credo</I>, it would have been worth inventing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The <I>Credo</I> was not invented, but it was published without the consent and perhaps even against the will of its authors. At all events the present writer, who took part in dragging this new "program" into the light of day,* has heard complaints and reproaches to the effect that copies of the r&eacutesum&eacute of the speakers were distributed, dubbed the <I>Credo</I>, and even published in the press together with the protest! We refer to this episode because it reveals a very peculiar feature of

* Reference is to the Protest of the Seventeen<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n32">32</A>]</FONT> against the <I>Credo</I>. The present writer took part in drawing up this protest (the end of 1899). The protest and the <I>Credo</I> were published abroad in the spring of 1900. (See Lenin, <I>Collected Works</I>, 4th Russ. ed., Vol. IV, pp. 149-63. --<I>Ed.</I>) It is now known from the article written by Madame Kuskova, I think in <I>Byloye</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n33">33</A>]</FONT> that she was the author of the <I>Credo</I>, and that Mr. Prokopovich was very prominent among the "Economists" abroad at that time. (Author's note to the 1907 edition. --<I>Ed.</I>) 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 22</B></FONT><P> <A NAME="p22">

our Economists, viz., a fear of publicity. This is a feature of Economism generally, and not of the authors of the <I>Credo</I> alone. It was revealed by that most outspoken and honest advocate of Economism, the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n34">34</A>]</FONT> and by the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> (which was indignant over the publication of "Economist" documents in the <I>Vademecum</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n35">35</A>]</FONT>), as well as by the Kiev Committee, which two years ago refused to permit the publication of its <I>profession de foi</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n36">36</A>]</FONT> together with a repudiation of it,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np22">*</A>]</FONT> and by many, many other individual representatives of Economism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This fear of criticism being displayed by the advocates of freedom of criticism cannot be attributed solely to craftiness (although, on occasion, no doubt craftiness has something to do with it: it would be unwise to expose the young and as yet frail shoots of the new trend to attacks by opponents). No, the majority of the Economists quite sincerely disapprove (and by the very nature of Economism they must disapprove) of all theoretical controversies, factional disagreements, broad political questions, schemes for organizing revolutionaries, etc. "Leave all that to the people abroad!" said a fairly consistent Economist to me one day, and thereby he expressed a very widespread (and again a purely trade-unionist) view: our work, he said, is the working-class movement, the workers' organizations, here, in our parts; all the rest are merely the inventions of doctrinaires, an "exaggeration of the importace of ideology," as the authors of the letter, published in the <I>Iskra</I>, No. 12, expressed it, in unison with the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 10. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The question now arises: such being the peculiar features of Russian "criticism" and Russian Bernsteinism, what should

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 23</B></FONT><P>

have been the task of those who desired to oppose opportunism, in deeds and not merely in words? First of all, they should have made efforts to resume the theoretical work that the period of "legal Marxism" had only just begun, and that has now again fallen on the shoulders of the illegal workers. Without such work the successful growth of the movement was impossible. Secondly, they should have actively combated legal "criticism" that was greatly corrupting people's minds. Thirdly, they should have actively opposed confusion and vacillation in the practical movement, exposing and repudiating every conscious or unconscious attempt to degrade our program and tactics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    That the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> did none of these things is well known, and further on we shall deal in detail with this well-known fact from various aspects. At the moment, however, we desire merely to show what a glaring contradiction there is between the demand for "freedom of criticism" and the specific features of our native criticism and Russian Economism. Indeed, glance at the text of the resolution in which the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad endorsed the point of view of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
<FONT SIZE=-1>
   "In the interests of the further ideological development of Social-Democracy, we recognize the freedom to criticize Social-Democratic theory in Party literature to be absolutely necessary in so far as this criticism does not run counter to the class and revolutionary character of this theory." (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 10.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And the argumentation? The resolution "in its first part coincides with the resolution of the L&uumlbeck Party Congress on Bernstein. . . . " In the simplicity of their souls the "Unionists" failed to observe what a <I>testimonium paupertatis</I> (certificate of poverty) they give themselves by this piece of imitativeness. . . . "But . . . in its second part, it restricts 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 24</B></FONT><P>

freedom of criticism much more than did the L&uumlbeck Party Congress." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   So the Union's resolution was directed against the Russian Bernsteinians? If it was not, then the reference to L&uumlbeck would be utterly absurd! But it is not true to say that it "restricts freedom of criticism." In passing their Hanover resolution, the Germans, point by point, rejected <I>precisely</I> the amendments proposed by Bernstein, while in their L&uumlbeck resolution they cautioned <I>Bernstein personally</I>, by naming him in the resolution. Our "free" imitators, however, do not make a single allusion to a single manifestation of Russian "criticism" and Russian Economism and, in view of this omission, the bare reference to the class and revolutionary character of the theory leaves far wider scope for misinter pretation, particularly when the Union refuses to identify "so-called Economism" with opportunism. (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 8, par. I.) But all this en passant. The main thing to note is that the opportunist attitude towards revolutionary Social-Democrats in Russia is the very opposite of that in Germany. In that country, as we know, revolutionary Social-Democrats are in favour of preserving what is: the old program and tactics which are universally known, and have been elucidated in all their details by many decades of experience. The "critics" want to introduce changes, and as these critics represent an insignificant minority, and as they are very timid in their revisionist efforts, one can understand the motives of the majority in confining themselves to the dry rejection of "innovations." In Russia, however, it is the critics and Economists who are in favour of preserving what is: the "critics" want us to continue to regard them as Marxists, and to guarantee them the "freedom of criticism" which they enjoyed to the full (for, as a matter of fact, they 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 25</B></FONT><P>

(Special Supplement to the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n37">37</A>]</FONT> p. 14.)

* The very absence of public Party ties and Party traditions marks such a cardinal difference between Russia and Germany that it should have warned all sensible Socialists against blind imitation. But here is an example of the lengths to which "freedom of criticism" goes in Russia. Mr. Bulgakov, the Russian critic, utters the following reprimand to the Austrian critic, Hertz: "Notwithstanding the independence of his conclusions, Hertz, on this point" (on cooperative societies) "apparently remains excessively tied by the opinions of his Party, and although he disagrees with it in details, he dare not reject the common principle." (<I>Capitalism and Agriculture</I>, Vol. II, p. 287.) The subject of a politically enslaved state, in which nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand of the population are corrupted to the marrow of their bones by political subservience, and completely lack the conception of Party honour and Party ties, superciliously reprimands a citizen of a constitutional state for being excessively "tied by the opinion of his Party"! Our illegal organizations have nothing else to do, of course, but draw up resolutions about freedom of criticism. . . .

                                       THEORETICAL STRUGGLE
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "Dogmatism, doctrinairism," "ossification of the Party -- the inevitable retribution that follows the violent strait-lacing of thought" -- these are the enemies against which the knightly champions of "freedom of criticism" in the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> rise up in arms. We are very glad that this question has been placed on the order of the day and we would only propose to add to it another question: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Who are the judges? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p26a">
   Before us lie two publisher's announcements. One, <I>The Program of the Periodical Organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats</I> -- <I>the</I> "<I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>" (reprint from No. 1 of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>), and the other an announcement of the resumption of the publications of the Emancipation of Labour group.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n39">39</A>]</FONT> Both are dated 1899, a time when the "crisis of Marxism" had long since been under discussion. And what do we find? You would seek in vain in the first announcement for any reference to this phenomenon, or a definite statement of the position the new organ intends to adopt on this question. Of theoretical work and the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 27</B></FONT><P>

urgent tasks that now confront it not a word is said, either in this program or in the supplements to it that were adopted by the Third Congress of the Union in 1901 (<I>Two Congresses</I>, pp. 15-18). During the whole of this time the editorial board of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> ignored theoretical questions, in spite of the fact that these questions were agitating the minds of all Social-Democrats all over the world. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The other announcement, on the contrary, points first of all to the decreased interest in theory observed in recent years, imperatively demands "vigilant attention to the theoretical aspect of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat," and calls for "ruthless criticism of the Bernsteinian and other antirevolutionary tendencies" in our movement. The issues of the <I>Zarya</I> that have appeared show how this program has been carried out. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus we see that high-sounding phrases against the ossification of thought, etc., conceal unconcern for and impotence in the development of theoretical thought. The case of the Russian Social-Democrats very strikingly illustrates the phenomenon observed in the whole of Europe (and long ago noted also by the German Marxists) that the celebrated freedom! of criticism does not imply the substitution of one theory for a other, but freedom from all integral and considered theory; it implies eclecticism and lack of principle. Those who have the slightest acquaintance with the actual state of our movement cannot but see that the wide spread of Marxism was accompanied by a certain lowering of the theoretical level. Quite a number of people with very little, and even a total lack of theoretical training joined the movement because of its practical significance and its practical successes. We can judge from that how tactless the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> is when, with an air of triumph, it quotes Marx's statement: "Every 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 28</B></FONT><P> <A NAME="p28">

step of real movement is more important than a dozen programs."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n40">40</A>]</FONT> To repeat these words in a period of theoretical chaos is like wishing mourners at a funeral "many happy returns of the day." Moreover, these words of Marx are taken from his letter on the Gotha Program, in which he <I>sharply condemns</I> eclecticism in the formulation of principles: If you must unite, Marx wrote to the party leaders, then enter into agreements to satisfy the practical aims of the movement, but do not allow any bargaining over principle, do not make "concessions" in questions of theory. This was Marx's idea, and yet there are people among us who strive -- in his name -- to belittle the significance of theory! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Without a reolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement. This thought cannot be insisted upon too strongly at a time when the fashionable preaching of opportunism goes hand in hand with an infatuation for the narrowest forms of practical activity. Yet, for Russian Social-Democrats the importance of theory is enhanced by three more circumstances, which are often forgotten: firstly, by the fact that our Party is only in process of formation, its features are only just becoming outlined, and it is yet far from having settled accounts with other trends of revolutionary thought, which threaten to divert the movement from the correct path. On the contrary, precisely the very recent past was marked by a revival of non-Social-Democratic revolutionary trends (which Axelrod long ago warned the Economists would happen). Under these circumstances, what at first sight appears to be an "unimportant" mistake may lead to most deplorable consequences, and only shortsighted people can consider factional disputes and a strict differentiation between shades inopportune or superfluous. The fate of Russian 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 29</B></FONT><P>

Social-Democracy for many, many years to come may depend on the strengthening of one or other "shade." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Secondly, the Social-Democratic movement is in its very essence an international movement. This means not only that we must combat national chauvinism, but also that a movement that is starting in a young country can be successful only if it implements the experience of other countries. And in order to implement this experience, it is not enough merely to be acquainted with it, or simply to transcribe the latest resolutions. What it requires is the ability to treat this experience critically and to test it independently. Anybody who realizes how enormously the modern working-class movement has grown and branched out will understand what a reserve of theoretical forces and political (as well as revolutionary) experience is required to fulfil this task. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thirdly, the national tasks of Russian Social-Democracy are such as have never confronted any other socialist party in the world. Further on we shall have occasion to deal with the political and organizational duties which the task of emancipating the whole people from the yoke of autocracy imposes upon us. At this point, we only wish to state that the <I>role of vanguard fighter can be fulfilled only by a party that is guided by the most advanced theory</I>. In order to get some concrete understanding of what this means, let the reader recall such predecessors of Russian Social-Democracy as Herzen, Belinsky, Chernyshevsky and the brilliant galaxy of revolutionaries of the 'seventies; let him ponder over the world significance which Russian literature is now acquiring; let him . . . but that is enough! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us quote what Engels said in 1874 concerning the significance of theory in the Social-Democratic movement. Engels recognizes not two forms of the great struggle of Social-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page30 </B></FONT><P> <A NAME="p30">

Democracy (political and economic), as is the fashion among us, <I>but three, placing on a par with the first two the theoretical struggle</I>. His recommendations to the German working class movement, which had become strong, practically and politically, are so instructive from the standpoint of present day problems and controversies, that we hope the reader will not be vexed with us for quoting a long passage from his prefatory note to <I>Der deutsche Bauernkrieg</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n41">41</A>]</FONT> which has long become a great bibliographical rarity. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The German workers have two important advantages over those of the rest of Europe. First, they belong to the most theoretical people of Europe; and they have retained that sense of theory which the so-called 'educated' classes of Germany have almost completely lost. Without German philosophy which preceded it, particularly that of Hegel, German scientific Socialism -- the only scientific Socialism that has ever existed -- would never have come into being. Without a sense of theory among the workers, this scientific Socialism would never have entered their flesh and blood as much as is the case. What an immeasurable advantage this is may be seen, on the one hand, from the indifference towards all theory, which is one of the main reasons why the English working-class movement crawls along so slowly in spite of the splendid organization of the individual unions; on the other hand, from the mischief and confusion wrought by Proudhonism, in its original form, among the French and Belgians, and, in the form further caricatured by Bakunin, among the Spaniards and Italians. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The second advantage is that, chronologically speaking, the Germans were about the last to come into the workers' movement. Just as German theoretical Socialism will never forget that it rests on the shoulders of Saint-Simon, Fourier 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 31</B></FONT><P>

and Owen -- three men who, in spite of all their fantastic notions and all their utopianism, have their place among the most eminent thinkers of all times, and whose genius anticipated innumerable things the correctness of which is now being scientifically proved by us -- so the practical workers' movement in Germany ought never to forget that it has developed on the shoulders of the English and French movements, that it was able simply to utilize their dearly-bought experience, and could now avoid their mistakes, which in their time were mostly unavoidable. Without the precedent of the English trade unions and French workers' political struggles, without the gigantic impulse given especially by the Paris Commune, where would we be now? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It must be said to the credit of the German workers that they have used the advantages of their situation with rare understanding. For the first time since the working-class movement has existed, the struggle is being waged in a planned way from its three coordinated and interconnected sides, the theoretical, the political and the practical-economic (resistance to the capitalists). It is precisely in this, as it were, concentric attack, that the strength and invincibility of the German movement lies. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Due to this advantageous situation, on the one hand, and to the insular peculiarities of the English and the forcible suppression of the French movement, on the other, the German workers have for the moment been placed in the vanguard of the proletarian struggle. How long events will allow them to occupy this post of honour cannot be foretold. But let us hope that as long as they occupy it, they will fill it fittingly. This demands redoubled efforts in every field of struggle and agitation. In particular, it will be the duty of the leaders to gain an ever clearer insight into all the-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 32</B></FONT><P>

oretical questions, to free themselves more and more from the influence of traditional phrases inherited from the old world outlook, and constantly to keep in mind that Socialism, since it has become a science, demands that it be pursued as a science, i.e., that it be studied. The task will be to spread with increased zeal among the masses of the workers the ever more clarified understanding thus acquired, to knit together ever more firmly the organization both of the party and of the trade unions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p32">
   " . . . If the German workers proceed in this way, they will not be marching exactly at the head of the movement -- it is not at all in the interest of this movement that the workers of any particular country should march at its head -- but will, nevertheless, occupy an honourable place in the battle line; and they will stand armed for battle when either unexpectedly grave trials or momentous events demand of them increased courage, increased determination and energy.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n42">42</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Engels' words proved prophetic. Within a few years the German workers were subjected to unexpectedly grave trials in the shape of the Anti-Socialist Law. And the German workers really met them armed for battle and succeeded in emerging from them victoriously. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Russian proletariat will have to undergo trials immeasurably more grave; it will have to fight a monster compared with which the Anti-Socialist Law in a constitutional country seems but a pigmy. History has now confronted us with an immediate task which is the <I>most revolutionary</I> of all the <I>immediate</I> tasks that confront the proletariat of any country. The fulfilment of this task, the destruction of the most powerful bulwark, not only of European, but also (it may now be said) of Asiatic reaction, would make the Russian 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 33</B></FONT><P>

proletariat the vanguard of the international revolutionary proletariat. And we have the right to count upon acquiring this honourable title already earned by our predecessors, the revolutionaries of the 'seventies, if we succeed in inspiring our movement -- which is a thousand times broader and deeper -- with the same devoted determination and vigour.

  We have said that our movement, much wider and deeper than the movement of the 'seventies, must be inspired with the same devoted determination and vigour that inspired the movement at that time. Indeed, no one, we think, has up to now doubted that the strength of the present-day movement lies in the awakening of the masses (principally, the industrial proletariat), and that its weakness lies in the lack of consciousness and initiative among the revolutionary leaders. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   However, of late a most astonishing discovery has been made, which threatens to overthrow all the views that had hitherto prevailed on this question. This discovery was made by the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, which in its controversy with the <I>Iskra</I> and the <I>Zarya</I> did not confine itself to making objections on separate points, but tried to ascribe "general disagreements" to a more profound cause -- to the "different appraisals of the relative importance of the spontaneous and consciously 'methodical' element." The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 35</B></FONT><P>

formulated its indictment as a <I>belittling of the significance of the objective or the spontaneous element of development</I>."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np35">*</A>]</FONT> To this we say: if the controversy with the <I>Iskra</I> and the <I>Zarya</I> resulted in nothing more than causing the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> to hit upon these "general disagreements," that result alone would give us considerble satisfaction, so significant is this thesis and so clearly does it illuminate the quintessence of the present-day theoretical and political differences that exist among Russian Social-Democrats.  

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   That is why the question of the relation between consciousness and spontaneity is of such enormous general interest, and that is why this question must be dealt with in great detail.

   In the previous chapter we pointed out how <I>universally</I> absorbed the educated youth of Russia was in the theories of Marxism in the middle of the 'nineties. The strikes that followed the famous St. Petersburg industrial war of 1896 assumed a similar wholesale character. The fact that these strikes spread over the whole of Russia clearly showed how deep the newly awakening popular movement was, and if we are to speak of the "spontaneous element" then, of course, it is this movement which, first and foremost, must be regarded as spontaneous. But there is spontaneity and spontaneity. Strikes occurred in Russia in the 'seventies and

'sixties (and even in the first half of the nineteenth century), and were accompanied by the "spontaneous" destruction of machinery, etc. Compared with these "riots" the strikes of the 'nineties might even be described as "conscious," to such an extent do they mark the progress which the working-class movement had made in that period. This shows that the "spontaneous element," in essence, represents nothing more nor less than consciousness in an <I>embryonic form</I>. Even the primitive riots expressed the awakening of consciousness to a certain extent: the workers were losing their agelong faith in the permanence of the system which oppressed them. They began . . . I shall not say to understand, but to sense the necessity for collective resistance, and definitely abandoned their slavish submission to their superiors. But this was, nevertheless, more in the nature of outbursts of desperation and vengeance than of <I>struggle</I>. The strikes of the 'nineties revealed far greater flashes of consciousness: definite demands were advanced, the strike was carefully timed, known cases and examples in other places were discussed, etc. While the riots were simply revolts of the oppressed, the systematic strikes represented the class struggle in embryo, but only in embryo. Taken by themselves, these strikes were simply trade union struggles, but not yet Social-Democratic struggles. They testified to the awakening antagonisms between workers and employers, but the workers were not, and could not be, conscious of the irreconcilable antagonism of their interests to the whole of the modern political and social system, i.e., theirs was not yet Social-Democratic consciousness. In this sense, the strikes of the 'nineties, in spite of the enormous progress they represented as compared with the "riots," remained a purely spontaneous movement. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 37</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  We have said that <I>there could not yet be</I> Social-Democratic consciousness among the workers. It could only be brought to them from without. The history of all countries shows that the working class exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers and strive to compel the government to pass necessary labour legislation, etc.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np37">*</A>]</FONT> The theory of Socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical and economic theories that were elaborated by the educated representatives of the propertied classes, the intellectuals. According to their social status, the founders of modern scientific Socialism, Marx and Engels, themselves belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia. In the very same way, in Russia, the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose quite independently of the spontaneous growth of the working-class movement, it arose as a natural and inevitable outcome of the development of ideas among the revolutionary socialist intelligentsia. At the time of which we are speaking, i.e., the middle of the 'nineties, this doctrine not only represented the completely formulated program of the Emancipation of Labour group, but had already won over to its side the majority of the revolutionary youth in Russia. 

<P>&nbsp;  &nbsp;
    Hence, we had both the spontaneous awakening of the masses of the workers, the awakening to conscious life and conscious struggle, and a revolutionary youth, armed with the Social-Democratic theory, eager to come into contact with

the workers. In this connection it is particularly important to state the oft-forgotten (and comparatively little-known) fact that the early Social-Democrats of that period <I>zealously carried on economic agitation</I> (being guided in this by the really useful instructions contained in the pamphlet <I>On Agitation</I> that was still in manuscript), but they did not regard this as their sole task. <A NAME="p38"> On the contrary, <I>right from the very beginning</I> they advanced the widest historical tasks of Russian Social-Democracy in general, and the task of overthrowing the autocracy in particular. For example, already towards the end of 1895, the St. Petersburg group of Social-Democrats, which founded the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n43">43</A>]</FONT> prepared the first issue of a newspaper called the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>. This issue was ready to go to press when it was seized by the gendarmes who, on the night of December 8, 1895, raided the house of one of the members of the group, Anatoli Alexeyevich Vaneyev,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np38">*</A>]</FONT> and so the original <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> was not destined to see the light of day. The leading article in this issue (which perhaps in some thirty years' time some <I>Russkaya Starina</I>"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n44">44</A>]</FONT> will unearth in the archives of the Department of Police) described the historical tasks of the working class in Russia, of which the achievement of political liberty is regarded as the most important. This issue also contained an article entitled "What Are Our Cabinet Ministers Thinking Of?"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n45">45</A>]</FONT> which dealt with the breaking up of the elementary education

committees by the police. In addition, there was some correspondence, not only from St. Petersburg, but from other parts of Russia too (for example, a letter about the assault on the workers in Yaroslavl Gubernia). This, if we are not mistaken, "first effort" of the Russian Social-Democrats of the 'nineties was not a narrow, local, and certainly not an "economic" newspaper, but one that aimed to unite the strike movement with the revolutionary movement against the autocracy, and to win all who were oppressed by the policy of reactionary obscurantism over to the side of Social-Democracy. No one in the slightest degree acquainted with the state of the movement at that period could doubt that such a paper would have met with warm response among the workers of the capital and the revolutionary intelligentsia and would have had a wide circulation. <A NAME="p39"> The failure of the enterprise merely showed that the Social-Democrats of that period were unable to meet the immediate requirements of the time owing to their lack of revolutionary experience and practical training. The same thing must be said with regard to the <I>S. Peterburgsky Rabochy Listok</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n46">46</A>]</FONT> and particularly with regard to the <I>Rabochaya Gazeta</I> and the <I>Manifesto</I> of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party which was founded in the spring of 1898. Of course, we would not dream of blaming the Social-Democrats of that time for this unpreparedness. But in order to profit from the experience of that movement, and to draw practical lessons from it, we must thoroughly understand the causes and significance of this or that shortcoming. For that reason it is extremely important to establish the fact that part (perhaps even a majority) of the Social-Democrats, operating in the period of 1895-98, quite justly considered it possible even then, at the very beginning of the "spontaneous" movement, to 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 40</B></FONT><P>

come forward with a most extensive program and militant tactics.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np">*</A>]</FONT> The lack of training of the majority of the revolutionaries, being quite a natural phenomenon, could not have aroused any particular fears. Since the tasks were correctly defined, since the energy existed for repeated attempts to fulfil these tasks, temporary failures were not such a great misfortune. Revolutionary experience and organizational skill are things that can be acquired provided the desire is there to acquire them, provided the shortcomings are recognized -- which in revolutionary activity is more than halfway towards removing them! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    But what was not a great misfortune became a real misfortune when this consciousness began to grow dim (it was very much alive among the workers of the group mentioned), when people -- and even Social-Democratic organs -- appeared who were prepared to regard shortcomings as virtues, who even tried to invent a <I>theoretical</I> basis for <I>slavish cringing before spontaneity</I>.

  Before dealing with the literary manifestation of this subservience, we should like to note the following characteristic fact (communicated to us from the above-mentioned source), which throws some light on the circumstances in which the two future conflicting trends in Russian Social-Democracy arose and grew among the comrades working in St. Petersburg. In the beginning of 1897, just prior to their banishment, A. A. Vaneyev and several of his comrades attended a private meeting<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n47">47</A>]</FONT> at which "old" and "young" members of the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class gathered. The conversation centred chiefly around the question of organization, and particularly around the "rules for the workers' benefit fund," which, in their final form, were published in the <I>Listok Rabotnika</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n48">48</A>]</FONT> No. 9-10, p. 46. Sharp differences were immediately revealed between the "old" members ("Decembrists," as the St. Petersburg Social-Democrats jestingly called them) and several of the "young" members (who subsequently actively collaborated on the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> ), and a very heated discussion ensued. The "young" members defended the main principles of the rules in the form in which they were published. The "old" members said that the prime necessity was not this, but the consolidation of the League of Struggle into an organization of revolutionaries to which all the various workers' benefit funds, students' propaganda circles, etc., should be subordinated. It

goes without saying that the controversialists had no suspicion at that time that these disagreements were the beginning of a divergence; on the contrary, they regarded them as being of an isolated and casual nature. But this fact shows that in Russia too "Economism" did not arise and spread without a fight against the "old" Social-Democrats (the Economists of today are apt to forget this). And if, in the main, this struggle has not left "documentary" traces behind it, it is solely because the membership of the circles functioning at that time underwent such constant change that no continuity was established and, consequently, differences were not recorded in any documents. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The appearance of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> brought Economisn to the light of day, but not all at once. We must picture to ourselves concretely the conditions of the work and the short-lived character of the majority of the Russian circles (and only those who have experienced this can have any exact idea of it), in order to understand how much there was accidental in the successes and failures of the new trend in various towns, and for how long a time neither the advocates nor the opponents of this "new" trend could make up their minds -- indeed they had no opportunity to do so -- as to whether this was really a distinct trend or whether it was merely an expression of the lack of training of certain individuals.<A NAME="p42"> For example, the first mimeographed copies of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> never reached the great majority of Social-Democrats, and we are able to refer to the leading article in the first number only because it was reproduced in an article by V. I.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n49">49</A>]</FONT> (<I>Listok Rabotnika</I>, No. 9-10, p. 47 et seq.), who, of course, did not fail to extol with more zeal than reason the new paper, which was so different from the papers and the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 43</B></FONT><P>

plans for papers mentioned above.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np43">*</A>]</FONT> And this leading article deserves to be dealt with because it so strongly expresses the <I>spirit</I> of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> and Economism generally. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   After stating that the arm of the "blue-coats"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n50">50</A>]</FONT> could never stop the progress of the working-class movement, the leading article goes on to say: ". . . The virility of the working-class movement is due to the fact that the workers themselves are at last taking their fate into their own hands, and out of the hands of the leaders," and this fundamental thesis is then developed in greater detail. As a matter of fact the leaders (i.e., the Social-Democrats, the organizers of the League of Struggle) were, one might say, torn out of the hands of the workers<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np43a">**</A>]</FONT> by the police; yet it is made to appear that the workers were fighting against the leaders, and liberated themselves from their yoke! Instead of sounding the call to go forward, towards the consolidation of the revolutionary organization and to the expansion of political activity, the call for a <I>retreat</I> to the purely trade union struggle was issued. It was announced that "the economic basis of the movement is eclipsed by the effort never to forget the political ideal," and that the watchword for the working-class movement was "Fight for economic conditions" (!) or, still better, "The

* It should be stated in passing that the praise of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> in November 1898, when Economism had become fully defined, especially abroad, emanated from that same V. I., who very soon after became one of the editors of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>. And yet the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> denied that there were two trends in Russian Social-Democracy, and continues to deny it to this day! <BR>

** That this simile is a correct one is shown by the following characteristic fact. When, after the arrest of the "Decembrists," the news was spread among the workers of the Schl&uumlsselburg Road that the discovery and arrest were facilitated by an agent-provocateur, N. N. Mikhailov, a dental surgeon, who had been in contact with a group associated with the "Decembrists," the workers were so enraged that they decided to kill him.

workers for the workers." It was declared that strike funds "are more valuable for the movement than a hundred other organizations" (compare this statement made in October 1897 with the controversy between the "Decembrists" and the young members in the beginning of 1897), and so forth. Catchwords like: We must concentrate not on the "cream" of the workers, but on the "average," mass worker: "Politics always obediently follows economics,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np44">*</A>]</FONT> etc., etc., became the fashion, and exercised an irresistible influence upon the masses of the youth who were attracted to the movement, but who, in the majority of cases, were acquainted only with such fragments of Marxism as were expounded in legally appearing publications.

    Consciousness was completely overwhelmed by spontaneity -- the spontaneity of the "Social-Democrats" who repeated Mr. V. V.'s "ideas," the spontaneity of those workers who were carried away by the arguments that a kopek added to a ruble was worth more than Socialism and politics, and that they must "fight, knowing that they are fighting not for some future generation, but for themselves and their children." (Leading article in the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>, No. 1.) Phrases like these have always been the favourite weapons of the West-European bourgeoisie, who, in their hatred for Socialism, strove (like the German "Sozial-Politiker" Hirsch) to transplant English trade unionism to their native soil and to

And now the "V. V.'s of Russian Social-Democracy" have set about repeating these bourgeois phrases. It is important at this point to note three circumstances which will be useful to us in our further analysis of <I>contemporary</I> differences.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np45a">**</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   First of all, the overwhelming of consciousness by spontaneity, to which we referred above, also took place <I>spontaneously</I>. This may sound like a pun, but, alas, it is the bitter truth. It did not take place as a result of an open struggle between two diametrically opposed points of view, in which one triumphed over the other; it occurred because an increasing number of "old" revolutionaries were "torn away" by the gendarmes and because increasing numbers of "young" "V.V.'s of Russian Social-Democracy" appeared on the scene. Everyone, who -- I shall not say has participated in the <I>contemporary</I> Russian movement? but has at least breathed its atmosphere -- knows perfectly well that this is precisely the case. And the reason why we, nevertheless, strongly insist that the reader be fully clear on this universally known fact, and why in order to be quite explicit, so to speak, we cite the details concerning the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> as it first appeared, and concerning the controversy between the "old"

** We emphasize the word contemporary for the benefit of those who may pharisaically shrug their shoulders and say: it is easy enough to attack the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> now, but is not all this ancient history? <I>Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur</I> (change the name and the tale refers to you --<I>Tr.</I>), we reply to such contemporary pharisees whose complete subjection to the ideas of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> will be proved further on.

and the "young" at the beginning of 1897 -- is that certain persons are speculating on the public's (or the very youthful youths') ignorance of this fact, and are boasting of their "democracy." We shall return to this point further on. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Secondly, in the very first literary manifestation of Economism, we can already observe the extremely curious phenomenon -- one highly characteristic for an understanding of all the differences prevailing among contemporary Social-Democrats -- that the adherents of the "pure" working-class movement, the worshippers of the closest "organic" (the term used by the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>) contacts with the proletarian struggle, the opponents of any non-worker intelligentsia (even if it be a socialist intelligentsia) are compelled, in order to defend their positions, to resort to the arguments of the bourgeois "pure" trade unionists. This shows that from the very outset the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> began -- unconsciously --  to carry out the program of the <I>Credo</I>. This shows (something the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> cannot understand at all) that all worship of the spontaneity of the working-class movement, all belittling of the role of "the conscious element," of the role of Social-Democracy, <I>means, quite irrespective of whether the belittler wants to or not, strengthening the influence of the bourgeois ideology over the workers</I>. All those who talk about "overrating the importance of ideology,"* about exaggerating the role of the conscious element,** etc., imagine that the pure working-class movement can work out, and will work out, an independent ideology for itself, if only the workers "wrest their fate from the hands of the leaders." But this is a profound mistake. To supplement

what has been said above, we shall quote the following profoundly just and important utterances by Karl Kautsky on the new draft program of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party:<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np47">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=-1>
  "Many of our revisionist critics believe that Marx asserted that economic development and the class struggle create not only the conditions for socialist production, but also, and directly, the <I>consciousness</I> (K. K.'s italics) of its necessity. And these critics aver that England, the country most highly developed capitalistically, is more remote than any other from this consciousness. Judging from the draft, one might assume that this allegedly orthodox-Marxist view, which is thus refuted, was shared by the committee that drafted the Austrian program. In the draft program it is stated: 'The more capitalist development increases the numbers of the proletariat, the more the proletariat is compelled and becomes fit to fight against capitalism. The proletariat becomes conscious' of the possibility and of the necessity for Socialism. In this connection socialist consciousness appears to be a necessary and direct result of the proletarian class struggle. But this is absolutely untrue. Of course, Socialism, as a doctrine, has its roots in modern economic relationships just as the class struggle of the proletariat has, and, just as the latter, emerges from the struggle against the capitalist-created poverty and misery of the masses. But Socialism and the classs struggle arise side by side and not one out of the other; each arises under different conditions. Modern socialist consciousness can arise only on the basis of profound scientific knowledge. Indeed, modern economic science is as much a condition for socialist production as, say, modern technology, and the proletariat can create neither the one nor the other, no matter how much it may desire to do so; both arise out of the modern social process. The vehicle of science is not the proletariat, but the <I>bourgeois intelligentsia</I> (K. K.'s italics): it was in the minds of individual members of this stratum that modern Socialism originated, and it was they who communicated it to the more intellectually developed proletarians who, in their turn, introduce it into the proletarian class struggle where conditions allow that to be done. Thus, socialist consciousness is something introduced into the

proletarian class struggle from without (von Aussen Hineingetragenes) and not something that arose within it spontaneously (urw&uumlchsig). Accordingly, the old Hainfeld program quite rightly stated that the task of Social-Democracy is to imbue the proletariat (literally: saturate the proletariat) with the <I>consciousness</I> of its position and the consciousness of its task There would be no need for this if consciousness arose of itself from the class struggle. The new draft copied this proposition from the old program, and attached it to the proposition mentioned above. But this completely broke the line of thought. . . ."

   Since there can be no talk of an independent ideology being developed by the masses of the workers themselves in the process of their movement* the <I>only</I> choice is: either the bourgeois or the socialist ideology. There is no middle course (for humanity has not created a "third" ideology, and, moreover, in a society torn class antagonisms there can never be a non-class or above-class ideology. Hence, to belittle the socialist ideology <I>in any way</I>, to <I>turn away from it in the slightest degree</I> means to strengthen bourgeois ideology. 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
* This does not mean, of course, that the workers have no part in creating such an ideology. But they take part not as workers, but as socialist theoreticians, as Proudhons and Weitlings; in other words, they take part only when, and to the extent that they are able, more or less, to acquire the knowledge of their age and advance that knowledge. And in order that workingmen <I>may be able to do this more often</I>, every effort must be made to raise the level of the consciousness of the workers generally; the workers must not confine themselves to the artificially restricted limits of "<I>literature for workers</I>" but should learn to master <I>general literature</I> to an increasing degree. It would be even more true to say "are not confined," instead of "must not confine themselves," because the workers themselves wish to read and do read all that is written for the intelligentsia and it is only a few (bad) intellectuals who believe that it is sufficient "for the workers" to be told a few things about factory conditions, and to have repeated to them over and over again what has long been known.

There is a lot of talk about spontaneity, but the <I>spontaneous</I> development of the working-class movement leads to its be coming subordinated to the bourgeois ideology, <I>leads to its developing according to the program</I> of the <I>Credo</I>, for the spontaneous working-class movement is trade unionism, is Nur-Gewerkschaftlerei, and trade unionism means the ideological enslavement of the workers by the bourgeoisie. Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is to <I>combat spontaneity</I>, to <I>divert</I> the working-class movement from this spontaneous, trade-unionist striving to come under the wing of the bourgeoisie, and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social-Democracy. The phrase employed by the authors of the "economic" letter in the <I>Iskra</I>, No. 12, about the efforts of the most inspired ideologists not being able to divert the working-class movement from the path that is determined by the interaction of the material elements and the material environment, <I>is absolutely tantamount</I> therefore <I>to the abandonment of Socialism</I>, and if only the authors of this letter were capable of fearlessly, consistently and thoroughly considering what they say, as everyone who enters the arena of literary and public activity should do, there would be nothing left for them but to "fold their useless arms over their empty breasts" and . . . Ieave the field of action to Messrs. the Struves and Prokopoviches who are dragging the working-class movement "along the line of least resistance," i.e., along the line of bourgeois trade unionism, or to the Zubatovs, who are dragging it along the line of clerical and gendarme "ideology." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Recall the example of Germany. What was the historical service Lassalle rendered to the German working-class movement? It was that he <I>diverted</I> that movement from the path 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 50</B></FONT><P>

of trade unionism and cooperation preached by the Progressives along which it had been travelling spontaneously (<I>with the benign assistance of Schulze-Delitzsch and those like him </I>). To fulfil a task like that it was necessary to do something altogether different from indulging in talk about underrating the spontaneous element, about tactics-as-a-process, about the interaction between elements and environment, etc. A <I>fierce struggle against spontaneity</I> was necessary, and only after such a struggle, extending over many years, was it possible, for instance, to convert the working population of <A NAME="p50"> Berlin from a bulwark of the Progressive Party into one of the finest strongholds of Social-Democracy. This fight is by no means finished even now (as might seem to those who learn the history of the German movement from Prokopovich, and its philosophy from Struve). Even now the German working class is, so to speak, broken up among a number of ideologies. A section of the workers is organized in Catholic and monarchist labour unions; another section is organized in the Hirsch-Duncker unions,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n52">52</A>]</FONT> founded by the bourgeois worshippers of English trade unionism, while a third section is organized in Social-Democratic trade unions. The last is immeasurably more numerous than all the rest, but the Social Democratic ideology was able to achieve this superiority, and will be able to maintain it, only by unswervingly fighting against all other ideologies. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   But why, the reader will ask, does the spontaneous movement, the movement along the line of the least resistance, lead to the domination of the bourgeois ideology? For the simple reason that the bourgeois ideology is far older than the socialist ideology; because it is more fully developed and because it possesses <I>immeasurably</I> more op-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 51</B></FONT><P>

portunities for being spread.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np51">*</A>]</FONT> And the younger the socialist movement is in any given country, the more vigorously must it fight against all attempts to entrench non-socialist ideology, and the more strongly must the workers be warned against those bad counsellors who shout against "overrating the conscious element," etc. The authors of the economic letter, in unison with the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, declaim against the intolerance that is characteristic of the infancy of the movement. To this we reply: yes, our movement is indeed in its infancy, and in order that it may grow up the more quickly, it must become infected with intolerance against those who retard its growth by their subservience to spontaneity. Nothing is so ridiculous and harmful as pretending that we are "old hands" who have long ago experienced all the decisive episodes of the struggle. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    Thirdly, the first number of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> shows that the term "Economism" (which, of course, we do not propose to abandon because, however it may be, this appellation has already established itself) does not adequately convey the real character of the new trend. The <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> does not altogether repudiate the political struggle: the rules

* It is often said: the working class <I>spontaneously</I> gravitates towards Socialism. This is perfectly true in the sense that socialist theory defines the causes of the misery of the working class more profoundly and more correctly than any other theory, and for that reason the workers are able to assimilate it so easily, <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that this theory does not itself yield to spontaneity, <I>provided</I> it subordinates spontaneity to itself. Usually this is taken for granted, but it is precisely this which the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> forgets or distorts. The working class spontaneously gravitates towards Socialism, but the more widespread (and continuously revived in the most diverse forms) bourgeois ideology nevertheless spontaneously imposes itself upon the working class still more.

for a workers' benefit fund published in the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>, No. 1, contain a reference to combating the government. The <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> believes, however, that "politics alwavs obediently follows economics" (and the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> gives a variation of this thesis when, in its program, it asserts that "in Russia more than in any other country, the economic struggle is <I>inseparable</I> from the political struggle"). <I>If by politics is meant Social-Democratic politics</I>, then the postulates advanced by the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> and the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> are absolutely wrong. The economic struggle of the workers is very often connected (although not inseparably) with bourgeois politics, clerical politics, etc., as we have already seen. The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>'s postulates are correct if by politics is meant trade union politics, i.e., the common striving of all workers to secure from the government measures for the alleviation of the distress characteristic of their position, but which do not abolish that position, i.e., which do not remove the subjection of labour to capital. That striving indeed is common to the British trade unionists who are hostile to Socialism, to the Catholic workers, to the "Zubatov" workers, etc. There are politics and politics. Thus, we see that the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> does not so much deny the political as to bow to its <I>spontaneity</I>, to its lack of consciousness. While fully recognizing the political struggle (it would be more correct to say the political desires and demands of the workers), which arises spontaneously from the working-class movement itself, it absolutely refuses <I>independently to work out</I> a specifically <I>Social-Democratic policy</I> corresponding to the general tasks of Socialism and to contemporary conditions in Russia. Further on we shall show that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> commits the same error.

  We have dealt at such length with the little-known and now almost forgotten leading article in the first number of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> because it was the first and most striking expression of that general stream of thought which afterwards emerged into the light of day in innumerable streamlets. V. I. was absolutely right when, in praising the first number and the leading article of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>, he said that it was written in a "sharp and challenging" style. (<I>Listok Rabotnika</I>, No. 9-10, p. 49.) Every man with convictions who thinks he has something new to say writes "challengingly" and in such a way as to make his views stand out in bold relief. Only those who are accustomed to sitting between two stools lack "challenge"; only such people are able to praise the challenge of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> one day, and attack the "challenging polemics" of its opponents the next. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; <A NAME="p53">
   We shall not dwell on the Special Supplement to the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> (further on we shall have occasion, on various points, to refer to this work, which expresses the ideas of the Economists more consistently than any other) but shall briefly mention the <I>Manifesto of the Self-Emancipation of the Workers Group</I> (March 1899, reprinted in the London <I>Nakanunye</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n54">54</A>]</FONT> No. 7, July 1899). The authors of this manifesto quite rightly say that "the workers of Russia are <I>only just awakening</I>, are only just looking around, and <I>instinctively clutch at the first available</I> means of struggle." But from this they draw the same incorrect conclusion that is drawn by the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>, forgetting that instinctiveness is that unconsciousness (spontaneity) to the aid of which Socialists must come; that the "first available means of struggle" will always 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 54</B></FONT><P>

be, in modern society, the trade union means of struggle, and the "first available" ideology will be the bourgeois (trade union) ideology. Similarly, these authors do not "repudiate" politics, they merely say (merely!), repeating what was said by Mr. V. V., that politics is the superstructure, and therefore, "political agitation must be the superstructure to the agitation carried on in favour of the economic struggle; it must arise on the basis of this struggle and follow in its wake." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    As for the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, it started out on its career by "defending" the Economists. It uttered a <I>downright falsehood</I> in its very first issue (No. 1, pp. 141-42) when it stated that it "does not know which young comrades Axelrod referred to" in his well-known pamphlet,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np54">*</A>]</FONT> in which he uttered a warning to the Economists. In the controversy that flared up with Axelrod and Plekhanov over this falsehood, the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> was compelled to admit that "by expressing perplexity, it desired to <I>defend</I> all the younger Social-Democrats abroad from this unjust accusation" (Axelrod accused the Economists <A NAME="p54"> of having a narrow outlook). As a matter of fact this accusation was absolutely just, and the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> knows perfectly well that, among others, it applied to V. I., a member of its editorial staff. Let me note in passing that in this controversy Axelrod was absolutely right and the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> was absolutely wrong in their respective interpretations of my pamphlet <I>The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n55">55</A>]</FONT> That pamphlet was written in 1897, before the appearance of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> when I thought, and rightly thought, that the original tendency of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle, which I described above, was the predominant one. And that

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 55</B></FONT><P>
 
tendency really was the predominant one, at any rate until the middle of 1898. Consequently, the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> had no right whatever, in its attempt to refute the existence and dangers of Economism, to refer to a pamphlet which expressed views that were <I>squeezed out</I> by "Economist" views in St. Petersburg in 1897-98.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np55">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    But the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> not only "defended" the Economists -- it itself constantly fell into their fundamental errors. The source of this confusedness is to be found in the ambiguity of the interpretation given to the following thesis of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> program: "We consider that the most important phenomenon of Russian life, the one that will mainly <I>determine the tasks</I>" (our italics) "and the character of the literary activity of the Union, is the <I>mass working-class movement</I>" (<I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>'s italics) "that has arisen in recent years." That the mass movement is a most important phenomenon is a fact about which there can be no dispute. But the crux of the question is, how is one to understand the statement that the mass working-class movement will "determine the tasks"? It may be interpreted in one of two ways.

<FONT SIZE=-1>

* To its defence of the first untruth it uttered ("we do not know which young comrades Axelrod referred to"), the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> added a second, when, in its <I>Reply</I>, it wrote: "Since the review of <I>The Tasks</I> was published, tendencies have arisen, or have become more or less clearly defined among certain Russian Social-Democrats, towards economic one-sidedness, which represent a step backwards from the state of our movement as described in <I>The Tasks</I>" (p. 9). This is what the <I>Reply</I> says, <I>published in 1900</I>. But the first number of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> (containing the review) appeared in <I>April 1899</I>. Did Economism really arise only in 1899? No. The year 1899 saw the first protest of the <I>Russian</I> Social-Democrats against Economism (the protest against the <I>Credo</I>). Economism arose in 1897, as the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> very well knows, <I>for already in November 1898, V. I.</I> was praising the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> (see the <I>Listok Rabotnika</I>, No. 9-10).

<I>Either</I> it means bowing to the spontaneity of this movement, i.e., reducing the role of Social-Democracy to mere subservience to the working-class movement as such (the interpretation given to it by the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>, the Self-Emancipation Group and other Economists); <I>or</I> it means that the mass movement puts before us new theoretical, political and organizational tasks, far more complicated than those that might have satisfied us in the period before the rise of the mass movement. The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> inclined and still inclines towards the first interpretation, for it has said nothing definite about any new tasks, but argued all the time just as if the "mass movement" relieves us of the necessity of clearly appreciating and fulfilling the tasks it sets before us. We need only point out that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> considered that it was impossible to set the overthrow of the autocracy as the first task of the mass working-class movement, and that it degraded this task (in the interests of the mass movement) to that of a struggle for immediate political demands. (<I>Reply</I>, p. 25.)    We shall pass over the article by B. Krichevsky, the editor of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, entitled "The Economic and Political

What interests us here solely are the principles expounded by the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 10.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The "stages theory," or the theory of "timid zigzags" in the political struggle, is expressed, for example, in this article, in the following way: "Political demands, which in their character are common to the whole of Russia, should, however, at first" (this was written in August 1900!) "correspond to the experience gained by the given stratum" (<I>sic</I>!) "of workers in the economic struggle. Only (!) on the basis of this experience can and should political agitation be taken up," etc. (P. 11.) On page 4, the author, protesting against what he regards as the absolutely unfounded charge of Economist heresy, pathetically exclaims: "What Social-Democrat does not know that according to the theories of Marx and Engels the economic interests of various classes play a decisive role in history, and, <I>consequently</I>, that particularly the proletariat's struggle for the defence of its economic interests must be of first-rate importance [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 57. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] in its class development and struggle for emancipation?" (Our italics.) The word "consequently" is absolutely out of place. The fact that economic interests play a decisive role <I>does not in the least imply</I> that the cconomic (i.e., trade union) struggle is of prime importance, for the most essential, the "decisive" interests of classes can be satisfied <I>only</I> by radical <I>political</I> changes in general. In particular the fundamental economic interests of the proletariat can be satisfied only by a political revolution that will replace the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie by the dictatorship of the proletariat. B. Krichevsky repeats the arguments of the "V. V.'s of Russian Social-Democracy" (i.e., politics follow economics, etc.) and the Bernsteinians of German Social-Democracy (for example, by arguments like these, Woltmann tried to prove that the workers must first of all acquire "economic power" before they can think about political revolution) .

pedient -- with the demand that <I>at a given political moment</I>, if we are to talk of tactics, we be guided by a strictly observed plan, is tantamount to confusing the recognition by medical science of various methods of treatment of diseases with the necessity for adopting a certain definite method of treatment for a given disease. The point is, however, that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, while itself the victim of a disease which we have called bowing to spontaneity, refuses to recognize any "method of treatment" for that disease. Hence, it made the remarkable discovery that "tactics-as-a-plan contradicts the fundamental spirit of Marxism" (No. 10, p. 18), that tactics are "<I>a process of growth of Party tasks, which grow together with the Party</I>." (P. 11, the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>'s italics.) The latter remark has every chance of becoming a celebrated maxim, a permanent monument to the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> "trend." To the question: <I>whither</I> a leading organ replies: movement is a process of altering the distance between the starting point and subsequent points of the movement. This matchless example of profundity is not merely a curiosity (if it were, it would not be worth dealing with at length), but <I>the program of a whole trend</I>, i.e., the very program which R.M. (in the Special Supplement to the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> ) expressed in the words: That struggle is desirable which is possible, and the struggle which is possible is the one that is going on at a given moment. This is precisely the trend of unbounded opportunism, which passively adapts itself to spontaneity.  

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   "Tactics-as-a-plan contradicts the fundamental spirit of Marxism!" But this is a libel on Marxism; it means turning it into the caricature of Marxism that was set up by the Narodniks in their fight against us. It means belittling the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 59</B></FONT><P>

initiative and energy of class-conscious fighters, whereas Marxism, on the contrary, gives a gigantic impetus to the initiative and energy of the Social-Democrat, opens up for him the widest perspectives and (if one may so express it) places at his disposal the mighty force of millions and millions of workers "spontaneously" rising for the struggle! The whole history of international Social-Democracy seethes with plans advanced now by one, now by another political leader; some confirming the farsightedness and correct political and organizational views of their authors and others revealing their shortsightedness and political errors. At the time when Germany was at one of the most important turning points in its history -- the formation of the Empire, the opening of the Reichstag and the granting of universal suffrage -- Liebknecht had one plan for Social-Democratic policy and work in general and Schweitzer had another. When the Anti-Socialist Law came down on the heads of the German Socialists, Most and Hasselmann had one plan, they were prepared there and then to call for violence and terror; H&oumlchberg, Schramm and (partly) Bernstein had another: they began to preach to the Social-Democrats that they themselves had provoked the enactment of the Law by being unreasonably bitter and revolutionary, and must now earn forgiveness by their exemplary conduct. There was yet a third plan proposed by those who paved the way for and carried out the publication of an illegal organ. It is easy, of course, in retrospect, many years after the fight over the selection of the path to be followed has ended, and after history has pronounced its verdict as to the expediency of the path selected, to utter profound maxims about the growth of Party tasks, which grow together with the Party. But at a time of con-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 60</B></FONT><P>

fusion,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np60">*</A>]</FONT> when the Russian "critics" and Economists are degrading Social-Democracy to the level of trade unionism, and when the terrorists are stronglv advocating the adoption of "tactics-as-a-plan" that repeats the old mistakes, at such a time, to confine oneself to such profundities, means simply issuing oneself a "certificate of poverty." At a time when many Russian Social-Democrats suffer from lack of initiative and energy, from a lack of "scope of political propaganda, agitation and organization,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n58">58</A>]</FONT> a lack of "plans" for a broader organization of revolutionary work, at such a time, to say: "tactics-as-a-plan contradicts the fundamental spirit of Marxism," means not only vulgarizing Marxism in the realm of theory, but also <I>dragging the Party backward</I> in practice. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> goes on to sermonize:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT SIZE=-1>
   "The task of the revolutionary Social-Democrat is only to accelerate objective development by his conscious work; not to obviate it or substitute his own subjective plans for this development. The <I>Iskra</I> knows all this in theory. But the enormous importance which Marxism quite justly attaches to conscious revolutionary work causes it in practice, owing to its doctrinaire view of tactics, to <I>belittle tbe significance of the objective or the spontaneous element of development</I>." (P. 18.) 
</FONT>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Another example of the extraordinary theoretical confusion worthy of Mr. V.V. and that fraternity. We would ask our philosopher: how may a deviser of subjective plans "belittle" objective development? Obviously by losing sight of the fact that this objective development creates or strengthens, destroys or weakens certain classes, strata, groups, certain nations, groups of nations, etc., and in this way serves as the

* "<I>Ein Jahr der Verwirrung</I>" ("Year of Confusion") is the title Mehring gave to the chapter of his <I>History of German Social-Democracy</I> in which he describes the hesitancy and lack of determination displayed at first by the Socialists in selecting the "tactics-as-a-plan" for the new situation. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 61</B></FONT><P>

premise for a definite international political alignment of forces, for determining the position of revolutionary parties, etc. If the deviser of plans did that, his guilt would not be that he belittled the spontaneous element, but, on the contrary, that he belittled the <I>conscious</I> element, for he would then show that he lacked the "consciousness" properly to understand objective development. Hence, the very talk about "estimating the <I>relative</I> significance" (the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>'s italics) of spontaneity and consciousness itself reveals a complete lack of "consciousness." If certain "spontaneous elements of development" can be grasped at all by human understanding, then an incorrect estimation of them will be tantamount to "belittling the conscious element." But if they cannot be grasped, then we cannot know them, and therefore cannot speak of them. What is B. Krichevsky arguing about then? If he thinks that the <I>Iskra</I>'s "subjective plans" are erroneous <A NAME="p61"> (as he in fact declares them to be), then he ought to show what objective facts are ignored in these plans, and then charge the <I>Iskra</I> with a <I>lack of consciousness</I> for ignoring them, with, to use his own words, "belittling the conscious element." If, however, while being displeased with subjective plans he can bring forward no other argument than that of "belittling the spontaneous element" (!!) he merely shows: 1) that theoretically he understands Marxism &agrave la the Kareyevs and Mikhailovskys, who have been sufficiently ridiculed by Beltov,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n59">59</A>]</FONT> and 2) that, practically, he is quite pleased with the "spontaneous elements of development" that have drawn our legal Marxists towards Bernsteinism and our Social-Democrats towards Economism, and that he is full of wrath against those who have determined at all costs to divert Russian Social-Democracy from the path of "spontaneous" development.

  And then follow things that are positively funny. "Just as human beings will multiply in the old-fashioned way, notwithstanding all the discoveries of natural science, so the birth of a new social order will come about, in the future too, <I>mainly</I> as a result of elemental outbursts, notwithstanding all the discoveries of social science and the increase in the number of conscious fighters." (P. 19.) Just as our grandfathers in their old-fashioned wisdom used to say: "Any fool can bring forth children," today the "modern Socialists" (<I>&agrave la</I> Narcissus Tuporylov)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n60">60</A>]</FONT> in their wisdom say: Any fool can participate in the spontaneous birth of a new social order. We too are of that opinion. All that is required for participation of that kind is to <I>yield</I>, to Economism when Economism reigns, and to terrorism when terrorism arises. For example, in the spring of this year, when it was so important to utter a note of warning against infatuation with terrorism, the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> stood in amazement, confronted by a problem that was "new" to it. And now, six months after, when the problem has become less topical, it, at one and the same time, pre sents us with the declaration: "We think that it is not and should not be the task of Social-Democracy to counteract the rise of terroristic sentiments" (<I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 10, p. 23), and the congress resolution: "The congress regards systematic and aggressive terror as being inopportune" (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 18). How beautifully clear and coherent this is! Not to counteract, but to declare inopportune, and to declare it in such a way that unsystematic and defensive terror does not come within the scope of the "resolution." It must be admitted that a resolution like that is extremely safe and completely insured against error, just as a man who talks, but says nothing, is insured against error! And all that is required to frame such a resolution is: ability to keep <I>at the</I>

<I>tail end</I> of the movement. When the <I>Iskra</I> ridiculed the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> for declaring the question of terror to be a new one,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n61">61</A>]</FONT> the latter angrily accused the <I>Iskra</I> of "having the incredible effrontery to impose upon the Party organization solutions of tactical questions proposed by a group of emigrant writers more than fifteen years ago" (p. 24). Effrontery indeed, and what an overrating of the conscious element --  first to find the theoretical solutions to problems, and then to try to prove to the organization, to the Party and to the masses that this solution is correct!<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np63">*</A>]</FONT> How much better it would be to repeat something that has been learned by rote, and, without "imposing" anything upon anybody, swing with every "turn" -- whether in the direction of Economism or in the direction of terrorism. The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> even generalizes this great precept of worldly wisdom and accuses the <I>Iskra</I> and the <I>Zarya</I> of "setting up their program against the movement, like a spirit hovering over the formless chaos." (P. 29.) But what else is the function of Social-Democracy if not to be a "spirit," not only hovering over the spontaneous movement, but also <I>raising</I> this movement <I>to the level of "its program</I>"? Surely, it is not its function to drag at the tail of the movement: at best, this would be of no service to the movement; at the worst, it would be very, very harmful. The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, however, not only follows this ''tactics-as-a-process," but elevates it to a principle, so that it would be more correct to describe its tendency not as opportunism, but as tail-ism (from the word tail).

&nbsp;&nbsp;
  And so, we have become convinced that the fundamental error committed by the "new trend" in Russian Social-Democracy lies in its bowing to spontaneity, and its failure to understand that the spontaneity of the masses demands a mass of consciousness from us Social-Democrats. The greater the spontaneous upsurge of the masses, the more widespread the movement becomes, so much the more rapidly, incomparably more rapidly, grows the demand for greater consciousness in the theoretical, political and organizational work of Social-Democracy. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The spontaneous upsurge of the masses in Russia proceeded (and continues) with such rapidity that the young Social Democrats proved unprepared for these gigantic tasks. This unpreparedness is our common misfortune, the misfortune of all Russian Social-Democrats. The upsurge of the masses proceeded and spread uninterruptedly and with continuity; it not only continued in the places where it began, but spread to new localities and to new strata of the population (under the influence of the working-class movement, there was a revival of ferment among the students, the intellectuals generally and even among the peasantry). Revolutionaries, however, lagged behind this upsurge both in their "theories" and in their activity; they failed to establish an uninterrupted organization having continuity with the past, and capable of leading the whole movement. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   In Chapter I, we proved that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> belittled our theoretical tasks and that it "spontaneously" repeated the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 65</B></FONT><P>

fashionable catchword "freedom of criticism": that those who repeated this catchword lacked the "consciousness" to understand how diametrically opposed are the positions of the opportunist "critics" and the revolutionaries in Germany and in Russia. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   In the following chapters, we shall show how this worship of spontaneity found exprcssion in the sphere of the political tasks and the organizational work of Social-Democracy.

  We shall start off again by praising the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>. "Exposure Literature and the Proletarian Struggle" is the title Martynov gave his article in No. 10 of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, on his differences with the <I>Iskra</I>. He formulated the substance of these differences as follows: "We cannot confine ourselves entirely to exposing the system that stands in its" (the working-class party's) "path of development. We must also react to the immediate and current interests of the proletariat." (P. 63.) " . . . the <I>Iskra</I> . . . is in fact an organ of revolutionary opposition that exposes the state of affairs in our country, particularly the political state of affairs. . . . We, however, work and shall continue to work for the cause of the working class in close organic contact with the proletarian struggle." (P. 63.) One cannot help being grateful to Martynov for this formula. It is of outstanding general interest because substantially it embraces not only our disagreements with the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, but the general disagreement between ourselves and the "Econ-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 67</B></FONT><P>

omists" concerning the political struggle. We have already shown that the "Economists" do not altogether repudiate "politics," but that they are constantly straying from the Social-Democratic to the trade-unionist conception of politics. Martynov strays in exactly the same way, and we agree, therefore, to take his views as a model of Economist error on this question. As we shall endeavour to prove, neither the authors of the Special Supplement to the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I>, nor the authors of the manifesto issued by the Self-Emancipation Group, nor the authors of the Economist letter published in the <I>Iskra</I>, No. 12, will have any right to complain against this choice.

  Everyone knows that the extensive spread and consolidation of the economic* struggle of the Russian workers proceeded simultaneously with the creation of a "literature" exposing economic conditions, i.e., factory and industrial conditions. These "leaflets" were devoted mainly to the exposure of factory conditions, and very soon a veritable passion for exposures was roused among the workers. As soon as the workers realized that the Social-Democratic circles desired to and could supply them with a new kind of leaflet that

* To avoid misunderstanding we must point out that here and throughout this pamphlet, by economic struggle we imply (in accordance with the meaning of the term as accepted among us) the "practical economic struggle" which Engels, in the passage quoted above, described as "resistance to the capitalists," and which in free countries is known as the professional, syndical or trade union struggle.

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 68</B></FONT><P>

told the whole truth about their life of poverty, about their excessive toil and their lack of rights, correspondence began to pour in from the factories and workshops. This "exposure literature" created a huge sensation not only in the particular factory, the conditions of which were exposed in the given leaflet, but in all the factories to which news spread about the facts exposed. And as the poverty and want among the workers in the various enterprises and in the various trades are much the same, the "truth about the life of the workers" stirred all. Even among the most backward workers, a veritable passion arose to "go into print" -- a noble passion for this rudimentary form of war against the whole of the contemporary social system which is based upon robbery and oppression. And in the overwhelming majority of cases these "leaflets" were in truth a declaration of war, because the exposures served greatly to agitate the workers; they evoked among them the common demands for the removal of the most glaring evils and roused in them a readiness to support these demands with strikes. Finally, the employers themselves were compelled to recognize the significance of these leaflets as a declaration of war, so much so that in a large number of cases they did not even wait for the outbreak of hostilities. As is always the case, the mere publication of these exposures made them effective, and they acquired the significance of a strong moral influence. On more than one occasion, the mere appearance of a leaflet proved sufficient to secure the satisfaction of all or part of the demands put forward. In a word, economic (factory) exposures were and remain an important lever in the economic struggle. And they will continue to retain this significance as long as capitalism exists, which creates the need for the workers to defend themselves. Even in the most advanced countries

of Europe we can still witness how the exposure of evils in some backward trade, or in some forgotten branch of domestic industry, serves as a starting point for the awakening of class consciousness, for the beginning of a trade union struggle, and for the spread of Socialism.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np69">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The overwhelming majority of Russian Social-Democrats have of late been almost entirely absorbed by this work of organizing the exposure of factory conditions. It is sufficient to recall the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> to see to what extent they were taken up by it. So much so, indeed, that they lost sight of the fact that this, <I>taken by itself</I>, is in essence still not Social-Democratic work, but merely trade union work. As a matter of fact, these exposures merely dealt with the relations between the workers <I>in a given trade</I> and their employers, and all that they achieved was that the sellers of labour power learned to sell their "commodity" on better terms and to fight the purchasers over a purely commercial deal. These exposures could have served (if

* In the present chapter, we deal only with the political struggle, in its broader or narrower meaning. Therefore, we note only in passing, merely as a curiosity, the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>'s charge that the <I>Iskra</I> is "too restrained" in regard to the economic struggle. (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 27, rehashed by Martynov in his pamphlet <I>Social-Democracy and the Working Class</I>.) If those who make this accusation counted up in terms of hundred weights or reams (as they are so fond of doing) what has been said about the economic struggle in the industrial column of the <I>Iskra</I> in one year, and compared this with the industrial columns of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> and the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> taken together, they would easily see that they lag behind even in this respect. Apparently, the consciousness of this simple truth compels them to resort to arguments which clearly reveal their confusion. "The <I>Iskra</I>" they write, "willy-nilly (! ) is compelled (! ) to reckon with the imperative demands of life and to publish at least (!! ) correspondence about the working-class movement." (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 27.) Now this is really a crushing argument!

properly utilized by an organization of revolutionaries) as a beginning and a constituent part of Social-Democratic activity, but they could also have led (and, given a worshipful attitude towards spontaneity, were bound to lead) to a "pure" trade union struggle and to a non-Social-Democratic working-class movement. Social-Democracy leads the struggle of the working class not only for better terms for the sale of labour power, but also for the abolition of the social system which compels the propertyless to sell themselves to the rich. Social-Democracy represents the working class not in the latter's relation to only a given group of employers, but in its relation to all classes of modern society, to the state as an organized political force. Hence, it follows that Social-Democrats not only must not confine themselves entirely to the economic struggle; they must not even allow the organization of economic exposures to become the predominant part of their activities. We must actively take up the political education of the working class and the development of its political consciousness. <I>Now</I> that the <I>Zarya</I> and the <I>Iskra</I> have made the first attack upon Economism, "all are agreed" on this (although some agree only in words, as we shall soon see). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The question arises: what should political education consist of? Can it be confined to the propaganda of working-class hostility to the autocracy? Of course not. It is not enough to <I>explain</I> to the workers that they are politically oppressed (no more than it was to <I>explain</I> to them that their interests were antagonistic to the interests of the employers). Agitation must be conducted over every concrete example of this oppression (in the same way that we have begun to conduct agitation around concrete examples of economic oppression).

classes of society, inasmuch as it manifests itself in the most varied spheres of life and activity, industrial, civic, personal, family, religious, scientific, etc., etc., is it not evident that <I>we shall not be fulfilling our task</I> of developing the political consciousness of the workers if we do not <I>undertake</I> the organization of the <I>political exposure </I> of the autocracy <I>in all its aspects</I>? In order to carry on agitation around concrete examples of oppression, these examples must be exposed (just as it was necessary to expose factory abuses in order to carry on economic agitation).

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   One would think that this was clear enough. It turns out, however, that it is only in words that "all" are agreed on the need to develop political consciousness, <I>in all its aspects</I>. It turns out that the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, for example, far from tackling the task of organizing (or making a start in organizing) comprehensive political exposure, is even trying to <I>drag</I> the <I>Iskra</I>, which has undertaken this task, <I>away from it</I>. Listen to this: "The political struggle of the working class is merely" (it is precisely not "merely") "the most developed, widest and most effective form of economic struggle." (Program of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, published in No. 1, p. 3.) "The Social-Democrats are now confronted with the task of, as far as possible, lending the economic struggle itself a political character." (Martynov, <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 10, p. 42.) "The economic struggle is the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into active political struggle." (Resolution passed by the Congress of the Union and "amendments" thereto, <I>Two Congresses</I>, pp. 11 and 17.) As the reader will observe, all these postulates permeate the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, from its very first number to the latest "Instructions to the Editors," and all of them evidently ex-

* We say "in general," because the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> speaks of general principles and of the general tasks of the whole Party.

agitation and for drawing the masses into the political struggle? The very opposite is true. Of the sum total of the cases in which the workers suffer (either on their own account or on account of those closely connected with them) from tyranny, violence and lack of rights, undoubtedly only a small minority represent cases of police tyranny in the economic struggle as such. Why then should we, beforehand, <I>restrict</I> the scope of political agitation by declaring only <I>one</I> of the means to be "the most widely applicable," when Social-Democrats have, in addition, other, generally speaking, no less "widely applicable" means? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Long, long ago (a year ago! . . . ) the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> wrote: "The masses begin to understand immediate political demands after one, or at all events, after several strikes," "immediately the government sets the police and gendarmerie against them" (No. 7, p. 15, <I>August</I> 1900). This opportunist theory of stages has now been rejected by the Union, which makes a concession to us by declaring: "There is no need whatever to conduct political agitation right from the beginning, exclusively on an economic basis." (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 11.) This very repudiation of part of its former errors by the Union will show the future historian of Russian Social-Democracy better than any number of lengthy arguments the depths to which our Economists have degraded Socialism! But the Union must be very naive indeed to imagine that the abandonment of one form of restricting politics will induce us to agree to another form of restriction! Would it not be more logical to say, in this case too, that the economic struggle should be conducted on the widest possible basis, that it should always be utilized for political agitation, but that "there is no need whatever" to regard the economic

struggle as the <I>most</I> widely applicable means of drawing the masses into active political struggle? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The Union attaches significance to the fact that it replaced the phrase "most widely applicable means" for the phrase "the best means" contained in one of the resolutions of the Fourth Congress of the Jewish Workers' Union (Bund).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n63">63</A>]</FONT> We confess that we hnd it difficult to say which of these resolutions is the better one. In our opinion <I>both are "worse</I>." Both the Union and the Bund fall into the error (partly, perhaps, unconsciously, under the influence of tradition) of giving an economic, trade-unionist interpretation to politics. Whether this is done by employing the word "best" or the words "most widely applicable" makes no material difference whatever. If the Union had said that "political agitation on an economic basis" is the most widely applied (and not "applicable") means it would have been right in regard to a certain period in the development of our Social-Democratic movement. It would have been right in regard to the <I>Economists</I> and to many (if not the majority) of the practical workers of 1898-1901, for these practical Economists <I>applied</I> political agitation (to the extent that they applied it at all!) <I>almost exclusively on an economic basis</I>. Political agitation on <I>such</I> lines was recognized and, as we have seen, even recommended by the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> and by the Self-Emancipation Group! The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> should have <I>strongly condemned</I> the fact that the useful work of economic agitation was accompanied by the harmful restriction of the political struggle, but instead of that, it declares the means most widely <I>applied</I> (<I>by the Economists </I>) to be the most widely <I>applicable</I>! It is not surprising that when we call these people Economists, they can do nothing else but pour every manner of abuse upon us, and call us "mystifiers," "disrupters," "papal

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   What real concrete meaning does Martynov attach to his words about Social-Democracy taking up the task of "lending the economic struggle itself a political character"? The economic struggle is the collective struggle of the workers against their employers for better terms <I>in the sale of their labour power</I>, for the better conditions of life and labour. This struggle is necessarily an industrial struggle, because conditions of labour differ very much in different trades, and, consequently, the fight to <I>improve</I> these conditions can only be conducted in respect to each trade (trade unions in the Western countries, temporary trade associations and leaflets in Russia, etc.). Lending "the economic struggle itself a political character" means, therefore, striving to secure satisfaction of these trade demands, the improvement of conditions of labour in each separate trade by means of "legislative and administrative measures" (as Martynov expresses it on the next page of his article, p. 43). This is exactly what all workers' trade unions do and always have done. Read the works of the thoroughly scientific (and "thoroughly" opportunist) Mr. and Mrs. Webb and you will see that the British trade unions long ago recognized, and have long been carrying out,

the task of "lending the economic struggle itself a political character"; they have long been fighting for the right to strike, for the removal of all legal hindrances to the cooperative and trade union movements, for laws protecting women and children, for the improvement of labour conditions by means of health and factory legislation, etc. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Thus, the pompous phrase about "lending the economic struggle itself a political character," which sounds so "terrifically" profound and revolutionary, serves as a screen to conceal what is in fact the traditional striving to <I>degrade</I> Social-Democratic politics to the level of trade union politics! On the pretext of rectifying the one-sidedness of the <I>Iskra</I>, which, it is alleged, places "the revolutionizing of dogma higher than the revolutionizing of life,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np76">*</A>]</FONT> we are presented with the <I>struggle for economic reform</I> as if it were some thing entirely new. As a matter of fact, the phrase "lending the economic struggle itself a political character" means nothing more than the struggle for economic reforms. And Martynov himself might have come to this simple conclusion had he only pondered over the significance of his own words. "Our Party," he says, turning his heaviest guns against the <I>Iskra</I>, "could and should have presented concrete demands to the government for legislative and administrative measures against economic exploitation, unemployment, famine, etc." (<I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 10, pp. 42-43.)

This is the Martynov variation of the application to the present chaotic state of our movement of the thesis: "Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programs," which we have already characterized above. As a matter of fact, this is merely a translation into Russian of the notorious Bernsteinian phrase: "The movement is everything, the final aim is nothing."

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 77</B></FONT><P>

forms? And again we ask the impartial reader, do we slander the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>-ites (may I be forgiven for this clumsy expression!) by calling them concealed Bernsteinians when they advance, as their point of <I>disagreement</I> with the <I>Iskra</I>, their thesis about the necessity of fighting for economic reforms? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Revolutionary Social-Democracy always included, and now includes, the fight for reforms as part of its activities. But it utilizes "economic" agitation for the purpose of presenting to the government, not only demands for all sorts of measures, but also (and primarily) the demand that it cease to be an autocratic government. More, it considers it its duty to present this demand to the government, not on the basis of the economic struggle <I>alone</I>, but on the basis of all manifestations in general of public and political life. In a word, it subordinates the struggle for reforms, as the part to the whole, to the revolutionary struggle for liberty and for Socialism. Martynov, however, resuscitates the theory of stages in a new form, and strives to prescribe an exclusively economic, so to speak, path of development for the political struggle. By coming out at this moment, when the revolutionary movement is on the upgrade, with an alleged special "task" of fighting for reforms, he is dragging the Party backwards and is playing into the hands of both "economic" and liberal opportunism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   To proceed. While shamefacedly hiding the struggle for reforms behind the pompous thesis about "lending the economic struggle itself a political character," Martynov advanced, as if it were a special point, <I>exclusively economic</I> (in fact exclusively factory) <I>reforms</I>. Why he did that, we do not know. Perhaps it was due to carelessness? But if he had in mind something else besides "factory" reforms, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 78</B></FONT><P>

then the whole of his thesis, which we have just quoted, loses all sense. Perhaps he did it because he thinks it possible and probable that the government will make "concessions" only in the economic sphere?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np78">*</A>]</FONT> If so, then it is a strange delusion. Concessions are also possible and are made in the sphere of legislation concerning flogging, passports, land compensation payments, religious sects, the censorship, etc., etc. "Economic" concessions (or pseudo concessions) are, of course, the cheapest and most advantageous from the government's point of view, because by these means it hopes to win the confidence of the masses of the workers. For this very reason, we Social-Democrats <I>must not</I> under any circumstances or in any way whatever create grounds for the belief (or the misunderstanding) that we attach greater value to economic reforms, or that we regard them as being particularly important, etc. <A NAME="p78"> "Such demands," writes Martynov concerning the concrete demands for legislative and administrative measures referred to above, "would not be merely a hollow sound, because, promising certain palpable results, they might be actively supported by the masses of the workers. . . ." We are not Economists, oh no!

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Take for example the very "measures" for the relief of unemployment and the famine that Martynov himself advances.

They ought to be sent to Krichevsky and Martynov to be taught that tactics are a process of growth, of that which grows, etc., and that the economic struggle <I>i t s e I f</I> should be given a political character!

home to the workers that they have no political rights." (Martynov, p. 44.) We quote this passage not in order to repeat for the hundredth and thousandth time what has already been said above, but in order particularly to thank Martynov for this excellent new formula: "the economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the government." What a pearl! With what inimitable talent and skill in eliminating all partial disagreements and shades of differences among Economists does this clear and concise postulate express the <I>quintessence</I> of Economism: from calling to the workers to join "in the political struggle which they carry on in the general interest, for the purpose of improving the conditions of all the workers,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np80">*</A>]</FONT> continuing through the theory of stages, and ending in the resolution of the Congress on the "most widely applicable," etc. "Economic struggle against the government" is precisely trade-unionist politics, which is very, very far from being Social-Democratic politics.

  "What a large number of Social-Democratic Lomonosovs have appeared among us lately!" observed a comrade one day, having in mind the astonishing propensity of many of those who are inclined towards Economism to arrive, "all by themselves," at great truths (for example, that the economic struggle stimulates the workers to ponder over their lack of rights), and in doing so to ignore, with the supreme

contempt of born geniuses, all that has already been produced by the previous development of revolutionary thought and of the revolutionary movement. Lomonosov-Martynov is precisely such a born genius. Glance at his article, "Immediate Questions," and observe how "all by himself" he <I>approaches</I> what has been said long ago by Axelrod (of whom our Lomonosov, naturally, says not a word); how, for example, he is <I>beginning</I> to understand that we cannot ignore the opposition of the various strata of the bourgeoisie (<I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 9, pp. 61, 62, 71; compare this with the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>'s <I>Reply</I> to Axelrod, pp. 22, 23-24), etc. But alas, he is only "approaching" and is only "beginning," not more than that, for so little has he understood Axelrod's ideas, that he talks about "the economic struggle against the employers and the government." For three years (1898-1901) the<I> Rabocheye Dyelo</I> has tried hard to understand Axelrod, but . . . but has failed to do so yet! Perhaps one of the reasons is that Social-Democracy, "like humanity," always sets itself only tasks that can be achieved? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    But the Lomonosovs are distinguished not only by the fact of their ignorance of many things (that would be half a misfortune!), but also by the fact that they are not conscious of their ignorance. Now this is a real misfortune; and it is this misfortune that prompts them without further ado to attempt to render Plekhanov "more profound."

   "Much water," Lomonosov-Martynov says, "has flowed under the bridges since Plekhanov wrote this book." (<I>Tasks of the Socialists in tbe Fight Against the Famine in Russia</I>.) "The Social-Democrats who for a decade led the economic struggle of the working class . . . have failed as yet to lay down a broad theoretical basis for Party tactics. This question has now come to a head, and if we should wish to lay down such a theoretical basis we would certainly have to deepen considerably the principles of tactics developed at one time by Plekhanov. . . .

present definition of the distinction between propaganda and agitation would have to be different than Plekhanov's." (Martynov had just quoted Plekhanov's words: "A propagandist presents many ideas to one or a few persons; an agitator presents only one or a few ideas, but he presents them to a mass of people.") "By propaganda we would understand the revolutionary elucidation of the whole of the present system or partial manifestations of it, irrespective of whether it is done in a form intelligible to individuals or to broad masses. By agitation, in the strict sense of the word," (<I>sic!</I> ) "we would understand calling the masses to certain concrete actions, facilitating the direct revolutionary intervention of the proletariat in social life."  
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  We congratulate Russian -- and international -- Social-Democracy on this new, Martynov terminology which is more strict and more profound. Up to now we thought (with Plekhanov, and with all the leaders of the international working class movement) that a propagandist, dealing with, say, that same question of unemployment, must explain the capitalistic nature of crises, the reasons why they are inevitable in contemporary society, describe the need for its transformation into socialist society, etc. In a word, he must present "many ideas," so many indeed that they will be understood as an integral whole only by a (comparatively) few persons. An agitator, however, speaking on the same subject, will take as an illustration a fact that is most glaring and most widely known to his audience, say, the death from starvation of the family of an unemployed worker, the growing impoverishment, etc., and utilizing this fact, which is known to all and sundry, will direct all his efforts to presenting <I>a single idea</I> to the "masses," i.e., the idea of the senselessness of the contradiction between the increase of wealth and increase of poverty; he will strive to <I>rouse</I> discontent and indignation among the masses against this crying injustice, and leave a more complete explanation of this contradiction to the propagandist. Consequently, the propagandist operates chiefly by  

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page83 </B></FONT><P>

means of the <I>printed</I> word; the agitator by means of the <I>living</I> word. The propagandist must possess different qualities than the agitator. Kautsky and Lafargue, for example, we call propagandists; Bebel and Guesde we call agitators. To single out a third sphere, or third function, of practical activity, and to include in this function "calling the masses to certain concrete actions," is sheer nonsense, because the "call," as a single act, either naturally and inevitably supplements the theoretical tract, propagandist pamphlet and agitational speech, or represents a purely executive function. Take, for example, the struggle now being carried on by the German Social-Democrats against the grain duties. The theoreticians write research works on tariff policy and "call," say, for a fight for commercial treaties and for free trade. The propagandist does the same thing in the periodical press, and the agitator in public speeches. At the present time, the "concrete action" of the masses takes the form of signing petitions to the Reichstag against the raising of the grain duties. The call for this action comes indirectly from the theoreticians, the propagandists and the agitators, and, directly, from those workers who carry the petition lists to the factories and to private homes soliciting signatures. According to the "Martynov terminology," Kautsky and Bebel are both propagandists, while those who solicit the signatures are agitators; is that not so? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The German example recalled to my mind the German word "Verballhornung," which literally translated means "to Ballhorn." Johann Ballhorn, a Leipzig publisher of the sixteenth century, published a child's reader in which, as was the custom, he introduced a drawing of a cock; but this drawing, instead of portraying an ordinary cock with spurs, portrayed it without spurs and with a couple of eggs Iying near it. On the cover of this reader he printed the legend "<I>Revised</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 84</B></FONT><P>

edition by Johann Ballhorn." Since that time the Germans describe any "revision" that is really a worsening as "Ballhorning." And you cannot help recalling Ballhorn when you see how the Martynovs try to render Plekhanov "more profound." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    Why did our Lomonosov "invent" this confusion? In order to illustrate how the <I>Iskra</I> "devotes attention only to one side of the case, just as Plekhanov did a decade and a half ago" (p. 39). "According to the <I>Iskra</I>, propagandist tasks force agitational tasks into the background, at least for the present" (p. 52). If we translate this last proposition from the language of Martynov into ordinary human language (because humanity has not yet managed to learn the newly invented terminology), we shall get the following: According to the <I>Iskra</I>, the tasks of political propaganda and political agitation force into the background the task of "presenting to the government concrete demands for legislative and administrative measures" that "promise certain palpable results" (or demands for social reforms, that is, if we are permitted just once again to employ the old terminology of old humanity, which has not yet grown to Martynov's level). We suggest that the reader compare this thesis with the following tirade:  

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT SIZE=-1>
   "What also astonishes us in these programs" (the programs advanced by revolutionary Social-Democrats) "is the constant stress that is laid upon the benefits of workers' activity in parliament (non-existent in Russia), though they completely ignore (thanks to their revolutionary nihilism) the importance of workers participating in the legislative manufacturers' assemblies on factory affairs (which do exist in Russia) . . . or at least the importance of workers participating in municipal bodies. . . ."

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  In advancing against the <I>Iskra</I> his "theory" of "raising the activity of the masses of the workers," Martynov, as a matter of fact, betrayed a striving to <I>belittle</I> this activity, because he declared the very economic struggle, before which all Economists have grovelled, to be the preferable, the most important and "the most widely applicable" means of rousing this activity, and the widest field for it. This error is characteristic, precisely because it is by no means peculiar to Martynov alone. As a matter of fact, it is possible to "raise the activity of the masses of the workers" <I>only</I> provided this activity <I>is not restricted</I> to "political agitation on an economic basis." And one of the fundamental conditions for the necessary expansion of political agitation is the organization of <I>comprehensive</I> political exposure. The masses <I>cannot</I> be trained in political consciousness and revolutionary activity in any other way except by means of such exposures. Hence, activity of this kind is one of the most important functions of international Social-Democracy as a whole, for even the existence of political liberty does not in the least remove the necessity for such exposures; it merely changes somewhat the sphere against which they are directed. For example, the German party is especially strengthening its position and spreading its influence, thanks precisely to the untiring energy with which it is conducting a campaign of political exposure. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 86</B></FONT><P>

Working-class consciousness cannot be genuinely political consciousness unless the workers are trained to respond to <I>all</I> cases, <I>without exception</I>, of tyranny, oppression, violence and abuse, no matter <I>what class</I> is affected. Moreover, to respond from a Social-Democratic, and not from any other point of view. The consciousness of the masses of the workers cannot be genuine class consciousness, unless the workers learn to observe from concrete, and above all from topical (current), political facts and events, <I>every</I> other social class and <I>all</I> the manifestations of the intellectual, ethical and political life of these classes; unless they learn to apply in practice the materialist analysis and the materialist estimate of <I>all</I> aspects of the life and activity of <I>all</I> classes, strata and groups of the population. Those who concentrate the attention, observation and consciousness of the working class exclusively, or even mainly, upon itself alone are not Social-Democrats; for its self-realization is indissolubly bound up not only with a fully clear theoretical -- it would be even more true to say not so much with a theoretical, as with a practical understanding, of the relationships between <I>all</I> the various classes of modern society, acquired through experience of political life. That is why the idea preached by our Economists, that the economic struggle is the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into the political movement, is so extremely harmful and extremely reactionary in its practical significance. In order to become a Social-Democrat, the worker must have a clear picture in his mind of the economic nature and the social and political features of the landlord and the priest, the high state official and the peasant, the student and the tramp; he must know their strong and weak points; he must see the meaning of all the catchwords and sophisms by which each class and each stratum 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 87</B></FONT><P>

<I>camouflages</I> its selfish strivings and its real "inside workings"; he must understand what interests certain institutions and certain laws reflect and how they reflect them. But this "clear picture" cannot be obtained from books. It can be obtained only from living examples and from exposures, following hot upon the heels of what is going on around us at a given moment, of what is being discussed, in whispers perhaps, by each one in his own way, of the meaning of such and such events, of such and such statistics, of such and such court sentences, etc., etc., etc. These comprehensive political exposures are an essential and <I>fundamental</I> condition for training the masses in revolutionary activity. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Why is it that the Russian workers as yet display little revolutionary activity in connection with the brutal way in which the police maltreat the people, in connection with the persecution of the religious sects, with the flogging of the peasantry, with the outrageous censorship, the torture of soldiers, the persecution of the most innocent cultural undertakings, etc.? Is it because the "economic struggle" does not "stimulate" them to this, because such activity does not "promise palpable results," because it produces little that is "positive"? No. To advocate such views, we repeat, is merely to lay the blame where it does not belong, to blame the masses of the workers for one's own philistinism (which is also Bernsteinism). We must blame ourselves, our lagging behind the mass movement for being unable as yet to organize sufficiently wide, striking and rapid exposures of all these despicable outrages. When we do that (and we must and can do it), the most backward worker will understand, <I>or will feel</I> that the students and members of religious sects, the muzhiks and the authors are being abused and outraged by the very same dark forces that are oppressing and crushing him at every 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 88</B></FONT><P>

step of his life, and, feeling that, he himself will be filled with an irresistible desire to respond to these things, and then he will organize catcalls against the censors one day, another day he will demonstrate outside the house of a governor who has brutally suppressed a peasant uprising, another day he will teach a lesson to the gendarmes in surplices who are doing the work of the Holy Inquisition, etc. As yet we have done very little, almost nothing, to <I>hurl</I> universal and fresh exposures among the masses of the workers. Many of us as yet do not appreciate the <I>bounden duty</I> that rests upon us, but spontaneously trail in the wake of the "drab everyday struggle," in the narrow confines of factory life. Under such circumstances to say that the "<I>Iskra</I> displays a tendency to minimize the significance of the forward march of the drab everyday struggle in comparison with the propaganda of brilliant and complete ideas" (Martynov, p. 61) -- means dragging the Party backward, defending and glorifying our unpreparedness and backwardness. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   As for calling the masses to action, that will come of itself immediately energetic political agitation, live and striking exposures are set going. To catch some criminal red-handed and immediately to brand him publicly is of itself far more effective than any number of "calls"; the effect very often is such as will make it impossible to tell exactly who it was that "called" on the crowd, and exactly who suggested this or that plan of demonstration, etc. Calls for action, not in the general, but in the concrete sense of the term, can be made only at the place of action; only those who themselves go into action, and do so immediately, can sound such calls. And our business as Social-Democratic publicists is to deepen, to expand and intensify political exposures and political agitation.

We ask: how is the remarkable fact to be explained that although Martynov talks so much about "calls to action," and even suggests "calls to action" as a special form of activity, he said not a word about this call? After <I>this</I>, is not Martynov's allegation, that the <I>Iskra</I> was <I>one-sided</I> because it did not sufficiently "call for" a struggle for demands "promising palpable results," sheer philistinism?

   Our Economists, including the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, were successful because they pandered to the backward workers. But the Social-Democratic worker, the revolutionary worker (and the number of such workers is growing) will indignantly reject all this talk about fighting for demands "promising palpable results," etc., because he will understand that this is only a variation of the old song about adding a kopek to the ruble. Such a worker will say to his counsellors of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> and the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>: you are wasting your time, gentlemen, and shirking your proper duties, by meddling with such excessive zeal in a job that we can very well manage ourselves.

* The demand "to lend the economic struggle itself a political character" most strikingly expresses <I>subservience to spontaneity</I> in the sphere of political activity. Very often the economic struggle <I>spontaneously</I> assumes a political character, that is to say, without the intervention of the "revolutionary bacilli -- the intelligentsia," without the intervention of the class-conscious Social-Democrats. For example, the economic struggle of the British workers also assumed a political character without any intervention of the Socialists. The tasks of the Social-Democrats however, are not exhausted by political agitation on an economic basis their task is to <I>convert</I> trade union politics into Social-Democratic politicai struggle, to <I>utilize</I> the sparks of political consciousness, which the economic struggle generates among the workers, for the purpose of <I>raising</I> them to the level of <I>Social-Democratic</I> political consciousness. The Martynovs however, instead of raising and stimulating the spontaneously awakening political consciousness of the workers, <I>bow to spontaneity</I> and repeat over and over again <I>ad nauseam</I>, that the economic struggle "brings home" to the workers their own lack of political rights. It is unfortunate gentlemen, that the spontaneously awakening trade-unionist political consciousness does not "bring home" to you an understanding of your Social-Democratic tasks!

* To prove that this imaginary speech of a worker to an Economist is based on fact, we shall refer to two witnesses who undoubtedly have direct knowledge of the working-class movement, and who are least of all inclined to be partial towards us "doctrinaires," for one witness is an Economist (who regards even the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> as a political organ!), and the other is a terrorist. The first witness is the author of a remarkably truthful and vivid article entitled "The St. Petersburg Working Class Movement and the Practical Tasks of Social-Democracy," published in the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, No. 6. He divided the workers into the following categories: 1. class-conscious revolutionaries; 2. intermediate stratum; 3. all the rest. Now the intermediate stratum, he says, "is often more interested in questions of political life than in its own immediate economic interests, the connection between which and the general social conditions it has long understood. . . ." The <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> "is sharply criticized": "it keeps on repeating the same thing over and over again, things we have long known, read long ago." "Nothing in the political review again!" (Pp. 30-31.) But even the third stratum, "the younger and more sensitive section of the workers, less corrupted by the tavern and the church, who hardly ever have the opportunity of getting hold of political literature, discuss political events in a rambling way and ponder over the fragmentary news they get about student riots," etc. The terrorist writes as follows: ". . . They read over once or twice the petty details of factory life in other towns, not their own, and then they read no more . . . dull, they find it. . . . To say nothing in a workers' paper about the government . . . is to regard the worker as a small child. . . . The workers are not babies."

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  In the last footnote we quoted the opinion of an Economist and of a non-Social-Democratic terrorist who happened to be in agreement with him. Speaking generally, however, there is not an accidental, but a necessary, inherent connection between the two, about which we shall have to speak further on, but which must be dealt with here in connection with the question of training the masses in revolutionary activity. The Economists and the present-day terrorists have one common root, namely, the <I>worship of spontaneity</I>, which we dealt with in the preceding chapter as a general phenomenon, and which we shall now examine in relation to its effect upon political activity and the political struggle. At first sight, our assertion may appear paradoxical, so great is 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 93</B></FONT><P>

the difference between those who stress the "drab everyday struggle" and those who call for the most self-sacrificing struggle of individuals. But this is no paradox. The Economists and terrorists merely bow to different poles of spontaneity: the Economists bow to the spontaneity of the "pure" working-class movement, while the terrorists bow to the spontaneity of the passionate indignation of intellectuals, who lack the ability or opportunity to link up the revolutionary struggle with the working-class movement, to form an integral whole. It is difficult indeed for those who have lost their belief, or who have never believed that this is possible, to find some outlet for their indignation and revolutionary energy other than terror. Thus, both kinds of worship of spontaneity we have mentioned are nothing more nor less than <I>a beginning in carrying out</I> the notorious <I>Credo</I> program: Let the workers wage their "economic struggle against the employers and the government" (we apologize to the author of the <I>Credo</I> for expressing his views in Martynov's words! We think we have a right to do so because the <I>Credo</I>, too, says that in the economic struggle the workers "come up against the political regime"), and let the intellectuals conduct the political struggle by their own efforts -- with the aid of terror, of course! This is an absolutely logical and inevitable <I>conclusion</I> which must be insisted upon -- <I>even though those</I> who are beginning to carry out this program <I>do not themselves realize</I> that it is inevitable. Political activity has its logic quite apart from the consciousness of those who, with the best intentions, call either for terror or for lending the economic struggle itself a political character. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and, in this case, good intentions cannot save one from being spontaneously drawn "along the line of least resistance," along the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 94</B></FONT><P>

line of the <I>purely bourgeois Credo</I> program. Surely it is no accident either that many Russian liberals -- avowed liberals and those who wear the mask of Marxism -- wholeheartedly sympathize with terror and are trying to keep alive the present wave of terrorist sentiments. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    And the formation of the Revolutionary-Socialist <I>Svoboda</I> Group -- which set itself the aim of helping the working-class movement in every possible way, but which included in its program terror, and emancipation, so to speak, from Social-Democracy -- this fact once again confirmed the remarkable penetration of P. B. Axelrod who <I>literally foretold</I> these results of Social-Democratic wavering <I>as far back as the end of 1897</I> (<I>The Contemporary Tasks and Tactics</I>), when he outlined his remarkable "two perspectives." All the subsequent disputes and disagreements among Russian Social Democrats are contained, like a plant in the seed, in these two perspectives.* 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    From this point of view it also becomes clear why the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, being unable to withstand the spontaneity

* Martynov "conceives of another, more realistic(?) dilemma" (<I>Social-Democracy and the Working Class</I>, p. 19): "Either Social-Democracy takes over the direct leadership of the economic struggle of the proletariat and by that (! ) transforms it into a revolutionary class struggle. . ." "by that," i.e., apparently by the direct leadership of the economic struggle. Can Martynov quote an example where the leadership of the industrial struggle <I>alone</I> has succeeded in transforming a trade union movement into a revolutionary class movement? Cannot he understand that in order to bring about this "transformation" we must actively take up the "direct leadership" of <I>all-sided</I> political agitation? . . . "Or the other prospect: Social-Democracy refrains from taking the leadership of the economic struggle of the workers and so . . . clips its own wings. . . ." In the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>'s opinion, quoted above, it is the Iskra that "refrains." We have seen, however, that the latter <I>does far more</I> to lead the economic struggle <I>than the " Rabocheye Dyelo</I>," but it does not confine itself to this, and <I> does not narrow down</I> its political tasks for the sake of it.

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 95</B></FONT><P>

of Economism, has been unable also to withstand the spontaneity of terrorism. It is highly interesting to note here the specific arguments that the <I>Svoboda</I> advanced in defence of terrorism. It "completely denies" the deterrent role of terrorism (<I>The Regeneration of Revolutionism</I>, p. 64), but instead stresses its "excitative significance." This is characteristic, first, as representing one of the stages of the breakup and decline of the traditional (pre-Social-Democratic) cycle of ideas which insisted upon terrorism. To admit that the government cannot now be "terrified," and therefore disrupted, by terror, is tantamount to thoroughly condemning terror as a system of struggle, as a sphere of activity sanctioned by the program. Secondly, it is still more characteristic as an example of the failure to understand our immediate task of "training the masses in revolutionary activity." The <I>Svoboda</I> advocates terror as a means of "exciting" the working-class movement, and of giving it a "strong impetus." It is difficult to imagine an argument that disproves itself more than this one does! Are there not enough outrages committed in Russian life that special "excitants" have to be invented? On the other hand, is it not obvious that those who are not, and cannot be, roused to excitement even by Russian tyranny will stand by "twiddling their thumbs," watching a handful of terrorists engaged in single combat with the government? The fact of the matter is that the masses of the workers are roused to a high pitch of excitement by the abominations in Russian life, but we are unable to collect, if one may put it that way, and concentrate all these drops and streamlets of popular excitement, which are called forth by the conditions of Russian life to a far larger extent than we imagine, but which it is precisely necessary to combine into a <I>single</I> gigantic torrent. That this can be accomplished is 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 96</B></FONT><P>

irrefutably proved by the enormous growth of the working-class movement and the eagerness with which the workers clamour for political literature, to which we have already referred above. On the other hand, calls for terror and calls to lend the economic struggle itself a political character are merely two different forms of <I>evading</I> the most pressing duty that now rests upon Russian revolutionaries, namely, to organize comprehensive political agitation. The <I>Svoboda</I> desires to <I>substitute</I> terror for agitation, openly admitting that "as soon as intensified and strenuous agitation is commenced among the masses the excitative function of terror will be finished." (<I>The Regeneration of Revolutionism</I>, p. 68.) This is exactly what proves that both the terrorists and the Economists <I>underestimate</I> the revolutionary activity of the masses, in spite of the striking evidence of the events that took place in the spring,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np96">*</A>]</FONT> and whereas the former go out in search of artificial "excitants," the latter talk about "concrete demands." But both fail to devote sufficient attention to the development of <I>their own activity</I> in political agitation and in the organization of political exposures. And no other work can serve as a <I>substitute</I> for this work either at the present time or at any other time.

<I>most urgently</I> necessary, task of activity, that is, if that activity is to be truly Social-Democratic. However, we arrived at this conclusion <I>solely</I> on the grounds of the pressing needs of the working class for political knowledge and political training. But presenting the question in this way alone is too narrow, for it ignores the general democratic tasks of Social-Democracy in general, and of present-day Russian Social-Democracy in particular. In order to explain the point more concretely we shall approach the subject from an aspect that is "nearest" to the Economist, namely, from the practical aspect. "Everyone agrees" that it is necessary to develop the political consciousness of the working class. The question is, <I>how</I> is that to be done, what is required to do it? The economic struggle merely "brings home" to the workers questions concerning the attitude of the government towards the working class. Consequently, <I>however much we may try</I> to "lend the economic struggle itself a political character" <I>we shall never be able</I> to develop the political consciousness of the workers (to the level of Social-Democratic political consciousness) by keeping within the framework of the economic struggle, for that <I>framework is too narrow</I>. The Martynov formula has some value for us, and not because it illustrates Martynov's ability to confuse things, but because it strikingly expresses the fundamental error that all the Economists commit, namely, their conviction that it is possible to develop the class political consciousness of the workers <I>from within</I>, so to speak, their economic struggle, i.e., making this struggle the exclusive (or, at least, the main) starting point, making it the exclusive, or, at least, the main basis. Such a view is fundamentally wrong. Just because the Economists are piqued by our polemics against them, they refuse to ponder deeply over the origins of these disagreements, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 98</B></FONT><P>

with the result that we absolutely fail to understand each other. It is as if we spoke in different tongues. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Class political consciousness can be brought to the workers <I>only from without</I>, that is, only from outside of the economic struggle, from outside of the sphere of relations between workers and employers. The sphere from which alone it is possible to obtain this knowledge is the sphere of relationships between <I>all</I> the classes and strata and the state and the government, the sphere of the interrelations between <I>all</I> the classes. For that reason, the reply to the question as to what must be done to bring political knowledge to the workers cannot be merely the answer with which, in the majority of cases, the practical workers, especially those inclined towards Economism, mostly content themselves, namely: "To go among the workers." To bring political knowledge to the workers the Social-Democrats must <I>go among all classes of the population</I>, must dispatch units of their army <I>in all directions</I>.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   We deliberately select this awkward formula, we deliberately express ourselves in a simplified, blunt way -- not because we desire to indulge in paradoxes, but in order to "bring home" to the Economists those tasks which they unpardonably ignore, to make them understand the difference between trade-unionist and Social-Democratic politics, which they refuse to understand. We therefore beg the reader not to get excited, but to listen patiently to the end. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Take the type of Social-Democratic that has become most widespread in the past few years, and examine its work. It has "contacts with the workers," and rests content with this, issuing leaflets in which abuses in the factories, the government's partiality towards the capitalist and the tyranny of the police are strongly condemned. At meetings of work-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 99</B></FONT><P>

ers the discussions never, or rarely, go beyond the limits of these subjects. Lectures and discussions on the history of the revolutionary movement, on questions of the home and foreign policy of our government, on questions of the economic evolution of Russia and of Europe, and the position of the various classes in modern society, etc., are extremely rare. As to systematically acquiring and extending contact with other classes of society, no one even dreams of that. In fact the ideal leader, as the majority of the members of such circles picture him, is something far more in the nature of a trade union secretary than a socialist political leader. For the trade union secretary of any, say British trade union, always helps the workers to conduct the economic struggle, helps to expose factory abuses, explains the injustice of the laws and of measures which hamper the freedom to strike and the freedom to picket (i.e., to warn all and sundry that a strike is proceeding at a certain factory), explains the partiality of arbitration court judges who belong to the bourgeois classes, etc., etc. In a word, every trade union secretary conducts and helps to conduct "the economic struggle against the employers and the government." It cannot be too strongly insisted that <I>this is not yet</I> Social-Democracy. The Social-Democratic ideal should not be a trade union secretary, but <I>a tribune of the people</I>, able to react to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression, no matter where it takes place, no matter what stratum or class of the people it affects; he must be able to generalize all these manifestations to produce a single picture of police violence and capitalist exploitation; he must be able to take advantage of every event, however small, in order to explain his Socialistic convictions and his democratic demands to <I>all</I>, in order to explain to <I>all</I> and everyone the world-historic significance of the proletariat's 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 100</B></FONT><P>

struggle for emancipation. Compare, for example, a leader like Robert Knight (the well-known secretary and leader of the Boiler-Makers' Society, one of the most powerful trade unions in England), with Wilhelm Liebknecht, and try to apply to them the contrasts that Martynov draws in his controversy with the <I>Iskra</I>. You will see -- I am running through Martynov's article -- that Robert Knight engaged more in "calling the masses to certain concrete actions" (p. 39) while Wilhelm Liebknecht engaged more in "the revolutionary elucidation of the whole of the present system or partial manifestations of it" (pp. 38-39); that Robert Knight "formulated the immediate demands of the proletariat and indicated the means by which they can be achieved" (p. 41), whereas Wilhelm Liebknecht, while doing this, was not averse "simultaneously to guide the activities of various opposition strata," "dictate a positive program of action for them"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np100">*</A>]</FONT> (p. 41); that it was precisely Robert Knight who strove "as far as possible to lend the economic struggle itself a political character" (p. 42) and was excellently able "to submit to the government concrete demands promising certain palpable results" (p. 43), while Liebknecht engaged to a much greater degree in "one-sided" "exposures" (p. 40); that Robert Knight attached more significance to the "forward march of the drab, everyday struggle" (p. 61), while Liebknecht attached more significance to the "propaganda of brilliant and finished ideas" (p. 6I); that Liebknecht converted the paper he was directing into "an organ of revolutionary opposition that exposes the state of affairs in our country, particularly the political state of affairs, in so far as it affects the interests 

<A NAME="np100">

* For example, during the Franco-Prussian War, Liebknecht dictated a program of action <I>for the whole of democracy</I> -- and this was done to an even greater extent by Marx and Engels in 1848.

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 101</B></FONT><P>

of the most varied strata of the population" (p. 63), whereas Robert Knight "worked for the cause of the working class in close organic contact with the proletarian struggle" (p. 63) --  if by "close and organic contact" is meant the worship of spontaneity which we examined above using the example of Krichevsky and Martynov -- and "restricted the sphere of his influence," convinced, of course, as is Martynov, that "by doing so he intensified that influence" (p. 63). In a word, you will see that <I>de facto</I> Martynov reduces Social-Democracy to the level of trade unionism, though he does so, of course, not because he does not desire the good of Social-Democracy, but simply because he is a little too much in a hurry to render Plekhanov more profound, instead of taking the trouble to understand him. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Let us return, however, to our thesis. We said that a Social-Democrat, if he really believes it is necessary to develop comprehensively the political consciousness of the proletariat, must "go amomg all classes of the population." This gives rise to the questions: How is this to be done? Have we enough forces to do this? Is there a basis for such work among all the other classes? Will this not mean a retreat, or lead to a retreat, from the class point of view? Let us deal with these questions. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   We must "go among all classes of the population" as theoreticians, as propagandists, as agitators and as organizers. No one doubts that the theoretical work of Social-Democrats should aim at studying all the features of the social and political position of the various classes. But extremely little, little beyond proportion, is done in this direction as compared with the work that is done in studying the features of factory life. In the committees and circles, you will meet people who are immersed even in the study of, say, some special 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 102</B></FONT><P>

branch of the metal industry, but you will hardly ever find members of organizations (obliged, as often happens, for some reason or other to give up practical work) especially engaged in the collection of material concerning some pressing question of social and political life in our country which could serve as a means for conducting Social-Democratic work among other strata of the population. In speaking of the lack of training of the majority of present-day leaders of the working-class movement, we cannot refrain from mentioning the point about training in this connection also, for it too is bound up with the "economic" conception of "close organic contact with the proletarian struggle." The principal thing, of course, is <I>propaganda</I> and <I>agitation</I> among all strata of the people. The work of the West-European Social Democrat is in this respect facilitated by the public meetings and rallies, to which all are free to go, and by the fact that in parliament he addresses the representatives of <I>all</I> classes. We have neither a parliament nor freedom of assembly, nevertheless we are able to arrange meetings of workers who desire to listen to <I>a Social-Democrat</I>. We must also find ways and means of calling meetings of representatives of all classes of the population that desire to listen to <I>a democrat</I>; for he is no Social-Democrat who forgets that "the Communists support every revolutionary movement," that we are obliged for that reason to expound and emphasize <I>general democratic tasks before the whole people</I>, without for a moment concealing our socialist convictions. He is no Social Democrat who forgets his obligation to be <I>ahead of everybody</I> in advancing, accentuating and solving <I>every</I> general democratic problem. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   "But everybody agrees with this!" -- the impatient reader will exclaim -- and the new instructions adopted by the last 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 103</B></FONT><P>

Congress of the Union for the editorial board of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> definitely say: "All events of social and political life that affect the proletariat either directly as a special class or <I>as the vanguard of all the revolutionary forces in the struggle for freedom</I> should serve as subjects for political propaganda and agitation." (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 17, our italics.) Yes, these are very true and very good words and we would be fully satisfied if the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo understood</I> them <I>and if it refrained from saying in the next breath things that are the very opposite of them</I>. For it is not enough to call ourselves the "vanguard," the advanced detachment; we must act like one; we must act in such a way that <I>all</I> the other detachments shall see us, and be obliged to admit, that we are marching in the vanguard. And we ask the reader: Are the representatives of the other "detachments" such fools as to take our word for it when we say that we are the "vanguard"? Just picture to yourselves the following: A Social-Democrat comes to the "detachment" of Russian educated radicals, or liberal constitutionalists, and says: We are the vanguard; "the task confronting us now is, as far as possible, to lend the economic struggle itself a political character." The radical, or constitutionalist, if he is at all intelligent (and there are many intelligent men among Russian radicals and constitutionalists), would only laugh at such a speech, and would say (to himself, of course, for in the majority of cases he is an experienced diplomat): "Your 'vanguard' must be made up of simpletons! They do not even understand that it is our task, the task of the progressive representatives of bourgeois democracy to lend the workers' economic struggle <I>itself</I> a political character. Why, we too, like all the West-European bourgeoisie, want to draw the workers into politics, but <I>precisely into trade-unionist</I>, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 104</B></FONT><P>

<I>and not Social-Democratic politics</I>. Trade-unionist politics of the working class are precisely <I>bourgeois politics</I> of the working class and the 'vanguard's' formulation of its tasks is the formula for trade-unionist politics. Let them even call themselves Social-Democrats to their heart's content, I am not a child to get excited over a label. But they must not fall under the influence of those pernicious orthodox doctrinaires, let them allow 'freedom of criticism' to those who are unconsciously driving Social-Democracy into trade unionist channels." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   And the light chuckle of our constitutionalst will turn into Homeric laughter when he learns that the Social-Democrats who talk about Social-Democracy being the vanguard at the present time, when spontaneity almost completely dominates our movement, fear nothing so much as "belittling the spontaneous elements," as "belittling the significance of the forward march of the drab, everyday struggle, as compared with the propaganda of brilliant and finished ideas," etc., etc.! A "vanguard" which fears that consciousness will outstrip spontaneity, which fears to put forward a bold "plan" that would compel universal recognition even among those who think differently from us. Are you no confusing the word "vanguard" with the word "rearguard"?  

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Ponder over following piece of Martynov reasoning. On page 40 he says that the <I>Iskra</I>'s tactics of exposing abuses are one-sided, that "however much we may spread distrust and hatred towards the government, we shall not achieve our aim until we have succeeded in developing sufficiently active social energy for its overthrow." This, it may be said in parenthesis, is the concern, with which we are already familiar, for increasing the activity of the masses, while at the same time striving to restrict one's own activity. But 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 105</B></FONT><P>

that is not the main point just now. Martynov, therefore, speaks here of <I>revolutionary</I> energy ("for overthrowing"). And what conclusion does he arrive at? Since in ordinary times various social strata inevitably march separately, "it is, therefore, clear that we Social-Democrats cannot simultaneously guide the activities of various opposition strata, we cannot dictate to them a positive program of action, we cannot point out to them in what manner they should fight for their daily interests. . . . The liberal strata will themselves take care of the active struggle for their immediate interests and that struggle will bring them face to face with our political regime." (P. 41.) Thus, having commenced with talk about revolutionary energy, about the active struggle for the overthrow of the autocracy, Martynov immediately turns towards trade union energy and active struggle for immediate interests! It goes without saying that we cannot guide the struggle of the students, liberals, etc., for their "immediate interests," but this was not the point at issue, most worthy Economist! The point we were discussing was the possible and necessary participation of various social strata in the overthrow of the autocracy; and not only are we <I>able</I>, but it is our bounden duty, to guide <I>these</I> "activities of the various opposition strata" if we desire to be the "vanguard." Not only will our students and liberals, etc., themselves take care of "the struggle that will bring them face to face with our political regime"; the police and the officials of the autocratic government will see to this more than anyone else. But if "we" desire to be advanced democrats, we must make it our business to <I>stimulate</I> in the minds of those who are dissatisfied with university, or only with Zemstvo, etc. conditions the idea that the whole political system is worthless. <I>We</I> must take upon ourselves the task of organizing an all-round 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 106</B></FONT><P>

political struggle under the leadership of our Party in such a manner as to obtain all the support possible of all opposition strata for the struggle and for our Party. We must train our Social-Democratic practical workers to become political leaders, able to guide all the manifestations of this all-round struggle, able at the right time to "dictate a positive program of action" for the restless students, the discontented Zemstvo Councillors, the incensed religious sects, the offended elementary schoolteachers, etc., etc. For that reason, Martynov's assertion is <I>absolutely wrong</I> -- that "with regard to these, we can come forward <I>merely in the negative</I> role of exposers of abuses . . . we can <I>only</I>" (our italics) "dissipate the hopes they have in various government commissions." By saying this Martynov shows that <I>he understands absolutely nothing</I> about the role that the revolutionary "vanguard" must really play. If the reader bears this in mind, he will be clear as to the <I>real meaning</I> of Martynov's following concluding remarks: "The <I>Iskra</I> is an organ of revolutionary opposition that exposes the state of affairs in our country, particularly the political state of affairs in so far as it affects the interests of the most varied strata of the population. We, however, work and shall continue to work for the cause of the working class in close organic contact with the proletarian struggle. By narrowing down the sphere of our active influence, we make it more complicated to exercise that influence." (P. 63.) The true meaning of this conclusion is as follows: the <I>Iskra</I> desires to <I>elevate</I> the trade-unionist politics of the working class (to which, owing to misunderstanding, lack of training, or by conviction, our practical workers frequently confine themselves) to Social-Democratic politics, whereas the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> desires to <I>degrade</I> Social-Democratic politics to trade unionist politics. And, what is more, it assures the world 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 107</B></FONT><P> <A NAME="p107">

that these positions are "quite compatible within the common cause" (p. 63). <I> O, Sancta simplicitas</I> ! <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n68">68</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   To proceed: Have we sufficient forces to direct our propaganda and agitation among <I>all</I> classes of the population? Of course we have. Our Economists, frequently inclined as they are to deny this, lose sight of the gigantic progress our movement has made from 1894 (approximately) to 1901. Like real "tail-enders," they frequently live in the distant past, in the period when the movement was just beginning. At that time, indeed, we had astonishingly few forces, and it was perfectly natural and legitimate then to devote ourselves exclusively to activities among the workers, and severely condemn any deviation from this. The whole task then was to consolidate our position in the working class. At the present time, however, gigantic forces have been attracted to the movement; the best representatives of the young generation of the educated classes are coming over to us; all over the country there are people, compelled to live in the provinces, who have taken part in the movement in the past or who desire to do so now, who are gravitating towards Social-Democracy (whereas in 1894 you could count the Social-Democrats on your fingers). One of the principal political and organizational shortcomings of our movement is that we <I>do not know how</I> to utilize all these forces and give them appropriate work (we shall deal with this in greater detail in the next chapter). The overwhelming majority of these forces entirely lack the opportunity of "going among the workers," so there are no grounds for fearing that we shall deflect forces from our main work. And in order to be able to provide the workers with real, comprehensive and live political knowledge, we must have "our own people," Social-Democrats, everywhere, among all social strata, and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 108</B></FONT><P>

in all positions from which we can learn the inner springs of our state mechanism. Such people are required not only for propaganda and agitation, but in a still larger measure for organization. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    Is there scope for activity among all classes of the population? Those who fail to see this also lag, in their consciousness, behind the spontaneous awakening of the masses. The working-class movement has aroused and is continuing to arouse discontent in some, hopes for support for the opposition in others, and the consciousness of the intolerableness and inevitable downfall of the autocracy in still others. We would be "politicians" and Social-Democrats only in name (as actually very often happens), if we failed to realize that our task is to utilize every manifestation of discontent, and to collect and make the best of every grain of even rudimentary protest. This is quite apart from the fact that many millions of the labouring peasantry, handicraftsmen, petty artisans, etc., would always listen eagerly to the preachings of any at all able and intelligent Social-Democrat. Indeed, is there a single class of the population in which no individuals, groups or circles are to be found who are discontented with the lack of rights and with tyranny and, therefore, accessible to the propaganda of Social-Democrats as the spokesmen of the most pressing general democratic needs? To those who desire to have a clear idea of what the political agitation of a Social-Democrat <I>among all</I> classes and strata of the population should be like, we would point to <I>political exposures</I> in the broad sense of the word as the principal (but of course not the sole) form of this agitation.

   "We must arouse in every section of the population that is at all enlightened a passion for <I>political</I> exposure," I wrote in my article "<A HREF="WTB01.html">Where To Begin</A>?" (<I>Iskra</I>, No. 4, May 1901), with which I shall deal in greater

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 109</B></FONT><P> <A NAME="p109">

<FONT SIZE=-1>
detail later. "We must not be discouraged by the fact that the voice of political exposure is at present feeble, rare and timid. <A NAME="p109a"> This is not because of a wholesale submission to police despotism, but because those who are able and ready to make exposures have no tribune from which to speak, no audience to listen eagerly and approve what the speakers say, and because the latter do not see anywhere among the people forces to whom it would be worth while directing their complaint against the 'omnipotent' Russian government. . . . We are now in a position, and it is our duty, to provide a tribune for the nation-wide exposure of the tsarist government. That tribune must be a Social-Democratic paper."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n69">69</A>]</FONT></FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  The ideal audience for political exposures is the working class, which is first and foremost in need of all-round and live political knowledge, and is most capable of converting this knowledge into active struggle, even if it does not promise "palpable results." And the tribune for <I>nation-wide</I> exposures can be only an all-Russian newspaper. "Without a political organ, a political movement deserving that name is inconceivable in modern Europe," and in this respect Russia must undoubtedly be included in modern Europe. The press has long ago become a power in our country, otherwise the government would not spend tens of thousands of rubles to bribe it, and to subsidize the Katkovs and Meshcherskys. And it is no novelty in autocratic Russia for the underground press to break through the wall of censorship and <I>compel</I> the legal and conservative press to speak openly of it. This was the case in the 'seventies and even in the 'fifties. How much broader and deeper are now those sections of the people that are prepared to read the illegal underground press, and to learn from it "how to live and how to die," to use the expression of a worker who sent a letter to the <I>Iskra</I> (No. 7).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n70">70</A>]</FONT> Political exposures are as much a declaration of war against the <I>government</I> as economic exposures are a declaration of war against the factory owners. And the moral signif-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 110</B></FONT><P>

icance of this declaration of war will be all the greater, the wider and more powerful this campaign of exposure is, the more numerous and determined the social <I>class</I>, which has <I>declared war in order to commence the war</I>. Hence, political exposures in themselves serve as a powerful instrument for <I>disintegrating</I> the system we oppose, a means for diverting from the enemy his casual or temporary allies, a means for spreading enmity and distrust among the permanent partners of the autocracy. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Only a party that will <I>organize</I> really <I>nation-wide</I> exposures can become the vanguard of the revolutionary forces in our time. The word "nation-wide" has a very profound meaning. The overwhelming majority of the non-working-class exposers (and in order to become the vanguard, we must attract other classes) are sober politicians and level-headed businessmen. They know perfectly well how dangerous it is to "complain" even against a minor official, let alone against the "omnipotent" Russian government. And they will come <I>to us</I> with their complaints only when they see that these complaints can really have effect, and that we represent a <I>political force</I>. In order to become such a force in the eyes of outsiders, much persistent and stubborn work is required to <I>raise</I> our own consciousness, initiative and energy. To accomplish this it is not enough to attach a "vanguard" label on rearguard theory and practice. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   But if we have to undertake the organization of really nation-wide exposure of the government, what, then, will be the expression of the class character of our movement? -- the over-zealous advocates of "close organic contact with the proletarian struggle" will ask us. The reply is: the fact that we Social-Democrats will organize these public exposures; that all the questions raised by the agitation will be  

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 111</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;

elucidated in a consistently Social-Democratic spirit, without any concessions to deliberate or non-deliberate distortions of Marxism; in the fact that this all-round political agitation will be conducted by a party which unites into one inseparable whole the pressure upon the government in the name of the whole people, the revolutionary training of the proletariat, while safeguarding its political independence, and guidance of the economic struggle of the working class, the utilization of all its spontaneous conflicts with its exploiters which rouse and bring into our camp increasing numbers of the proletariat! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   But one of the most characteristic features of Economism is its failure to understand this connection, more, this identity of the most pressing needs of the proletariat (a comprehensible political education through the medium of political agitation and political exposures) with the needs of the general democratic movement. This lack of understanding is expressed not only in "Martynovite" phrases, but also in the references to a supposedly class point of view which is identical in meaning with these phrases. Here, for example, is how it is put by the authors of the "Economist" letter in No. 12 of the <I>Iskra</I>.* "This fundamental defect of the <I>Iskra </I>" (overestimating ideology) "is the cause of its inconsistency in the question of the attitude of Social-Democrats to various social classes and tendencies. By a process of theoretical

&nbsp; &nbsp;
* Lack of space has prevented us from replying in full, in the <I>Iskra</I>, to this letter, which is extremely characteristic of the Economists. We were very glad it appeared, for rumours about the <I>Iskra</I> not maintaining a consistent, class point of view, have reached us long ago from various sources, and we have been waiting for an appropriate opportunity, or for a formulated expression of this current charge, to reply to it. And it is our habit to reply to attacks not by defence, but by counter-attacks.

reasoning" (and not by "the growth of Party tasks, which grow together with the Party"), "the <I>Iskra</I> solved the problem of immediately proceeding to the struggle against absolutism. But in all probability it senses how difficult a task this would be for the workers in the present state of affairs" . . . (not only senses, but knows perfectly well that this task appears less difficult to the workers than to those "Economist" intellectuals who are concerned about little children, for the workers are prepared to fight even for demands which, to use the language of the never-to-be-forgotten Martynov, do not "promise palpable results") . . . "and lacking the patience to wait until the workers accumulate more strength for this struggle, the <I>Iskra</I> begins to search for allies in the ranks of the liberals and intelligentsia". . . . 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Yes, yes, we have indeed lost all "patience" to "wait" for the blessed time that has long been promised us by diverse "conciliators" when the Economists will stop throwing the blame for their own backwardness upon the workers, and stop justifying their <I>own</I> lack of energy by alleging that it is the workers who lack strength. We ask our Economists: what does "the working class accumulating more strength for this struggle" mean? Is it not evident that it means the political training of the workers, exposing to them <I>all</I> the aspects of our despicable autocracy? And is it not clear that <I>precisely for this work</I> we need "allies in the ranks of the liberals and intelligentsia," who are prepared to join us in the exposure of the political attack on the Zemstvos, on the teachers, on the statisticians, on the students, etc.? Is this surprisingly "intricate mechanism" really so difficult to understand? Has not P. B. Axelrod repeated to you over and over again since 1897: "The problem of the Russian Social-Democrats acquiring adherents and direct and indirect  

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 113</B></FONT><P>

allies among the non-proletarian classes will be solved principally and primarily by the character of the propagandist activities conducted among the proletariat itself"? But the Martynovs and the other Economists continue to imagine that "by economic struggle against the employers and the government," the workers must <I>first</I> accumulate strength (for trade-unionist politics) and <I>then</I> "go over" -- we presume from trade-unionist "training for activity" -- to Social-Democratic activity! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   ". . . In its quest," continue the Economists, "the <I>Iskra</I> not infrequently departs from the class point of view, obscures class antagonisms and puts into the forefront the general character of the prevailing discontent with the government, notwithstanding the fact that the causes and the degree of this discontent vary quite considerably among the 'allies.' Such, for example, is the <I>Iskra</I>'s attitude towards the Zemstvo. . . ." <A NAME="p113"> The <I>Iskra</I>, it is alleged, "promises the nobility, who are discontented with the government's sops, the aid of the working class, but does not say a word about the class antagonisms between these strata of the population." If the reader will turn to the articles "The Autocracy and the Zemstvo" (Nos. 2 and 4 of the <I>Iskra</I>), to which, <I>in all probability</I>, the authors of the letter refer, he will find that these articles<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n71">71</A>]</FONT> deal with the attitude of the <I>government</I> towards the "mild agitation of the bureaucratic Zemstvo, which is based on the Estates," and towards the "independent activity of even the propertied classes." In these articles it is stated that the workers cannot look on indifferently while the government is carrying on a fight against the Zemstvo, and the Zemstvo-ites are called upon to give up making mild speeches, and to speak firmly and resolutely when revolutionary Social-Democracy confronts the government in all its strength. What 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 114</B></FONT><P>

the authors of the letter do not agree with here is not clear. Do they think that the workers will "not understand" the phrases "propertied classes" and "bureaucratic Zemstvo based on the Estates"? Do they think that <I>urging</I> the Zemstvo to abandon mild speeches and to speak firmly and resolutely is "overestimating ideology"? Do they imagine the workers can "accumulate strength" for the fight against absolutism if they know nothing about the attitude of absolutism <I>also</I> towards the Zemstvo? All this too remains unknown. One thing alone is clear and that is that the authors of the letter have a very vague idea of what the political tasks of Social-Democracy are. This is revealed still more clearly by their remark: "Such also" (i.e., also "obscures class antagonisms") "is the <I>Iskra</I>'s attitude towards the student movement." Instead of calling upon the workers to declare by means of public demonstrations that the real centre of unbridled violence, disorder and outrage is not the students but the Russian government (<I>Iskra</I>, No. 2 <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n72">72</A>]</FONT>), we should, no doubt, have inserted arguments in the spirit of the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> ! And such ideas are expressed by Social-Democrats in the autumn of 1901, after the events of February and March, on the eve of a fresh revival of the student movement, which reveals that even in this sphere the "spontaneous" protest against the autocracy is <I>outstripping</I> the conscious Social-Democratic leadership of the movement. The spontaneous striving of the workers to stand up for the students who are being beaten up by the police and the Cossacks is outstripping the conscious activity of the Social-Democratic organization! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   "And yet in other articles," continue the authors of the letter, "the <I>Iskra</I> sharply condemns all compromises, and defends, for example, the intolerant conduct of the Guesdites." We would advise those who usually so conceitedly and friv-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 115</B></FONT><P>

olously declare in connection with the disagreements existing among the contemporary Social-Democrats that they are of a minor nature and do not justify a split, to ponder very deeply over these words. Is it possible to have successful activity, within one organization, by people who say that so far we have done astonishingly little to explain the hostility of the autocracy towards the various classes, and to inform the workers of the opposition of the various strata of the population towards the autocracy, and by people who see in this a "compromise" -- evidently a compromise with the theory of the "economic struggle against the employers and the government"?

   We urged the necessity of introducing the class struggle in the rural districts on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the emancipation of the peasantry (No. 3 <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n73">73</A>]</FONT>), and spoke of the irreconcilability between the local government bodies and the autocracy in connection with Witte's secret memorandum.

  These polite expressions, as the reader will recall, belong to the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I>, which in this way answers our charge that it "is indirectly preparing the ground for converting the working-class movement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy." In its simplicity of heart the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> decided that this accusation was nothing more than a polemical sally, as if to say, these malicious doctrinaires have 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 117</B></FONT><P>

made up their minds to say all sorts of unpleasant things about us; now what can be more unpleasant than being an instrument of bourgeois democracy? And so they print in bold type a "refutation": "Nothing but downright slander" (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 30), "mystification" (p. 31), "masquerade" (p. 33). Like Jupiter, the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> (although it has little resemblance to Jupiter) is angry because it is wrong, and proves by its hasty abuse that it is incapable of understanding its opponents' mode of reasoning. And yet, with only a little reflection it would have understood why <I>all</I> worship of the spontaneity of the mass movement and <I>any</I> degrading of Social-Democratic politics to trade-unionist politics mean precisely preparing the ground for converting the working-class movement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy. The spontaneous working-class movement by itself is able to create (and inevitably creates) only trade unionism, and working-class trade-unionist politics are precisely working-class bourgeois politics. The fact that the working class participates in the political struggle, and even in political revolution, does not in itself make its politics Social-Democratic politics. Will the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> make bold to deny that? Will it, at long last, publicly, plainly and without equivocation explain just how it understands the urgent questions of the international and of the Russian Social-Democratic movement? Oh no, it will never pluck up the courage to do anything of the kind, because it holds fast to the trick, which might be described as saying "no" to everything: "It's not me; it's not my horse; I'm not the driver. We are not Economists; the <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> does not stand for Economism; there is no Economism at all in Russia." This is a remarkably adroit and "political" trick, which suffers from the slight defect, however, that the publications

practising it are usually nicknamed "Anything you wish, sir." 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> imagines that in general bourgeois democracy in Russia is merely a "phantom" (<I>Two Congresses</I>, p. 32).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#np118">*</A>]</FONT> Happy people! Like the ostrich, they bury their heads in the sand, and imagine that everything around has disappeared. Liberal publicists who month after month proclaim to the world their triumph over the collapse and even disappearance of Marxism; liberal newspapers (the <I>S. Peterburgskiye Vedomosti</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n78">78</A>]</FONT> the </I>Russkiye Vedomosti</I>, and many others) which encourage the liberals who bring to the workers the Brentano<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="WD02i.html#n79">79</A>]</FONT> conception of the class struggle and the trade-unionist conception of politics; the galaxy of critics of Marxism, whose real tendencies were so very well disclosed by the <I>Credo</I> and whose literary products alone circulate in Russia without let or hindrance; the revival of revolutionary <I>non</I>-Social-Democratic tendencies, particularly after the February and March events -- all these, apparently, are just phantoms! All these have nothing at all to do with bourgeois democracy! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> and the authors of the Economist letter published in the <I>Iskra</I>, No. 12, should "ponder over the reason why the events of the spring brought about such a revival of revolutionary non-Social-Democratic tendencies

* There follows a reference to the "concrete Russian conditions which fatalistically impel the working-class movement onto the revolutionary path." But these people refuse to understand that the revolutionary path of the working-class movement might not be a Social-Democratic path! When absolutism reigned, the entire West-European bourgeoisie "impelled," deliberately impelled, the workers onto the path of revolution. We Social-Democrats, however, cannot be satisfied with that. And if we, by any means whatever, degrade Social-Democratic politics to the level of spontaneous trade-unionist politics, we, by that, play into the hands of bourgeois democracy.

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 119</B></FONT><P>

instead of increasing the authority and the prestige of Social-Democracy" The reason was that we were not up to the tasks confronting us. The masses of the workers proved to be more active than we; we lacked adequately trained revolutionary leaders and organizers with a thorough knowledge of the mood prevailing among all the opposition strata and able to march at the head of the movement, turn a spontaneous demonstration into a political one, broaden its political character, etc. Under such circumstances, our backwardness will inevitably be utilized by the more mobile and more energetic non-Social-Democratic revolutionaries, and the workers, no matter how strenuously and self-sacrificingly they may fight the police and the troops, no matter how revolutionary their actions may be, will prove to be merely a force supporting these revolutionaries, the rearguard of bourgeois democracy, and not the Social-Democratic vanguard. Take, for example, the German Social-Democrats, whose weak aspects alone our Economists desire to emulate. Why is it that <I>not a single</I> political event takes place in Germany without adding to the authority and prestige of Social-Democracy? Because Social-Democracy is always found to be in advance of all others in that it furnishes the most revolutionary appraisal of every given event and by its championship of every protest against tyranny. It does not lull itself with disquisitions about the economic struggle bringing the workers up against their own lack of rights and about concrete conditions fatalistically impelling the working-class movement onto the path of revolution. It intervenes in every sphere and in every question of social and political life: in the matter of Wilhelm's refusal to endorse a bourgeois progressive as city mayor (our Economists have not yet managed to convince the Germans that this, in fact, is a compromise with 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 120</B></FONT><P>

liberalism!); in the question of the law against "immoral" publications and pictures; in the question of the government influencing the election of professors, etc., etc. Everywhere the Social-Democrats are found to be ahead of all others, rousing political discontent among all classes, rousing the sluggards, pushing on the laggards and providing a wealth of material for the development of the political consciousness and political activity of the proletariat. The result of all this is that even the avowed enemies of Socialism are filled with respect for this advanced political fighter, and not unfrequently an important document from bourgeois, and even from bureaucratic and Court circles, makes its way by some miraculous means into the editorial office of the <I>Vorw&aumlrts</I>. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   This, then, is the explanation of the seeming "contradiction" which is so much beyond the understanding of the <I>Rabocheye Dyelo</I> that it raises its arms and cries: "Masquerade!" Indeed, just think of it: We, the Rabocheye Dyelo, regard the mass working-class movement as the <B>cornerstone</B> (and say so in bold type!); we warn all and sundry against belittling the significance of the spontaneous movement; we desire to lend the economic struggle itself, itself, itself, a political character; we desire to maintain close and organic contact with the proletarian struggle! And yet we are told that we are preparing the ground for converting the working class movement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy! And who says this? People who "compromise" with liberalism, intervene in every "liberal" issue (what a gross misunderstanding of "organic contact with the proletarian struggle"!), who devote so much attention to the students and even (Oh horror!) to the Zemstvo-ites! People who wish to devote a greater (compared with the Economists) percent-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 121</B></FONT><P>

age of their efforts to activity among non-proletarian classes of the population! Is not this a "masquerade"? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Poor <I>Rabocheye Dyelo </I>! Will it ever find the solution to this complicated puzzle?

   <I>What Is To Be Done?</I> <I>Burning Questions of Our Movement</I> -- a book written by Lenin in the latter part of 1901 and in the beginning of 1902. In "<A HREF="WTB01.html">Where To Begin</A>?", published in the <I>Iskra</I>, No. 4 (May 1901), Lenin wrote that the article represents "the outlines of a plan which is described in greater detail in a pamphlet now in preparation for the press." 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Lenin began the actual writing of the book in the autumn of 1901. In his "Preface to 'Documents of the "Unity" Congress,'" written in November 1901, Lenin stated that the book "was in preparation and would appear at an early date." Lenin subsequently described his article, "A Conversation with the Advocates of Economism" (<I>Iskra</I>, No. 12, December 1901) as a synopsis of <I>What Is To Be Done?</I> In February 1902 Lenin wrote the preface to the book, which appeared in the early days of March in Stuttgart where it was published by Dietz. An an nouncement of its publication was printed in the <I>Iskra</I>, No. 18, March 10, 1902. 
 
<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The ideas Lenin advanced and expounded in <I>What Is To Be Done?</I> were upheld and developed by Comrade Stalin. 

His pamphlet <A HREF="../Stalin/ADP05.html"><I>Briefly About the Disagreements in the Party</A></I>, written in the spring of 1905, is intimately connected with <I>What Is To Be Done?</I> (J. V. Stalin, <I>Works</I>, Russ. ed., Vol. 1, pp. 89-130). The defence of Lenin's ideas, enunciated in <I>What Is To Be Done?</I>, is taken up by Comrade Stalin also in his article "<A HREF="../Stalin/RSD05.html">A Reply to <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</A></I>," published in the newspaper <I>Proletariatis Brdazola</I> (<I>The Struggle of the Proletariat</I> ) in August 1905 (J. V. Stalin, <I>Works</I>, Russ. ed., Vol. 1, pp. 160-72). Lenin gave a high appraisal of this article, noting, in particular, that it contained a "splendid presentation of the question of the celebrated 'introduction of consciousness from without.'"

<FONT SIZE=-1>
   In republishing <I>What Is To Be Done?</I> in 1907 in the collection <I>Twelve Years</I>, Lenin omitted section A of Chapter V "Who Was Offended by the Article ' Where To Begin?'" and announced in the preface that the book was being published "with very slight abridgements, omitting only details concerning organizational relationships and minor polemical remarks." Lenin added five footnotes to the new edition.  

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The text of <I>What Is To Be Done?</I> given in Vol. 5 of V. I. Lenin's <I>Collected Works</I> (from which this translation has been made) follows the 1902 edition, checked with the text of the 1907 edition.

   <I>Iskra</I> (<I>The Spark </I>) -- the first all-Russian illegal Marxist newspaper, founded by Lenin in 1900. It played a decisive role in the formation of the Marxist party, in the defeat of the "Economists," in the unification of the dispersed Social-Democratic groups and in preparation for the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.  

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The publication of a revolutionary newspaper in Russia was impossible owing to police persecution. While still in exile in Siberia, Lenin worked out all the details of a plan to publish the paper abroad and proceeded to carry out this plan as soon as his term of exile ended in January 1900. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The first issue of Lenin's <I>Iskra</I> appeared on December 11 (24), 1900, in Leipzig, after which it was published in Munich, London (from April 1902) and, beginning with the spring of 1903, in Geneva. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The editorial board of the Iskra was made up of V. I. Lenin, G. V. Plekhanov, Y. O. Martov, P. B. Axelrod, A. N. Potresov and V. I. Zasulich. N. K. Krupskaya became secretary of the editorial board in the spring of 1900. Lenin was the <I>Iskra</I>'s actual editor-in-chief and leader of its activities. His articles in the <I>Iskra</I> dealt with all the fundamental problems of building the Party and of the class struggle of the proletariat in Russia as well as with outstanding events on the international scene. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Groups and committees of the R.S.D.L.P. supporting the Lenin-<I>Iskra</I> line were organized in many cities of Russia, including St. Petersburg and Moscow. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Iskra organizations were founded by and worked under the direct guidance of professional revolutionaries trained by Lenin (N. E. Bauman, I. V. Babushkin, S. I. Gusev, M. I. Kalinin and others). 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    On Lenin's initiative, and with his immediate participation, the <I>Iskra</I> editorial board drew up a draft program of the Party (published in issue No. 21), and prepared the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., which was held in July-August 1903. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    By that time most of the Social-Democratic organizations in Russia had associated themselves with the <I>Iskra</I>, approved its tactics, program and organizational plan, and recognized it as their leading organ. In a 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 239</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
special resolution the Second Congress recorded the exceptional role of the paper in the struggle to create the Party and adopted the <I>Iskra</I> as the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Second Congress appointed an editorial board consisting of Lenin, Plekhanov and Martov. Contrary to the Congress decision, Martov refused to serve on the board, and issues 46-51 of the <I>Iskra</I> were edited by Lenin and Plekhanov. Subsequently, Plekhanov took his stand with the Mensheviks and demanded that all the former Menshevik editors, who had been rejected by the Congress, be included in the editorial board. Lenin could not agree to this, and on October 19 (November 1), 1903, resigned from the editorial board in order to involve himself in the Central Committee of the Party and to strike at the Menshevik opportunists from this position. Issue 52 of the <I>Iskra</I> was edited by Plekhanov alone. On November 13 (26), 1903, acting on his own and in defiance of the will of the Congress, Plekhanov co-opted the former Menshevik editors to the editorial board. Beginning with the 52nd issue of the <I>Iskra</I>, the Mensheviks converted it into their organ. From that time Lenin's Bolshevik <I>Iskra</I>, known in the Party as the old <I>Iskra</I>, was replaced by the Menshevik opportunist <I>Iskra</I> as the <I>new Iskra</I>.

   <I>Lassalleans</I> and <I>Eisenachers</I> -- two parties in the German working class movement in the sixties and early seventies of the nineteenth century.  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Lassalleans</I> -- adherents and followers of Ferdinand Lassalle. The General German Labour League, founded by Lassalle in 1863, made up the core of the movement. Proceeding from the possibility of a peaceful transformation of capitalism into Socialism with the aid of workers' associations supported by the capitalist state, the Lassalleans advocated the 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 240</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
struggle for universal franchise and peaceful parliamentary activities as a substitute for the revolutionary struggle of the working class. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Marx trenchantly criticized the Lassalleans, pointing out that "over a course of several years they were a hindrance to the organization of the proletariat and ended up by becoming no more than a tool in the hands of the police." Marx gives an appraisal of the theoretical views of the Lassalleans and of their tactics in <A HREF="../M&amp;E/CGP75.html"><I>Critique of the  Gotha Program</A></I>, <I>Alleged Splits in the  International</I> and in correspondence with Engels. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <I>Eisenachers</I> -- supporters of Marxism, ideologically influenced by Marx and Engels. Led by Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel, they founded the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Germany at the Eisenach Congress in I869. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The two parties, which fought each other bitterly, were impelled to merge by the rise of the workers' movement and intensified reprisals by the government. The merger was effected at the Gotha Congress in 1875, when a single Socialist Labour Party of Germany was formed, in which the Lassalleans represented the opportunist wing. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Lenin describes the Lassalleans and Eisenachers in his article "August Bebel," written in August 1913.

   <I>Guesdites</I> and <I>Possibilists</I> -- two trends in the French Socialist movement; they originated in 1882 following the split in the French Labour Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <I>Guesdites</I> -- supporters of Jules Guesde. They represented the Left, Marxist trend and maintained that the proletariat must pursue an independent revolutionary policy. In 1901 the Guesdites founded the Socialist Party of France. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   <I>Possibilists</I> -- a petty-bourgeois, reformist trend which sought to deflect the proletariat from revolutionary methods of struggle. They proposed to confine the activities of the working class to what was "possible" under capitalism. In 1902, in conjunction with other reformist groups, they founded the French Socialist Party. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
    The Socialist Party of France and the French Socialist Party merged in 1905. During the imperialist war of 1914-18 Jules Guesde, in common with the leadership of the French Socialist Party, took his stand as a social-chauvinist.

   <I>Fabians</I> -- members of the reformist and opportunist Fabian Society, formed by a group of British bourgeois intellectuals in 1884. The society took its name from the Roman General Fabius Cunctator (the "Delayer"), famous for his procrastinating tactics and avoidance of decisive battles. The Fabian Society represented, as Lenin put it, "the most finished expression of opportunism and liberal-labour politics." The Fabians sought 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 241</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
to deflect the proletariat from the class struggle and advocated the possibility of a peaceful, gradual transition from capitalism to socialism by means of reforms. During the imperialist world war (1914-18) the Fabians took a social-chauvinist stand. For a characterization of the Fabians see Lenin's "Preface to the Russian Edition of <I>Letters by J. P.

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The Narodnaya Volya was smashed by the tsarist government soon after its members had assassinated Alexander II on March 1 (13), 1881. Following this the majority of the Narodniks abandoned the revolutionary struggle against tsardom, began to advocate reconciliation and agreement with the tsarist autocracy. These Epigoni of Narodism, the liberal Narodniks of the eighties and nineties of the nineteenth century actually voiced the interests of the kulaks.

Feigning democracy and calling themselves the party of "people's freedom," the Cadets tried to win the peasantry to their side. They strove to preserve tsarism in the form of a constitutional monarchy. Subsequently, the Cadets became the party of the imperialist bourgeoisie. After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the Cadets organized counter-revolutionary conspiracies and revolts against the Soviet Republic.

   <I>Bezzaglavtsi</I> -- the group that founded and edited the magazine <I>Bez Zaglaviya</I> (<I>Without a Title</I>) published in St. Petersburg in 1906. The group, which included S. N. Prokopovich, E. D. Kuskova, V. Y. Bogucharsky and others, openly advocated revisionism, supported the Mensheviks and liberals and was opposed to the proletariat pursuing an independent policy. Lenin called the Bezzaglavtsi pro-Menshevik Cadets or pro-Cadet Mensheviks.

   <I>The Katheder-Socialists</I> (<I>Socialists of the Chair</I>) -- a trend in bourgeois political economy, originated in Germany in the seventies and eighties of the nineteenth century. The Katheder-Socialists used their position as university lecturers to preach bourgeois-liberal reformism under the guise of Socialism. Their contention was that the bourgeois state stood above classes, was capable of reconciling hostile classes, gradually introducing "Socialism" without encroaching on the interests of the capitalists and, as far as possible, of taking into account the demands of the workers. The views of the Katheder-Socialists were advocated in Russia by the "legal Marxists."

The discussion of this question at the congress and the adoption of a special resolution were necessitated by the opportunists, led by Bernstein, advocating the revision of Marxist theory and demanding a review of Social-Democratic revolutionary policy and tactics. The Hanover resolution rejected the demands of the revisionists but failed to criticize or expose Bernsteinism. Bernstein's supporters voted for the resolution.

It heard a statement <I>in absentia</I> from Bernstein, in which he set forth and defended his opportunist views, expounded earlier in a number of articles. Bernstein's opponents at the congress failed to take a united stand. One section (Bebel and others) advocated ideological struggle against Bernstein and criticism of his mistakes, but did not agree to take organizational measures against him. Another section, the minority headed by Rosa Luxemburg, was more resolute in its opposition to Bernsteinism.

through his sister, A. I. Yelizarova, Lenin wrote a sharp protest in which he exposed the nature of this declaration. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Protest was discussed and unanimously endorsed by a meeting of seventeen exiled Marxists, convened by Lenin in the village of Yermakovskoye, Minusinsk District. The exiles in the Turukhansk District and in Orlovo (Vyatka Gubernia) subsequently associated themselves with it. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Lenin forwarded a copy of the Protest to the Emancipation of Labour group abroad, where it was published in early 1900 by G. V. Plekhanov in his <I>Vademecum for the Editors of the Rabocheye Dyelo</I>.

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The group did much to spread Marxism in Russia. It translated such Marxist works as <I>Manifesto of the Communist Party</I> by Marx and Engels, <I>Wage-Labour and Capital</I> by Marx, and <I>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</I> by Engels, publishing them abroad and illegally spreading them in Russia. Plekhanov and his group dealt a serious blow at Narodism. The group, however, made some serious mistakes, which were the first projections of the future Menshevik views held by Plekhanov and other members of the group.

Lenin in the autumn of 1895 and united all the Marxist workers' circles in St. Petersburg. It was headed by a Central Group that was directed by Lenin. The League of Struggle was the first organization in Russia to combine Socialism with the working-class movement and to pass over from the propaganda of Marxism among a small circle of advanced workers to political agitation among the broad masses of the working class.

   <I>Bund</I> -- the General Jewish Workers' Union of Lithuania, Poland and 
Russia. Founded in 1897, it embraced mainly the Jewish artisans in the western regions of Russia. The Bund joined the R.S.D.L.P. at the latter's First Congress in March 1898. At the Second R.S.D.L.P. Congress the Bund delegates insisted on their organization being recognized as the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat in Russia. The Congress rejected this organizational nationalism, whereupon the Bund withdrew from the Party.  

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   In 1906, following the Fourth ("Unity") Congress, the Bund reaffiliated to the R.S.D.L.P. The Bundists constantly supported the Mensheviks and waged an incessant struggle against the Bolsheviks. Despite its formal affiliation to the R.S.D.L.P., the Bund was an organization of a bourgeois-nationalist character. As opposed to the Bolshevik programmatic demand for the right of nations to self-determination, the Bund put for ward the demand for cultural-national autonomy. During the First World War of l914-18 the Bundists took the stand of social-chauvinism. In 1917 the Bund supported the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government and fought on the side of the enemies of the October Socialist Revolution.

During the Civil War prominent Bundists joined forces with the counter-revolution. At the same time a turn began among the rank-and-file members of the Bund in favour of collaboration with the Soviet government. Only when the victory of the proletarian dictatorship over the internal counter-revolution and foreign interventionists became evident did the Bund declare its abandonment of the struggle against the Soviet system. In March 1921, the Bund went into voluntary liquidation and part of its membership joined the R.C.P.(B.) in the ordinary way.

   <I>Iskra</I>, No. 7 (August 1901), carried in its section "The Workers' Movement and Letters from the Mills and Factories," a letter from a weaver which testified to the vast influence Lenin's <I>Iskra</I> exercised on the advanced workers. The letter reads in part:    ". . . I showed the <I>Iskra</I> to many fellow workers and the copy has been read to tatters; but we treasure it greatly. . . . The <I>Iskra</I> writes about our own cause, about the cause of all Russia which cannot be evaluated in kopeks or measured in hours of work; when you read the paper you understand why the gendarmes and police are afraid of us workers and of those intellectuals whom we follow. There is no denying that they do not simply make the bosses tremble for their pocketbooks, but inspire fear in the tsar, the employers and the rest. . . . It will not take much now to set the working folk aflame. All that is wanted is a spark to kindle the fire that is already smouldering among the people. How true are the words 'the spark will kindle a flame!'. . . . In the past every strike was an event, but today everyone sees that strikes alone are not enough, that we must now strive for liberty, win it by might and main. Today everyone, old and young, is eager to read, but the sad thing is that there are no books. Last Sunday I gathered eleven people and read them

'Where To Begin?', and we discussed it till late in the evening. How true it expresses everything, how it gets to the very heart of things. . . . And we would like to write a letter to your <I>Iskra</I>, to ask you to teach us not only how to begin, but how to live and how to die."

   <I>L.

Using Marxist phraseology as a cover, Brentano and his followers endeavoured to subordinate the working-class movement to the interests of the bourgeoisie.
