                                                     BLANCISM<P><BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Louis Blanc, the French socialist, won unenviable notoriety during the revolution of 1848 by changing his stand from that of the class struggle to that of petty-bourgeois illusions, illusions adorned with would-be "socialist" phraseology, but in reality tending to strengthen the influence of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat. Louis Blanc looked to the bourgeoisie for assistance, hoped, and inspired hopes in others, that the bourgeoisie <I>could</I> help the workers in the matter of "labour organisation" -- this vague term purporting to express "socialist" tendencies. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Blancism has now gained the upper hand in Right-wing "Social-Democracy", in the Organising Committee party in Russia. Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Steklov, and many others,<A NAME="p34"> who are now leaders of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies and were also leaders of the recent All-Russia Conference of Soviets,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LB17.html#en15">15</A>]</FONT> have taken the same stand as Louis Blanc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   On all major issues of present-day political life these leaders, who occupy approximately the position of the international Centrist trend represented by Kautsky, Longuet, Turati, and many others, have embraced the petty-bourgeois views of Louis Blanc. Take, for instance, the question of war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The proletarian standpoint in this matter consists of a definite <I>class</I> characterisation of war, and of an irreconcilable hostility to imperialist war -- that is, to a war <I>between</I> groups of capitalist countries (<I>no matter</I> whether monarchies or <I>republics </I>) <I>for</I> a division of capitalist spoils. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The petty-bourgeois viewpoint differs from the bourgeois one (outright justification of the war, outright "defence of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 35</B></FONT><P>

the fatherland", i.e., defence of the <I>interests</I> of <I>one's own</I> capitalists, defence of <I>their</I> "right" to annexations) in that the petty bourgeois "renounces" annexations, "condemns" imperialism, "demands" from the bourgeoisie that it cease to be imperialistic while keeping within the framework of world-imperialist relations and the capitalist system of economy. Confining himself to this mild, innocuous, wishy-washy declamation, the petty bourgeois, <I>in practice</I>, trails helplessly <I>behind</I> the bourgeoisie, "sympathising" in some things with the proletariat in words, remaining dependent on the bourgeoisie in deeds, unable or unwilling to understand the path leading to the overthrow of the capitalist yoke, the only path that can rid the world of imperialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To "demand" of the bourgeois governments that they make a "<I>solemn declaration </I>" in the spirit of renouncing annexations is the height of audacity on the part of the petty bourgeois, and an example of anti-imperialist "Zimmerwaldist" consistency. It is not difficult to see that this is Blancism of the worst type. For one thing, no bourgeois politician with any experience will ever have difficulty in mouthing any number of glib, "brilliant", high-sounding phrases against annexations "in general", as meaningless as they are non-committal. But when<A NAME="p35"> it comes to <I>deeds</I>, one can always do a conjuring trick after the manner of <I>Rech</I>, which had the deplorable courage to declare that Kurland<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LB17.html#en16">16</A>]</FONT> (now annexed by the imperialist predators of bourgeois Germany) was <I>not</I> annexed by Russia! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is trickery of the most disgusting kind, the most shameless deception of the workers by the bourgeoisie, for anybody the least familiar with politics must know that Kurland <I>had always been annexed</I> to Russia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We openly and directly challenge <I>Rech </I>: (1) to present to the people such a political definition of the concept "annexation" as would apply equally to <I>all</I> annexations in the world, German, British, and Russian, past and present, to all without exception; (2) to state clearly and definitely what, in its opinion, is meant by <I>renunciation of annexations</I>, not in word, but in deed. To give such a political definition of the concept "renunciation of annexations in deed" as would apply not only to the Germans, but also to the English and all other nations who have ever practised annexations. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 36</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  We maintain that <I>Rech</I> will either decline to accept our challenge or it will be exposed by us before the whole nation. And it is precisely because of this question of Kurland touched upon by <I>Rech</I> that our dispute is not a theoretical one but a practical one of the greatest urgency and vital interest. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Second, let us assume, if only for a moment, that the bourgeois ministers are the ideal of honesty, that the Guchkovs, Lvovs, Milyukovs and Co. sincerely <I>believe</I> in the possibility of renouncing annexations, while preserving capitalism, and that they really <I>want</I> to renounce them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us, for a moment, assume even this, let us make this Blancist assumption. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One is entitled to ask: Can a grown-up person be content with what people <I>think</I> of themselves, without comparing it with what they <I>do </I>? Is it possible for a Marxist <I>not</I> to distinguish good wishes and declarations from objective realities? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No. It is not. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Annexations are maintained by the bonds of finance capital, banking capital, imperialist capital. <I>Herein</I> is the modern, the economic foundation of annexations. From this angle, annexations are politically guaranteed <I>profits</I> on thousands of millions of capital "invested" in thousands upon thousands of enterprises in the annexed countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is <I>impossible</I>, even given the wish to do so, to renounce annexations <I>without taking</I> decisive steps towards throwing off the yoke of capitalism. 
<A NAME="p36">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Does that mean, as <I>Yedinstvo</I>, <I>Rabochaya Gazeta</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LB17.html#en17">17</A>]</FONT> and the other "Louis Blancs" of our petty bourgeoisie are ready to conclude and actually do conclude, that we must <I>not</I> take any decisive steps towards overthrowing capitalism, that we must accept at least a modicum of annexations? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No. Decisive steps <I>must</I> be taken towards the overthrow of capitalism. They must be taken ably and gradually, relying <I>only</I> on the class-consciousness and organised activity of the overwhelming majority of the workers and poor peasants. But taken they must be. The Soviets of Workers' Deputies have <I>already</I> started to take them in a number of places in Russia. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 37</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The order of the day now is a decisive and irrevocable parting of the ways with the Louis Blancs -- the Chkheidzes, Tseretelis, Steklovs, the party of the O.C., the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc., etc. The masses must be made to see that Blancism is ruining and will utterly ruin the further success of the revolution, even the success of freedom, unless the masses realise how harmful these petty-bourgeois illusions are and join the class-conscious workers in their cautious, gradual, well-considered, yet firm and direct steps towards socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Outside of socialism there is <I>no</I> deliverance of humanity from wars, from hunger, from the destruction of still more millions and millions of human beings.

   <I>The All-Russia Conference of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies</I> convened by the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet was held in Petrograd between March 29 and April 3 (April 11 and 16), 1917.

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The Conference was attended by representatives of the Petrograd and local Soviets, as well as of front and rear army units. The Conference discussed the questions of the war, the attitude towards the Provisional Government, the Constituent Assembly, the agrarian, food and other questions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   The Conference, at which the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had a controlling influence, took a stand of "revolutionary defencism" and adopted a resolution calling for support to the bourgeois Provisional Government.
