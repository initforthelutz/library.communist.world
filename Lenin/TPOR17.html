<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The moment of history through which Russia is now passing is marked by the following main characteristics: 
<P><BR>
<CENTER>
                           THE CLASS CHARACTER OF THE REVOLUTlON <BR>
                                           THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  1.&nbsp;The old tsarist power, which representod only a handful of feudalist landowners who commanded the entire state machinery (the army, the police, and the bureaucracy), has been overthrown and removed, but not completely destroyed. The monarchy has not been formally abolished; the Romanov gang continues to hatch monarchist intrigues. The vast landed possessions of the feudalist squirearchy have not been abolished. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   2.&nbsp;State power in Russia has passed into the hands of a new <I>class</I>, namely, the bourgeoisie and landowners who had become bourgeois. <I>To this extent</I> the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia is completed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Having come to power, the bourgeoisie has formed a bloc (an alliance) with the overt monarchists, who are notorious for their exceptionally ardent support of Nicholas<A NAME="p57"> the Bloody and Stolypin the Hangman in 1906-14 (Guchkov and other politicians to the right of the Cadets<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en26">26</A>]</FONT>). The new bourgeois government of Lvov and Co. has attempted and has begun to negotiate with the Romanovs for the restoration of the monarchy in Russia. Behind a screen of revolutionary phrases, this government is appointing partisans of the old regime to key positions. It is striving to reform the whole machinery of state (the army, the police, and the bureaucracy) as little as possible, and has turned it over to the bourgeoisie. The new government has already begun to hinder 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 58</B></FONT><P>

in every way the revolutionary initiative of mass action and the seizure of power by the people <I>from below</I>, which is the <I>sole</I> guarantee of the real success of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Up to now this government has not even fixed a date for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly. It is not laying a finger on the landed estates, which form the material foundation of feudal tsarism. This government does not even contemplate starting an investigation into, and making public, the activities of the monopolist financial organisations, the big banks, the syndicatcs and cartels of the capitalists, etc., or instituting control over them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The key positions, the decisive ministerial posts in the new government (the Ministry of the Interior and the War Ministry, i.e., the command over the army, the police, the bureaucracy -- the entire apparatus for oppressing the people) are held by outright monarchists and supporters of the system of big landed estates. The Cadets, those day-old republicans, republicans against their own will, have been assigned minor posts,<A NAME="p58"> having no direct relation to the <I>command</I> over the people or to the apparatus of state power. A. Kerensky, a Trudovik<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en27">27</A>]</FONT> and "would-be socialist", has no function whatsoever, except to lull the vigilance and attention of the people with sonorous phrases. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For all these reasons, the new bourgeois government does not deserve the confidence of the proletariat even in the sphere of internal policy, and no support of this government by the proletariat is admissible. 
<P><BR>
<A NAME="s2">
<CENTER>
                          THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  3.&nbsp;In the field of foreign policy, which has now been brought to the forefront by objective circumstances, the new government is a government for the continuation of the imperialist war, a war that is being waged in alliance with the imperialist powers -- Britain, France, and others -- for division of the capitalist spoils and for subjugating small and weak nations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Subordinated to the interests of Russian capitalism and its powerful protector and master -- Anglo-French imperialist capitalism, the wealthiest in the world, the new govern-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 59</B></FONT><P>

ment, notwithstanding the wishes expressed in no uncertain fashion on behalf of the obvious majority of the peoples of Russia through the Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies, has taken no real steps to put an end to the slaughter of peoples for the interests of the capitalists. It has not even published the secret treaties of an obviously predatory character (for the partition of Persia, the plunder of China, the plunder of Turkey, the partition of Austria, the annexation of Eastern Prussia, the annexation of the German colonies, etc.), which, as everybody knows, bind Russia to Anglo-French predatory imperialist capital. It has <I>confirmed</I> these treaties concluded by tsarism, which for centuries robbed and oppressed more nations than other tyrants and despots, and which not only oppressed, but also disgraced and demoralised the Great-Russian nation by making it an executioner of other nations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The new government has confirmed these shameful depredatory treaties and has not proposed an immediate armistice to all the belligerent nations, in spite of the clearly expressed demand of the majority of the peoples of Russia, voiced through the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies. It has evaded the issue with the help of solemn, sonorous, bombastic, but ahsolutely empty declarations and phrases, which, in the mouths of bourgeois diplomats, have always served, and still serve, to deceive the trustful and na&iumlve masses of the oppressed people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   4.&nbsp;Not only, therefore, is the new government unworthy of the slightest confidence in the field of foreign policy, but to go on demanding that it should proclaim the will of the peoples of Russia for peace, that it should renounce annexations, and so on and so forth, is in practice merely to deceive the people, to inspire them with false hopes and to retard the clarification of their minds. It is indirectly to reconcile them to the continuation of a war the true social character of which is determined not by pious wishes, but by the class character of the government that wages the war, by the connection between the class represented by this government and the imperialist finance capital of Russia, Britain, France, etc., by <I>the real and actual policy</I> which that class is pursuing.

                              THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE DUAL POWER <BR>
                                     AND ITS CLASS SIGNIFICANCE
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  5.&nbsp;The main feature of our revolution, a feature that most imperatively demands thoughtful consideration, is the <I>dual power</I> which arose in the very first days after the triumph of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This dual power is evident in the existence of <I>two</I> governments: one is the main, the real, the actual government of the bourgeoisie, the "Provisional Government" of Lvov and Co., which holds in its hands all the organs of power; the other is a supplementary and parallel government, a "controlling" government in the shape of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which holds no organs of state power, but directly rests on the support of an obvious and indisputable majority of the people, on the armed workers and soldiers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The class origin and the class significance of this dual power is the following: the Russian revolution of March 1917 not only swept away the whole tsarist monarchy, not only transferred the entire power to the bourgeoisie, but also <I>moved close towards</I> a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. The Petrograd and the other, the local, Soviets constitute precisely such a dictatorship (that is, a power resting not on the law but directly on the force of armed masses of the population), a dictatorship precisely of the above-mentioned classes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   6.&nbsp;The second highly important feature of the Russian revolution is the fact that the Petrograd Soviet of Soldiers' and Workers' Deputies, which, as everything goes to show, enjoys the confidence of most of the local Soviets, is <I>voluntarily</I> transferring state power to the bourgeoisie and <I>its</I> Provisional Government, is voluntarily <I>ceding</I> supremacy to the latter, having entered into an agreement to support it, and is limiting its own role to that of an observer, a supervisor of the convocation of the Constituent Assembly (the date for which has not even been announced as yet by the Provisional Government). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This remarkable feature, unparalleled in history in such a form, has led to the <I>interlocking of two</I> dictatorships: the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 61</B></FONT><P>

dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (for the government of Lvov and Co. is a dictatorship, i.e., a power based not on the law, not on the previously expressed will of the people, but on seizure by force, accomplished by a definite class, namely, the bourgeoisie) and the dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry (the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is not the slightest doubt that such an "interlocking" cannot last long. Two powers <I>cannot exist</I> in a state. One of them is bound to pass away; and the entire Russian bourgeoisie is already trying its hardest everywhere and in every way to keep out and weaken the Soviets, to reduce them to nought, and to establish the undivided power of the bourgeoisie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The dual power merely expresses a <I>transitional</I> phase in the revolution's development, when it has gone farther than the ordinary bourgeois-democratic revolution, <I>but has not yet reached</I> a "pure" dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The class significance (and the class explanation) of this transitional and unstable situation is this: like all revolutions, our revolution required the greatest heroism and self-sacrifice on the part of the people for the struggle against tsarism; it also immediately <I>drew</I> unprecedentedly vast numbers of ordinary citizens <I>into the movement.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From the point of view of science and practical politics, one of the chief symptoms of <I>every</I> real revolution is the unusually rapid, sudden, and abrupt increase in the number of "ordinary citizens" who begin to participate actively, independently and effectively in political life and in the <I>organisation of the state.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such is the case in Russia. Russia at present is seething. Millions and tens of millions of people, who had been politically dormant for ten years and politically crushed by the terrible oppression of tsarism and by inhuman toil for the landowners and capitalists, <I>have awakened and taken eagerly</I> to politics. And who are these millions and tens of millions? For the most part small proprietors, petty bourgeois, people standing midway between the capitalists and the wage-workers Russia is the most petty-bourgeois of all European countries. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 62</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  A gigantic petty-bourgeois wave has swept over everything and overwhelmed the class-conscious proletariat, not only by force of numbers but also ideologically; that is, it has infected and imbued very wide circles of workers with the petty-bourgeois political outlook. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The petty bourgeoisie are in real llfe dependent upon the bourgeoisie, for they live like masters and not like proletarians (from the point of view of their <I>place</I> in social <I>production </I>) and follow the bourgeoisie in their outlook. 
<A NAME="p62">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   An attitude of unreasoning trust in the capitalists -- the worst foes of peace and socialism -- characterises the politics of the <I>popular masses</I> in Russla at the present moment; this is the fruit that has <I>grown</I> with revolutionary rapidity on the social and economic soil of the most petty-bourgeois of all European countries. This is the <I>class</I> basis for the "<I>agreement </I>" between the Provisional Government and the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies (I emphasise that I am referrmg not so much to the formal agreement as to <I>actual support</I>, a tacit agreement, the surrender of power inspired by unreasoning trust), an agreement which has given the Guchkovs a fat piece -- real power -- and the Soviet merely promises and honours (for the time being), flattery, phrases, assurances, and the bowings and scrapings of the Kerenskys. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   On the other side we have the inadequate numerical strength of the proletariat in Russia and its insufficient class-consciousness and organisation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All the Narodnik parties, including the Socialist-Revolutionaries, have always been petty-bourgeois. This is also true of the party of the Organising Committee (Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.). The non-party revolutionaries (Steklov and others) have similarly yielded to the tide, or have not been able to stand up to it, have not had the time to do it.

                           THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE TACTICS <BR>
                                  WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABOVE
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  7.&nbsp;For the Marxist, who must reckon with objective facts, with the masses and classes, and not with individuals and so on, the peculiar nature of the actual situation as 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 63</B></FONT><P>

described above must determine the peculiar nature of the tactics for the <I>present</I> moment. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This peculiarity of the situation calls, in the first place, for the pouring of vinegar and bile into the sweet water of revolutionary-democratic phrassology" (as my fellow member on the Central Committee of our Party, Teodorovich, so aptly put it at yesterday's session of the All-Russia Congress of Railwaymen in Petrograd). Our work must be one of criticism, of <I>explaining</I> the mistakes of the petty-bourgeois Socialist-Revolutionary and Social-Democratic parties, of preparing and welding the elements of a <I>consciously</I> proletarian, Communist Party, and of <I>curing</I> the proletariat of the "general" petty-bourgeois intoxication. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This <I>seems</I> to be "nothing more" than propaganda work, but in reality it is most <I>practical revolutionary</I> work; for there is no advancing a revolution that has come to a standstill, that has choked itself with phrases, and that keeps 'marking time",<A NAME="p63"> <I>not because</I> of external obstacles, <I>not because of the violence</I> of the bourgeoisie (Guchkov is still only threatening to employ violence against the soldier mass), but <I>because</I> of the unreasoning trust of the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Only by overcoming this unreasoning trust (and we can and should overcome it only ideologically, by comradely persuasion, by pointing to the <I>lessons of experience </I>) can we set ourselves free from the prevailing <I>orgy of revolutionary phrase-mongering</I> and really stimulate the consciousness both of the proletariat and of the mass in general, as well as their bold and determined initiative <I>in the localities</I> -- the independent realisation, development and consolidation of liberties, democracy, and the principle of people's ownership of all the land. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   8.&nbsp;The world-wide experience of bourgeois and landowner governments has evolved <I>two</I> methods of keeping the people in subjection. The first is violence. Nicholas Romanov I, nicknamed Nicholas of the Big Stick, and Nicholas II, the Bloody, demonstrated to the Russian people the maximum of what can and cannot he done in the way of these hangmen's practices. But there is another method, best developed by the British and French bourgeoisie, who "learned their lesson" in a series of great revolulions and revolutionary movements of the massee. It is the method of deception, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 64</B></FONT><P>

flattery, fine phrases, promises by the million, petty sops, and concessions of the unessential while retaining the essential. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The peculiar feature of the present situation in Russia is the transition at a dizzy speed from the first method to the second,<A NAME="p64"> from violent oppression of the people to <I>flattering</I> and deceiving the people by promises. Vaska the Cat listens, but goes on eating.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en28">28</A>]</FONT> Milyukov and Guchkov are holding power, they are protecting the profits of the capitalists, conducting an imperialist war in the interests of Russian and Anglo-French capital, and trying to get away with promises, declamation and bombastic statements in reply to the speeches of "cooks" like Chkheidze, Tsereteli and Steklov, who threaten, exhort, conjure, beseech, demand and proclaim. . . . Vaska the Cat listens, but goes on eating. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But from day to day trustful lack of reasoning and unreasoning trust will be falling away, especially among the proletarians and <I>poor</I> peasants, who are being taught by experience (by their social and economic position) to distrust the capitalists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The leaders of the petty bourgeoisie "must" teach the people to trust the bourgeoisie. The proletarians must teach the people to distrust the bourgeoisie.

                                      REVOLUTIONARY DEFENCISM <BR>
                                    AND ITS CLASS SIGNIFICANCE
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
 9.&nbsp;<I>Revolutionary defencism</I> must be regarded as the most mportant, the most striking manifestation of the petty-bourgeois wave that has swept over "nearly everything". It is the worst enemy of the further progress and success of the Russian revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Those who have yielded on this point and have been unable to extricate themselves are lost to the revolution. But the masses yield in a different way from the leaders, and they extricate themselves <I>differently</I>, by a different course of development, by different means. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Revolutionary defencism is, on the one hand, a result of the deception of the masses by the bourgeoisie, a result of the trustful lack of reasoning on the part of the peasants 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 65</B></FONT><P>

and a section of the workers; it is, on the other, an expression of the interests and point of view of the small proprietor, who is to some extent interested in annexations and bank profits, and who "sacredly" guards the traditions of tsarism, which demoralised the Great Russians by making them do a hangman's work against the other peoples. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The bourgeoisie deceives the people by working on their noble pride in the revolution and by pretending that the <I>social and political</I> character of the war, as far as Russia is concerned, underwent a change because of this stage of the revolution, because of the substitution of the near republic of Guchkov and Milyukov for the tsarist monarchy. And the people believed it -- for a time -- largely owing to age-old prejudices, which made them look upon the other peoples of Russia, i.e., the non-Great Russians, as something in the nature of a property and private estate of the Great Russians. This vile demoralisation of the Great Russian people by tsarism which taught them to regard the other peoples as something inferior, something belonging "by right" to Great Russia, could not disappear <I>instantly.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What is required of us is the <I>ability</I> to explain to the masses that the social and political character of the war is determined not by the "good will" of individuals or groups, or even of nations, but by the position of the <I>class</I> which conducts the war, by the class <I>policy</I> of which the war is a continuation, by the <I>ties</I> of capital, which is the dominant economic force in modern society, by the <I>imperialist character</I> of international capital, by Russia's dependence in finance, banking and diplomacy upon Britain, France, and so on. To explain this skilfully in a way the people would understand <I>is not easy </I>; none of us would be able to do it at once without committing errors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But this, and only this, must be the aim or, rather, the message of our propaganda. The slightest concession to revolutionary defencism is <I>a betrayal of socialism</I>, a complete renunciation of <I>internationalism</I>, no matter by what fine phrases and "practical" considerations it may be justified. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The slogan "Down with the War!" is, of course, correct. But it fails to take into account the specific nature of the tasks of the present moment and the necessity of <I>approach-</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 66</B></FONT><P>

<I>ing</I> the broad mass of the people <I>in a different way</I>. It reminds me of the slogan "Down with the Tsar!" with which the inexperienced agitator of the "good old days" went simply and directly to the countryside -- and got a beating for his pains. The mass believers in revolutionary defencism are <I>honest</I>, not in the personal, but in the class sense, i.e., they belong to <I>classes</I> (workers and the peasant poor) which <I>in actual fact</I> have nothing to gain from annexations and the subjugation of other peoples. This is nothing like the bourgeois and the "intellectual" fraternity, who know very well that you <I>cannot</I> renounce annexations without renouncing the rule of capital, and who unscrupulously deceive the people with fine phrases, with unlimited promises and endless assurances. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The rank-and-file believer in defencism regards the matter in the simple way of the man in the street: "I don't want annexations, but the Germans are 'going for' <I>me</I>, therefore I'm defending a just cause and not any kind of imperialist interests at all." To a man like this it must be explained again and again that it is not a question of his personal wishes, but of mass, <I>class</I>, political relations and conditions, of the connection between the war and the interests of capital and the international network of banks, and so forth. Only such a struggle against defencism will be serious and will promise success -- perhaps not a very rapid success, but one that will be real and enduring.

                                       HOW CAN THE WAR BE ENDED?
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  10.&nbsp;The war cannot be ended "at will". It cannot be ended by the decision of one of the belligerents. It cannot be ended by "sticking your bayonet into the ground", as one soldier, a defencist, expressed it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The war cannot be ended by an "agreement" among the socialists of the various countries, by the "action" of the proletarians of all countries, by the "will" of the peoples, and so forth. All the phrases of this kind, which fill the articles of the defencist, semi-defencist, and semi-internationalist papers as well as innumerable resolutions, appeals, manifestos, and the resolutions of the Soviet of Soldiers.' 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 67</B></FONT><P>

and Workers' Deputies -- all such phrases are nothing but idle, innocent and pious wishes of the petty bourgeois. There is nothing more harmful than phrases like "ascertaining the will of the peoples for peace", like the <I>sequence</I> of revolutionary actions of the proletariat (after the Russian proletariat comes the turn of the German), etc. All this is Blancism, fond dreams, a playing at "political campaigning", and in reality just a repetition of the fable of Vaska the Cat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The war is not a product of the evil will of rapacious capitalists, although it is undoubtedly being fought <I>only</I> in their interests and they alone are being enriched by it. The war is a product of half a century of development of world capitalism and of its billions of threads and connections. It is <I>impossible</I> to slip out of the imperialist war and achieve a democratic, non-coercive peace without overthrowing the power of capital and transferring state power to <I>another</I> class, the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Russian revolution of February-March 1917 was the beginning of the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war. This revolution took the <I>first</I> step towards ending the war; but it requires a <I>second</I> step, namely, the transfer of state power to the proletariat, to make the end of the war a <I>certainty</I>. This will be the beginning of a "break-through" on a world-wide scale, a break-through in the front of capitalist interests; and only by breaking through <I>this</I> front <I>can</I> the proletariat save mankind from the horrors of war and endow it with the blessings of peace. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is directly to such a "break-through" in the front of capitalism that the Russian revolution has <I>already</I> brought the Russian proletariat by creating the Soviets of Workers' Deputies.

                                            A NEW TYPE OF STATE <BR>
                                   EMERGING FROM OUR REVOLUTION
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  11.&nbsp;The Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', Peasants' and other Deputies are not understood, not only in the sense that their class significance, their role in the <I>Russian</I> revolution, is not clear to the majority. They are not understood also in the sense that they constitute a new form or rather a new <I>type of state.</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 68</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The most perfect, the most advanced type of bourgeois state is the <I>parliamentary democratic republic </I>: power is vested in parliament; the state machine, the apparatus and organ of administration, is of the customary kind: the standing army, the police, and the bureaucracy -- which in practice is undisplaceable, is privileged and stands <I>above</I> the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Since the end of the nineteenth century, however, revolutionary epochs have advanced a <I>higher</I> type of democratic state, a state which in certain respects, as Engels put it,<A NAME="p68"> ceases to be a state, is "no longer a state in the proper sense of the word".<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en29">29</A>]</FONT> This is a state of the Paris Commune type, one in which a standing army and police divorced from the people are <I>replaced</I> by the direct arming of the people themselves. It is <I>this feature</I> that constitutes the very essence of the Commune, which has been so misrepresented and slandered by the bourgeois writers, and to which has been erroneously ascribed, among other things, the intention of immediately "introducing" socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is the type of state which the Russian revolution <I>began</I> to create in 1905 and in 1917. A Republic of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', Peasants', and other Deputies, united in an All-Russia Constituent Assembly of people's representatives or in a Council of Soviets, etc., is what is <I>already being realised</I> in our country now, at this juncture. It is being realised by the initiative of the nation's millions, who are creating a democracy on their own, <I>in their own way</I> without waiting until the Cadet professors draft their legislative bills for a parliamentary bourgeois republic, or until the pedants and routine-worshippers of petty-bourgeois "Social-Democracy", like Mr. Plekhanov or Kautsky, stop distorting the Marxist teaching on the state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marxism differs from anarchism in that it recognises the <I>need</I> for a state and for state power in the period of revolution in general, and in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism in particular. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marxism differs from the petty-bourgeois, opportunist "Social-Democratism" of Plekhanov, Kautsky and Co. in that it recognises that what is required during these two periods is <I>not</I> a state of the usual parliamentary bourgeois republican type, but a state of the Paris Commune type. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 69</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The main distinctions between a state of the latter type and the old state are as follows. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is quite easy (as history proves) to revert from a parliamentary bourgeois republic to a monarchy, for all the machinery of oppression -- the army, the police, and the bureaucracy -- is left intact. The Commune and the Soviet <I>smash</I> that machinery and do away with it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The parliamentary bourgeois republic hampers and stifles the independent political life of the <I>masses</I> their direct participation in the <I>democratic</I> organisation of the life of the state from the bottom up. The opposite is the case with the Soviets. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The latter reproduce the type of state which was being evolved by the Paris Commune and which<A NAME="p69"> Marx described as "the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economic emancipation of labour".<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en30">30</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are usually told that the Russian people are not yet prepared for the "introduction" of the Commune. This was the argument of the serf-owners when they claimed that the peasants were not prepared for emancipation. The Commune, i.e., the Soviets, does not "introduce", does not intend to "introduce", and must not introduce <I>any</I> reforms which have not absolutely matured both in economic reality and in the minds of the overwhelming majority of the people. The deeper the economic collapse and the crisis produced by the war, the more urgent becomes the need for the most perfect political form, which will <I>facilitate</I> the healing of the terrible wounds inflicted on mankind by the war. The less the organisational experience of the Russian people, the more resolutely must we <I>proceed</I> to organisational development by the <I>people themselves</I> and not merely by the bourgeois politicians and "well-placed" bureaucrats. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The sooner we shed the old prejudices of pseudo-Marxism, a Marxism falsified by Plekhanov, Kautsky and Co., the more actively we set about helping the people to organise Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies everywhere and immediately, and helping the latter to take life <I>in its entirety</I> under their control, and the longer Lvov and Co. delay the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, the easier will it  be for the people (through the medium of the Constituent

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 70</B></FONT><P>

Assembly, or independently of it, if Lvov delays its convocation too long) to cast their decision in favour of a republic of Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies. Errors in the new work of organisational development by the people themselves are at first inevitable; but it is better to make mistakes and go forward than to <I>wait</I> until the professors of law summoned by Mr. Lvov draft their laws for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, for the perpetuation of the parliamentary bourgeois republic and for the strangling of the Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If we organise ourselves and conduct our propaganda skilfully, not only the proletarians, but nine-tenths of the peasants will be opposed to the restoration of the police, will be opposed to an undisplaceable and privileged bureaucracy and to an army divorced from the people. And that is all the new type of state stands for. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   12.&nbsp;The substitution of a people's militia for the police is a reform that follows from the entire course of the revolution and that is now being introduced in most parts of Russia. We must explain to the people that in most of the bourgeois revolutions of the usual type, this reform was always extremely short-lived, and that the bourgeoisie --  even the most democratic and republican -- restored the police of the old, tsarist type, a police divorced from the people, commanded hy the bourgeoisie and capable of oppressing the people in every way. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is only one way to <I>prevent</I> the restoration of the police, and that is to create a people's militia and to fuse it with the army (the standing army to be replaced by the arming of the entire people). Service in this militia should extend to all citizens of both sexes between the ages of fifteen and sixty-five without exception, if these tentatively suggested age limits may be taken as indicating the participation of adolescents and old people. Capitalists must pay their workers, servants, etc., for days devoted to public service in the militia. Unless women are brought to take an independent part not only in political life generally, but also in daily and universal public service, it is no use talking about full and stable democracy, let alone socialism. And such "police" functions as care of the sick and of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 71</B></FONT><P>

homeless children, food inspection, etc., will never be satisfactorily discharged until women are on an equal footing with men, not merely nominally but in reality. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The tasks which the proletariat must put before the people in order to safeguard, consolidate and develop the revolution are prevention of the restoration of the police and enlistment of the organisational forces of the entire people in forming a people's militia.

                           THE AGRARIAN AND NATIONAL PROGRAMMES
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  13.&nbsp;At the present moment we cannot say for certain whether a mighty agrarian revolution will develop in the Russian countryside in the near future. We cannot say exactly how profound the class cleavage is among the peasants, which has undoubtedly grown more profound of late as a division into agricultural labourers, wage-workers and poor peasants ("semi-proletarians"), on the one hand, and wealthy and middle peasants (capitalists and petty capitalists), on the other. Such questions will be, and can be, decided only by experience. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Being the party of the proletariat, however, we are unquestionably in duty bound not only immediately to advance an agrarian (land) programme but also to advocate practical measures which can be immediately realised in the <I>interests</I> of the peasant agrarian revolution in Russia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must demand the nationalisation of <I>all</I> the land, i.e., that all the land in the state should become the property of the central state power. This power must fix the size, etc., of the resettlement land fund, pass legislation for the conservation of forests, for land improvement, etc., and absolutely prohibit any middlemen to interpose themselves between the owner of the land, i.e., the state, and the tenant, i.e., the tiller (prohibit all subletting of land). However, the <I>disposal</I> of the land, the determination of the <I>local regulations</I> governing ownership and tenure of land, must in no case be placed in the hands of bureaucrats and officials, but wholly and exclusively in the hands of the regional and local <I>Soviets of Peasants' Deputies.</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 72</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In order to improve grain production techniques and increase output, and in order to develop rational cultivation on a large scale under public control, we must strive within the peasants' committees to secure the transformation of every confiscated landed estate into a large model farm controlled by the <I>Soviet of Agricultulal Labourers' Deputies.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In order to counteract the petty-bourgeois phrase-mongering and the policy prevailing among the Socialist-Revolutionaries, particularly the idle talk about "subsistence" standards or "labour" standards, "socialisation of the land", etc., the party of the proletariat must make it clear that small-scale farming under commodity production cannot save mankind from poverty and oppression. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Without necessarily splitting the Soviets of Peasants' Deputies at once, the party of the proletariat must explain the need for organising separate Soviets of Agricultural Labourers' Deputies and separate Soviets of deputies from the poor (semi-proletarian) peasants, or, at least, for holding regular separate conferences of deputies of <I>this class status</I><A NAME="p72"> in the shape of separate groups or parties within the general Soviets of Peasants' Deputies. Otherwise all the honeyed petty-bourgeois talk of the Narodniks<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en31">31</A>]</FONT> regarding the peasants in general will serve as a shield for the deception of the propertyless mass by the wealthy peasants, who are merely a variety of <I>capitalists.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To counteract the bourgeois-liberal or purely bureaucratic sermons preached by many Socialist-Revolutionaries and Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, who advise the peasants not to seize the landed estates and not to start the agrarian reform pending the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, the party of the proletariat must urge the peasants to carry out the agrarian reform at once on their own, and to confiscate the landed estates immediately, upon the decisions of the peasants' deputies in the localities. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the same time, it is most important to insist on the necessity of <I>increasing</I> food production for the soldiers at the front and for the towns, and on the absolute inadmissibility of causing any damage or injury to livestock, implements, machinery, buildings, etc. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 73</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  14.&nbsp;As regards the national question, the proletarian party first of all must advocate the proclamation and immediate realisation of complete freedom of secession from Russia for all the nations and peoples who were oppressed by tsarism, or who were forcibly joined to, or forcibly kept within the boundaries of, the state, i.e., annexed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All statements, declarations and manifestos concerning renunciation of annexations that are not accompanied by the realisation of the right of secession in practice, are nothing but bourgeois deception of the people, or else pious petty-bourgeois wishes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The proletarian party strives to create as large a state as possible, for this is to the advantage of the working people; it strives to <I>draw</I> nations <I>closer together</I>, and bring about their <I>further fusion </I>; but it desires to achieve this aim not by violence, but exclusively through a free fraternal union of the workers and the working people of all nations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The more democratic the Russian republic, and the more successfully it organises itself into a Republic of Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies, the more powerful will be the force of <I>voluntary</I> attraction to such a republic on the part of the working people of <I>all</I> nations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Complete freedom of secession, the broadest local (and national) autonomy, and elaborate guarantees of the rights of national minorities -- this is the programme of the revolutionary proletariat.

                                   AND CAPITALIST SYNDICATES
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  15.&nbsp;Under no circumstances can the party of the proletariat set itself the aim of "introducing" socialism in a country of small peasants so long as the overwhelming majority of the population has not come to realise the need for a socialist revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But only bourgeois sophists, hiding behind "near-Marxist" catchwords, can deduce from this truth a justification of the policy of postponing immediate revolutionary measures, the time for which is fully ripe; measures which 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 74</B></FONT><P>

<I>have been</I> frequently <I>resorted to during the war by a number of bourgeois states</I>, and which are absolutely indispensable in order to combat impending total economic disorganisation and famine. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such measures as the nationalisation of the land, of all the banks and capitalist syndicates, or, at least, the <I>immediate</I> establishment of the <I>control</I> of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies, etc., over them -- measures which do not in any way constitute the "introduction" of socialism -- must be absolutely insisted on, and, whenever possible, carried out in a revolutionary way. Without such measures, which are only steps towards socialism, and which are perfectly feasible economically, it will be impossible to heal the wounds caused by the war and to avert the impending collapse; and the party of the revolutionary proletariat will never hesitate to lay hands on the fabulous profits of the capitalists and bankers, who are enriching themselves on the war in a particularly scandalous manner.

                            WITHIN THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  16.&nbsp;The international obligations of the working class of Russia are precisely now coming to the forefront with particular force. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Only lazy people do not swear by internationalism these days. Even the chauvinist defencists, even Plekhanov and Potresov, even Kerensky, call themselves internationalists. It becomes the duty of the proletarian party all the more urgently, therefore, to clearly, precisely and definitely counterpose internationalism in deed to internationalism in word. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Mere appeals to the workers of all countries, empty assurances of devotion to internationalism, direct or indirect attempts to fix a "sequence" of action by the revolutionary proletariat in the various belligerent countries, laborious efforts to conclude "agreements" between the socialists of the belligerent countries <I>on the question</I> of the revolutionary struggle, all the fuss over the summoning of socialist congresses <I>for the purpose</I> of a peace campaign, etc., etc. -- no 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 75</B></FONT><P>

matter how sincere the authors of such ideas, attempts, and plans may be -- amount, as far as their <I>objective</I> significance is concerned, to mere phrase-mongering, and <I>at best</I> are innocent and pious wishes, fit only to conceal the <I>deception</I> of the people by the chauvinists. The <I>French</I> social-chauvinists, who are the most adroit and accomplished in methods of parliamentary hocus-pocus, have long since broken the record for ranting and resonant pacifist and internationalist phrases <I>coupled with</I> the incredibly brazen betrayal of socialism and the International, the acceptance of posts in governments which conduct the imperialist war, the voting of credits <I>or loans</I> (as Chkheidze, Skobelev, Tsereteli and Steklov have been doing recently in Russia), opposition to the revolutionary struggle in <I>their own country</I>, etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Good people often forget the brutal and savage setting of the imperialist world war. This setting does not tolerate phrases, and mocks at innocent and pious wishes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is one, and only one, kind of real internationalism, and that is -- working whole-heartedly for the development of the revolutionary movement and the revolutionary struggle in <I>one's own</I> country, and supporting (by propaganda, sympathy, and material aid) <I>this struggle</I>, this, and <I>only this</I>, line, in <I>every</I> country without exception. 
<A NAME="p75">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Everything else is deception and Manilovism.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en32">32</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   During the two odd years of the war the international socialist and working-class movement in <I>every</I> country has evolved three trends. Whoever ignores <I>reality</I> and refuses to recognise the existence of these three trends, to analyse them, to fight consistently for the trend that is really internationalist, is doomed to impotence, helplessness and errors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The three trends are: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   1).&nbsp;The social-chauvinists, i.e., socialists in word and chauvinists in deed. people who recognise "defence of the fatherland" in an imperialist war (and above all in the present imperialist war). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   These people are our <I>class</I> enemies. They have gone over to the bourgeoisie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   They are the majority of the official leaders of the official Social-Democratic parties in <I>all</I> countries -- Plekhanov 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 76</B></FONT><P>
<A NAME="p76">
and Co. in Russia, the Scheidemanns in Germany, Renaudel, Guesde and Sembat in France, Bissolati and Co. in Italy, Hyndman, the Fabians<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en33">33</A>]</FONT> and the Labourites (the leaders of the "Labour Party") in Britain, Branting and Co. in Sweden, Troelstra and his party in Holland, Stauning and his party in Denmark, Victor Berger and the other "defenders of the fatherland" in America, and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   2)&nbsp;The second trend, known as the "Centre", consists of people who vacillate beteen the social-chauvinists and the true internationalists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "Centre" all vow and declare that they are Marxists and internationalists, that they are for peace, for bringing every kind of "pressure" to bear upon the governments, for "demanding" in every way that their own government should "ascertain the will of the people for peace", that they are for all sorts of peace campaigns, for peace without annexations, etc., etc. -- <I>and for peace with the social-chauvinists</I>. The "Centre" is for "unity", the Centre is opposed to a split. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "Centre" is a realm of honeyed petty-bourgeois phrases, of internationalism in word and cowardly opportunism and fawning on the social-chauvinists in deed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The crux of the matter is that the "Centre" is not convinced of the necessity for a revolution against one's own government; it does not preach revolution; it does not carry on a whole-hearted revolutionary struggle; and in order to evade such a struggle it resorts to the tritest ultra-"Marxist"-sounding <I>excuses.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The social-chauvinists are our <I>class enemies</I>, they are <I>bourgeois</I> within the working-class movement. They represent a stratum, or groups, or sections of the working class which <I>objectively</I> have been bribed by the bourgeoisie (by better wages, positions of honour, etc.), and which help <I>their own</I> bourgeoisie to plunder and oppress small and weak peoples and to fight <I>for</I> the division of the capitalist spoils. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "Centre" consists of routine-worshippers, eroded by the canker of legality, corrupted by the parliamentary atmosphere, etc., bureaucrats accustomed to snug positions and soft jobs. Historically and economically speaking, they are not a <I>separate</I> stratum but represent only a <I>transition</I> from a past phase of the working-class movement -- the phase 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 77</B></FONT><P>

between 1871 and 1914, which gave much that is valuable to the proletariat, particularly in the indispensable art of slow, sustained and systematic organisational work on a large and very large scale -- to a new <I>phase</I> that became <I>objectively</I> essential with the outbreak of the first imperialist world war, which inaugurated <I>the era of social revolution.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The chief leader and spokesman of the "Centre" is Karl Kautsky, the most outstanding authority in the Second International (1889-1914), since August 1914 a model of utter bankruptcy as a Marxist, the embodiment of unheard-of spinelessness, and the most wretched vacillations and betrayals. This "Centrist" trend includes Kautsky, Haase,<A NAME="p77"> Ledebour and the so-called workers' or labour group<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en34">34</A>]</FONT> in the Reichstag; in France it includes Longuet, Pressemane and the so-called minoritaires<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en35">35</A>]</FONT> (Mensheviks) in general; in Britain, Philip Snowden,<A NAME="p77a"> Ramsay MacDonald and many other leaders of the Independent Labour Party,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en36">36</A>]</FONT> and some leaders of the British Socialist Party<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en37">37</A>]</FONT>; Morris Hillquit and many others in the United States; Turati, Tr&egraveves, Modigliani and others in Italy; Robert Grimm and others in Switzerland; Victor Adler and Co. in Austria; the party of the Organising Committee, Axelrod, Martov, Chkheidze, Tsereteli and others in Russia, and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Naturally, at times individuals unconsciously drift from the social-chauvinist to the "Centrist" position, and vice versa. Every Marxist knows that classes are distinct, even though individuals may move freely from one class to another; similarly, <I>trends</I> in political life are distinct in spite of the fact that individuals may change freely from one trend to another, and in spite of all attempts and efforts to <I>amalgamate</I> trends. 
<A NAME="p77b">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   3)&nbsp;The third trend, that of the true internationalists, is best represented by the "Zimmerwald Left".<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en38">38</A>]</FONT> (We reprint as a supplement its manifesto of September 1915, to enable the reader to learn of the inception of this trend at first hand.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Its distinctive feature is its complete break with both social-chauvinism and "Centrism", and its gallant revolutionary struggle against <I>its own</I> imperialist government and <I>its own</I> imperialist bourgeoisie. Its principle is: "Our chief enemy is at home." It wages a ruthless struggle against 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 78</B></FONT><P>

honeyed social-pacifist phrases (a social-pacifist is a socialist in word and a bourgeois pacifist in deed; bourgeois pacifists dream of an everlasting peace <I>without</I> the overthrow of the yoke and domination of capital) and against all <I>subterfuges</I> employed to deny the possibility, or the appropriateness, or the timeliness of a proletarian revolutionary struggle and of a proletarian socialist revolution <I>in connection</I> with the present war. 
<A NAME="p78">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The most outstanding representative of this trend in Germany is the Spartacus group or the <I>Internationale</I> group,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en39">39</A>]</FONT> to which Karl Liebknecht belongs. Karl Liebknecht is a most celebrated representative of this trend and of the <I>new</I>, and genuine, proletarian International. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Karl Liebknecht called upon the workers and soldiers of Germany to <I>turn their guns</I> against <I>their own</I> government. Karl Liebknecht did that openly from the rostrum of parliament (the Reichstag). He then went to a demonstration in Potsdamer Platz, one of the largest public squares in Berlin, with illegally printed leaflets proclaiming the slogan "Down with the Government!" He was arrested and sentenced to <I>hard labour</I>. He is now serving his term in a German convict prison, like <I>hundreds</I>, if not thousands, of other <I>true</I> German socialists who have been imprisoned for their anti-war activities. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Karl Liebknecht in his speeches and letters mercilessly attacked not only <I>his own</I> Plekhanovs and Potresovs (Scheidemanns, Legiens, Davids and Co.), <I>but also his own Centrists</I>, his own Chkheidzes and Tseretelis (Kautsky, Haase, Ledebour and Co.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Karl Liebknecht and his friend Otto R&uumlhle, two out of one hundred and ten deputies, violated discipline, destroyed the "unity" with the "Centre" and the chauvinists, and <I>went against all of them</I>. Liebknecht <I>alone</I> represents socialism, the proletarian cause, the proletarian revolution. All the rest of German Social-Democracy, to quote the apt words of Rosa Luxemburg (also a member and one of the leaders of the Spartacus group), is a "<I>stinking corpse </I>". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Another group of true internationalists in Germany is that of the Bremen paper <I>Arbeiterpolitik.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Closest to the internationalists in deed are: in France, Loriot and his friends (Bourderon and Merrheim have

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is not a question of shades of opinion, which certainly exist even among the Lefts. It is a question of <I>trend</I>. The thing is that it is not easy to be an internationalist in deed during a terrible imperialist war. Such people are few; but it is on such people <I>alone</I> that the future of socialism depends; they <I>alone</I> are <I>the leaders of the people</I>, and not their corrupters. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The distinction between the reformists and the revolutionaries, among the Social-Democrats, and socialists generally, was objectively bound to undergo a change under the conditions of the imperialist war. Those who confine themselves to "demanding" that the bourgeois governments should conclude peace or "ascertain the will of the peoples for peace", etc., are <I>actually</I> slipping into reforms. For, objectively, <I>the problem of the war</I> can be solved only in a <I>revolutionary way.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is no possibility of this war ending in a democratic, non-coercive peace or of the people being relieved of the burden of <I>billions</I> paid in interest to the capitalists, who have made fortunes out of the war, except through a revolution of the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The most variyd reforms can and must be demanded of the bourgeois governments, but one cannot, without sinking to Manilovism and reformism, demand that people and classes entangled by the thousands of threads of imperialist capital should <I>tear</I> those threads. And unless they are torn, all talk of a war against war is idle and deceitful prattle. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "Kautskyites", the "Centre", are revolutionaries in word and reformists in deed, they are internationalists in word and accomplices of the social-chauvinists in deed.

                    THE NEED FOR FOUNDING A THIRD INTERNATIONAL
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  17.&nbsp;From the very outset, the Zimmerwald International adopted a vacillating, "Kautskyite", "Centrist" position, which immediately compelled the <I>Zimmerwald Left</I> to dissociate itself, to separate itself from the rest, and to 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 81</B></FONT><P>

issue <I>its own</I> manifesto (published in Switzerland in Russian, German and French). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The chief shortcoming of the Zimmerwald International, and the cause of its <I>collapse</I> (for politically and ideologically it has already collapsed), was its vacillation and indecision on such a momentous issue of <I>crucial</I> practical significance as that of breaking completely with social-chauvinism and the old social-chauvinist International, headed by Vandervelde and Huysmans at The Hague (Holland), etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is not as yet known in Russia that the Zinmerwald majority <I>are nothing but Kautskyites</I>. Yet this is the fun damental fact, one which cannot be ignored, and which is now generally known in Western Europe. Even that chauvinist, that extreme German chauvinist, Heilmann,<A NAME="p81"> editor of the ultra-chauvinistic <I>Chemnitzer Volksstimme</I> and contributor to Parvus's ultra-chauvinistic <I>Glocke </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en47">47</A>]</FONT> (a "Social-Democrat", of course, and an ardent partisan of Social-Democratic "unity"), was compelled to acknowledge in the press that the Centre, or "Kautkyism", and the <I>Zimmerwald majority</I> were one and the same thing. 
<A NAME="p81a">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This fact was definitely established at the end of 1916 and the beginning of 1917. Although social-pacifism was condemned by the Kienthal Manifesto,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en48">48</A>]</FONT> the <I>whole</I> Zimmer wald Right, the <I>entire</I> Zimmerwald majority, sank to social-pacifism: Kautsky and Co. in a series of utterances in January and February 1917; Bourderon and Merrheim in France, who cast their votes <I>in unanimity</I> with the social-chauvinists for the pacifist resolutions of the Socialist Party (December 1916) and of the Conf&eacuted&eacuteration G&eacuten&eacuterale du Travail (the national organisation of the French trade unions, also in December 1916); Turati and Co. in Italy, where the entire party took up a social-pacifist position, while Turati himself, in a speech delivered on December 17, 1916, "slipped" (not by accident, of course) into <I>nationalist</I> phrases whitewashing the imperialist war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In January 1917, the chairman of the Zimmerwald and Kienthal conferences, Robert Grimm, joined the social-chauvinists in <I>his own</I> party (Greulich, Pfl&uumlger, Gustav M&uumlller and others) <I>against</I> the internationalists in deed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At two conferences of <I>Zimmerwaldists</I> from various countries in January and February 1917, this equivocal, double-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 82</B></FONT><P>

faced behaviour of the Zimmerwald majority was formally stigmatised by the Left internationalists of several countries: by Munzenberg,<A NAME="p82"> secretary of the international youth organisation and editor of the excellent internationalist publication <I>Die Jugendinternationale </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en49">49</A>]</FONT>; by Zinoviev, representative of the Central Committee of our Party; by K. Radek of the Polish Social-Democratic Party (the "Regional Executive"), and by Hartstein, a German Social-Democrat and member of the Spartacus group. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Much is given to the Russian proletariat; nowhere in the world has the working class yet succeeded in developing so much revolutionary energy as in Russia. But to whom much is given, of him much is required. 
<A NAME="p82a">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Zimmerwald bog can no longer be tolerated. We must not, for the sake of the Zimmerwald "Kautskyites", continue the semi-alliance with the chauvinist International of the Plekhanovs and Scheidemanns. We must break with this International immediately. We must remain in Zimmerwald only for purposes of information. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is we who must found, and right now, without delay, a new, revolutionary, proletarian International, or rather, we must not fear to acknowledge publicly that this new International is <I>already established</I> and operating. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is the International of those "internationalists in deed" whom I precisely listed above. They and they alone are representatives of the revolutionary, internationalist mass, and not their corrupters. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And if socialists <I>of that type</I> are few, let every Russian worker ask himself whether there were many really class-conscious revolutionaries in Russia <I>on the eve</I> of the February-March revolution of 1917. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is not a question of numbers, but of giving correct expression to the ideas and policies of the truly revolutionary proletariat. The thing is not to "proclaim" internationalism, but to be able to be an internationalist in deed, even when times are most trying. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us not deceive ourselves with hopes of agreements and international congresses. As long as the imperialist war is on, international intercourse is held in the iron vise of the military dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie. If even the "republican" Milyukov, who is obliged to 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 83</B></FONT><P>

tolerate the parallel government of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies, <I>did not allow Fritz Platten</I>, the Swiss socialist, secretary of the party, an internationalist and participant in the Zimmerwald and Kienthal conferences, to enter Russia in April 1917, in spite of the fact that Platten has a Russian wife and was on his way to visit his wife's relatives, and in spite of the fact that he had taken part in the revolution of 1905 in Riga, for which he had been confined in a Russian prison, had given bail to the tsarist government for his release and wished to recover that bail -- if the "republican" Milyukov could <I>do</I> such a thing in April 1917 in Russia, one can judge what value can be put on the promises and assurances, the phrases and declarations of the bourgeoisie on the subject of peace without annexations, and soon. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And the arrest of Trotsky by the British Government? And the refusal to allow Martov to leave Switzerland, and the attempt to lure him to Britain, where Trotsky's fate awaits him? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us harbour no illusions. We must not deceive ourselves. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To "wait" for international congresses or conferences is simply to <I>betray</I> internationalism, since it has been shown that even from Stockholm neither socialists loyal to internationalism <I>nor even their letters</I> are allowed to come here, although this is quite possible and although a ferocious military censorship exists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our Party must not "wait", but must immediately <I>found</I> a Third International. Hundreds of socialists imprisoned in Germany and Britain will then heave a sigh of relief, thousands and thousands of German workers who are now holding strikes and demonstrations that are frightening that scoundrel and brigand, Wilhelm, will learn from <I>illegal</I> leaflets of our decision, of our fraternal confidence in Karl Liebknecht, and in him alone, of <I>our</I> decision to fight "revolutionary defencism" <I>even now </I>; they will read this and be strengthened in their revolutionary internationalism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To whom much is given, of him much is required. No other country in the world is as free as Russia is <I>now</I>. Let us make use of this freedom, not to advocate support for the bourgeoisie, or bourgeois "revolutionary defencism", but in a bold, honest, proletarian, Liebknecht way to 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 84</B></FONT><P>

<I>found the Third International</I>, an International uncompromisingly hostile both to the social-chauvinlst traitors and to the vacillating "Centrists". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   18.&nbsp;After what has been said, there is no need to waste many words explaining that the amalgamation of Social-Democrats in Russia is out of the question. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is better to remain with one friend only, like Liebknecht, and <I>that means remaining with the revolutionary proletariat</I>, than to entertain even for a moment any thought of amalgamation with the party of the Organising Committee, with Chkheidze and Tsereteli, who can tolerate a bloc with Potresov in <I>Rabochaya Gazeta</I>,<A NAME="p84"> who voted for the loan in the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en50">50</A>]</FONT> and who have sunk to "defencism". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let the dead bury their dead.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  19.&nbsp;I now come to the final point, the name of our Party, We must call ourselves the <I>Communist Party</I> -- just as Marx and Engels called themselves. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must repeat that we are Marxists and that we take as our basis the <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/CM47.html">Communist Manifesto</A></I>, which has been distorted and betrayed by the Social-Democrats on two main points: (1) the working men have no country: "defence of the fatherland" in an imperialist war is a betrayal of socialism; and (2) the Marxist doctrine of the state has been distorted by the Second International. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The name "Social-Democracy" is <I>scientifically</I> incorrect, as Marx frequently pointed out, in particular,<A NAME="p84a"> in the <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/CGP75.html">Critique of the Gotha Programme</A></I> in 1875, and as Engels re-affirmed in a more popular form in 1894.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en51">51</A>]</FONT> From capitalism mankind can pass directly only to socialism, i.e., to the social ownership of the means of production and the distribution of products according to the amount of work 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 85</B></FONT><P>

performed by each individual. Our Party looks farther ahead: socialism must inevitably evolve gradually into communism, upon the banner of which is inscribed the motto, "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is my first argument. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is the second: the second part of the name of our Party (Social-<I>Democrats </I>) is also scientifically incorrect. Democracy is a form of <I>state</I>, whereas we Marxists are opposed to <I>every kind</I> of state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The leaders of the Second International (1889-1914), Plekhanov, Kautsky and their like, have vulgarised and distorted Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marxism differs from anarchism in that it recognises <I>the need for a state</I> for the purpose of the transition to socialism; but (and here is where we differ from Kautsky and Co.) <I>not a state of the type</I> of the usual parliamentary bourgeois-democratic republic, but a state like the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Soviets of Workers' Deputies of 1905 and 1917. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   My third argument: <I>living reality</I>, the revolution, has <I>already actually</I> established in our colmtry, albeit in a weak and embryonic form, precisely this new type of "state", which is not a state in the proper sense of the word. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is <I>already</I> a matter of the practical action of the people, and not merely a theory of the leaders. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The state in the proper sense of the term is domination over the people by contingents of armed men divorced from the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our <I>emergent</I>, new state is also a state, for we too need contingents of armed men, we too need the <I>strictest</I> order, and must <I>ruthlessly</I> crush by force all attempts at either a tsarist or a Guchkov-bourgeois counter-revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But our <I>emergent</I>, new state is <I>no longer</I> a state in the proper sense of the term, for in some parts of Russia these contingents of armed men are <I>the masses themselves</I>, the entire people, and not certain privileged persons placed over the people, and divorced from the people, and for all practical purposes undisplaceable. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must look forward, and not backward to the usual bourgeois type of democracy, which consolidated the rule of the bourgeoisie with the aid of tho old, <I>monarchist</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 86</B></FONT><P>

organs of administration, the police, the army and the bureaucracy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must look forward to the emergent new democracy, which is already ceasing to be a democracy, for democracy means the domination of the people, and the armed people cannot dominate themselves. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The term democracy is not only scientifically incorrect when applied to a Communist Party; it has now, since March 1917, simply become <I>blinkers</I> put on the eyes of the revolutionary people and <I>preventing</I> them from boldly and freely, on their own initiative, building up the new: the Soviets of Workers', Peasants', and all other Deputies, as <I>the sole power</I> in the "state" and as the harbinger of the "withering away" of the state <I>in every form.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   My fourth argument: we must reckon with the actual situation in which socialism finds itself internationally. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is not what it was during the years 1871 to 1914, when Marx and Engels knowingly put up with the inaccurate, opportunist term Social-Democracy". For <I>in those days</I>, after the defeat of the Paris Commune, history made slow organisational and educational work the task of the day. Nothing else was possible. The anarchists were then (as they are now) fundamentally wrong not only theoretically, but also economically and politically. The anarchists misjudged the character of the times, for they failed to understand the world situation: the worker of Britain corrupted by imperialist profits, the Commune defeated in Paris, the recent (1871) triumph of the bourgeois national movement in Germany, the age-long sleep of semi-feudal Russia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marx and Engels gauged the times accurately; they understood the international situation; they understood that the approach to the beginning of the social revolution must be <I>slow.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We, in our turn, must also understand the specific features and tasks of the new era.<A NAME="p86"> Let us not imitate those sorry Marxists of whom Marx said: "I have sown dragon's teeth and harvested fleas."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en52">52</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The objective inevitability of capitalism which grew into imperialism brought about the imperialist war. The war has brought mankind to the <I>brink of a precipice</I>, to the brink of the destruction of civilisation, of the brutalisation 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 87</B></FONT><P>

and destruction of more millions, countless millions, of human beings. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
 The <I>only</I> way out is through a proletarian revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the very moment when such a revolution is beginning, when it is taking its first hesitant, groping steps, steps betraying too great a confidence in the bourgeoisie, at such a moment the majority (that is the truth, that is a fact) of the "Social-Democratic" leaders, of the "Social-Democratic" parliamentarians, of the "Social-Democratic" newspapers -- and these are precisely the <I>organs</I> that influence the people -- have <I>deserted</I> socialism, have <I>betrayed</I> socialism and have gone over to the side of "their own" national bourgeoisie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The people have been confused, led astray and deceived by <I>these</I> leaders. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And we shall aid and abet that deception if we retain the old and out-of-date Party name, which is as decayed as the Second International! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Granted that "many" workers <I>understand</I> Social-Democracy in an honest way; but it is time to learn how to distinguish the subjective from the objective. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Subjectively, such Social-Democratic workers are most loyal leaders of the proletarians. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Objectively, however, the world situation is such that the old name of our Party <I>makes it easier</I> to fool the people and impedes the onward march; for at every step, in every paper, in every parliamentary group, the masses see <I>leaders</I>, i.e., people whose voices carry farthest and whose actions are most conspicuous; yet they are all "would-be Social-Democrats", they are all "for unity" with the betrayers of socialism, with the social-chauvinists; and they are all presenting for payment the old bills issued by "Social-Democracy". . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And what are the arguments against? . . . We'll be confused with the Anarchist-Communists, they say. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Why are we not afraid of being confused with the Social-Nationalists, the Social-Liberals, or the Radical-Socialists, the foremost bourgeois party in the French Republic and the most adroit in the bourgeois deception of the people? . . . We are told: The people are used to it, the workers have come to "love" <I>their</I> Social-Democratic Party. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 88</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  That is the only argument. But it is an argument that dismisses the science of Marxism, the tasks of the morrow in the revolution, the objective position of world socialism, the shameful collapse of the Second International, and the harm done to the practical cause by the packs of "would-be Social-Democrats" who surround the proletarians. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is an argument of routinism, an argument of inertia, an argument of stagnation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But we are out to rebuild the world. We are out to put an end to the imperialist world war into which hundreds of millions of people have been drawn and in which the interests of billions and billions of capital are involved, a war which cannot end in a truly democratic peace without the greatest proletarian revolution in the history of mankind. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Yet we are afraid of our own selves. We are loth to cast off the "dear old" soiled shirt. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But it is time to cast off the soiled shirt and to put on clean linen.

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   My pamphlet has become out of date owing to the general economic disorganisation and the inefficiency of the St. Petersburg presses. The pamphlet was written on April 10, 1917, today is May 28, and it has not come out yet! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  It was written as a <I>draft</I> platform to propagandise my views <I>before</I> the All-Russia Conference of our Party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party of Bolsheviks. The pamphlet was typed in several copies and handed out to Party members before and during the Conference so that it did its job in part. But the Conference took place from April 24 to April 29,<A NAME="p89"> 1917, its resolutions have long since been published (see supplement to <I>Soldatskaya Pravda</I> No. 13<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en53">53</A>]</FONT>) and the attentive reader will have noticed that my pamphlet often served as the original draft of those resolutions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is left for me to express the hope that the pamphlet will still be of some value because of its connection with those resolutions and because it explains them, and to deal here with two points. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I suggested on page 27 that we remain in Zimmerwald only for purposes of information.* The Conference did not agree with me on this point, and I had to vote against the resolution on the International. It is now becoming obvious that the Conference made a mistake and that the course taken by events will soon correct it. By remaining in Zimmerwald we (even against our will) are helping delay the creation of the Third International; we are indirectly hampering its foundation, being burdened with the dead ballast of the ideologically and politically dead Zimmerwald.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In the eyes of the working-class parties of the whole world, our Party's position is now such that it is our <I>duty</I> to <I>found</I> a Third International without delay. <I>Today</I> there is nobody but us to do it, and procrastination can only do harm. If we remain in Zimmerwald for information only, we shall have our hands freed to establish the new International (and at the same time be able to <I>use</I> Zimmerwald should circumstances make it possible). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Because of the mistake made by the Conference, we must now wait passively, at least until July 5, 1917 (the date set for the Zimmerwald Conference, provided it is not postponed <I>again </I>! It has already been postponed once. . .). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The decision unanimously adopted by the Central Committee of our Party after the Conference and published in <I>Pravda</I> No. 55, on May 12, has, however, gone half-way towards correcting the mistake; it has been resolved that we shall walk out of Zimmerwald if they decide to confer with ministers.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#fnp90">*</A>]</FONT> I express the hope that the other half of the mistake will be speedily remedied, as soon as we convene the first international conference of Lefts (the "third trend", the "internationalists in deed", see above, pp. 23-25 <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#fnp90">**</A>]</FONT>). 
<A NAME="p90">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The second point I must deal with is the formation of the "coalition cabinet" on May 6, 1917.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en54">54</A>]</FONT> On this point the pamphlet may <I>seem</I> to be particularly out of date. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But actually on this of all points it is not out of date at all. It is based <I>wholly</I> on the <I>class</I> analysis, a thing that the Mensheviks and Narodniks, who have provided six ministers as hostages to the ten capitalist ministers, stand in deadly fear of.

the capitalists, that the "renewed" government is neither willing nor able to carry out any of its abundant promises either in foreign or domestic policies. Chernov, Tsereteli and Co. have committed political suicide by turning into assistants of the capitalists, into people who are actually strangling the revolution; Kerensky has come so low as to use force against the masses (cf.<A NAME="p91"> p. 9 of the pamphlet: "Guchkov is still only threatening to employ violence against the mass"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#fnp91">*</A>]</FONT> but Kerensky <I>had</I> to carry out those threats<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TPOR17.html#en55">55</A>]</FONT>). Chernov, Tsereteli and Co. have killed themselves and their parties -- the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolution aries -- politically. The people will realise this more and more clearly as the days go by. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The coalition cabinet is only a passing moment in the development of the fundamental class contradictions of our rovolution briefly analysed in the pamphlet. This situation cannot last long -- we must either go backward to counter-revolution all along the line or forward to the transfer of state power to other classes. At a time of revolution, when the imperialist world war is in progress, we cannot stand still.

Cadets -- (abbreviated) members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the chief party of the liberal monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia. Founded in October 1905, its membership was made up of representatives of the bourgeoisie, Zemstvo leaders of the landowning class and bourgeois intellectuals. Among the leading personalities of the party were P. N. Milyukov, S. A. Muromtsev V. A. Maklakov, A. I. Shingaryov, P. B. Struve and F. I. Rodichev. Eventually, the Cadets became a party of the imperialist bourgeoisie. During the First World War they fully supported the tsarist government's aggressive foreign policy. During the bourgeois-democratic revolution of February 1917 they tried their hardest to save the monarchy. They used their key positions in the bourgeois Provisional Government to pursue a counter revolutionary policy opposed to the interests of the people, but favouring the U.S., British and French imperialists. After the victory of the October Revolution the Cadets came out as implacable enemies of the Soviet power. They took part in all the counter-revolutionary armed actions and campaigns of the interventionists. Living abroad as &eacutemigr&eacutes after the defeat of the interventionists and whiteguards, the Cadets did not cease their anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary activities.

   <I>Trudoviks</I> (the Trudovik group) -- a group of petty-bourgeois democrats in the Russian Duma consisting of peasants and intellectuals of a Narodnik trend. The Trudovik group was formed in April 1906 by peasant deputies to the First Duma. In the Duma the Trudoviks vacillated between the Cadets and the revolutionary Social-Democrats. During the First World War most of the Trudoviks took a social-chauvinist stand. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   After the bourgeois-democratic revolution of February 1917 the Trudoviks, representiny the interests of the kulaks, actively supported the Provisional Government. The Trudovik Zarudny, who became Minister of Justice after the July events, persecuted the Bolshevik Party. The Trudoviks were enemies of the October Revolution and sided with the bourgeois counter-revolution.

   Lenin refers to the <I>Fabian Society</I>, an English reformist organisation, founded in 1884, so called after the Roman General Quintus Fabius Maximus (III century B.C.) surnamed Cunctator (Procrastinator) for his mark-time tactics and evasion of decisive battles in the war with Hannibal. The membership of the Fabian Society consisted chiefly of bourgeois intellectuals -- scholars, writers and politicians (the Webbs, Ramsay MacDonald, Bernard Shaw and others). They denied the need for the proletariat's class struggle and a socialist revolution, and maintained that the transition from capitalism to socialism could be brought about by means of minor and gradual reforms. Lenin described Fabianism as "an <I>extremely opportunist</I> trend --  (see present edition, Vol. 13, p. 358&nbsp; [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>Transcriber's Note</I></FONT>: See Lenin's <I><A HREF="APFR07NB.html">The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution</I>, <I>1905-1907</A></I>. -- <FONT SIZE=-2><I>DJR</I></FONT>]). In 1900 the Fabian Society joined the Labour Party. Fabian socialism is one of the sources of Labour Party ideology. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   During the First World War (1914-18) the Fabians took a social-chauvinist stand.

Eventually, in 1917, it formed the core of the Centrist Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, which sought to justify the overt social-chauvinists and stood for preserving unity with them.

   <I>Minoritaires</I> or <I>Longuetists</I> -- the minority of the French Socialist Party formed in 1915. The minoritaires were followers of the social-reformist Longuet; they held Centrist views and pursued a conciliatory policy towards the soclal-chauvinists. During the First World War they took a social-pacifist stand. After the victoryof the October Revolution in Russia they declared themselves adherents of the dictatorship of the proletariat, but in reality they were against it. They continued the policy of co-operation with the social-chauvinists and supported the annexationist Treaty 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 584</B></FONT><P>

of Versailles. Finding themselves in a minority at the congress of the French Socialist Party held in Tours in December 1920 where the Left wing won ascendancy, the Longuetists together with the open reformists split away from the party and joined the Two-and-a-Half International, and after its break-down returned to the Second International.

   The <I>Independent Labour Party</I> -- a reformist organisation founded by the leaders of the "new trade unions" in 1893 during the active strike movement and the mounting drive for independence of the British working class from the bourgeois parties. The membership of the I.L.P. consisted of the "new trade unionists" and members of some of the old trade unions, as well as intellectuals and petty bourgeois holding Fabian views. The leaders of the Party were James Keir Hardie and Ramsay MacDonald. From the day it was founded the I.L.P. took a bourgeois-reformist stand, devoting its chief attention to parliamentary forms of struggle and parliamentary deals with the Liberal Party. In the words of Lenin, the Independent Labour Party was "actually an opportunist party that has always been dependent on the bourgeoisie" (see V. I. Lenin, <I>On Britain</I>, Moscow, p. 401) 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   On the outbreak of the imperialist world war the I L.P. issued a manifesto against the war, but shortly afterwards adopted a social-chauvinist stand.

   The <I>British Socialist Party</I> was founded in 1911 in Manchester as a result of the amalgamation of the Social-Democratic Party with other socialist groups. The B.S.P. carried on propaganda in the spirit of Marxist ideas, it was "not opportunist and was <I>really</I> independent of the Liberals" (see present edition, Vol. 19 p. 273). Owing to its small membership and poor contact with the masses, however, it was somewhat sectarian in character. During the First World War a sharp struggle developed in the party between the internationalist trend (William Gallacher Albert Inkpin, John MacLean, Theodore Rothstein and others) and the social-chauvinist trend headed by Hyndman. There were inconsistent elements within the internationalist trend who took a Centrist stand on a number of issues. In February 1916 a group of the party's active members founded the newspaper <I>The Call</I> which played an important part in uniting the internationalists. The annual conference of the B.S.P. held at Salford in April 1916 condemned the social-chauvinist stand taken by Hyndman and his adherents, and they left the Party. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The British Socialist Party hailed the October Revolution, and its members played a great part in the British working people's movement in defence of Soviet Russia against foreign intervention. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   In 1919 the majority of the Party organisations (98 against 4) declared in favour of joining the Communist International. The B.S.P., together with the Communist Unity Group, played a leading role in the formation of the Communist Party of Great

Britain. At the First (Unity) Congress held in 1920 the overwhelming majority of the B.S.P. Iocals joined the Communist Party.

   The <I>Zimmerwald Left group</I> was founded on Lenin's initiative at the International Socialist Conference held in Zimmerwald in September 1915. It consisted of delegates from the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., the Left Social-Democrats of Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Germany, the Polish Social-Democratic opposition and the Social-Democrats of the Latvian area. The Zimmerwald Left group, headed by Lenin, waged a struggle against the Centrist majority of the Conference and moved resolutions condemning the imperialist war, exposing the betrayal by the social-chauvinists, and urging the necessity of active struggle against the war. These draft resolutions were rejected by the Centrist majority. The Zimmerwald Left succeeded, however, in getting a number of important points from its own draft resolution included in the manifesto adopted by tho Conference. Regarding this manifesto as a first step in the fight against the war, the Zimmerwald Left voted for it, and in a special statement pointed out the inadequacy and inconsistency of the manifesto and their reasons for voting for it. They declared that while remaining within the Zimmerwald organisation they would disseminate their views and work independently on an international scale. The group elected an executive body -- a Bureau, consistin of Lenin, Zinoviev and Radek. The Zimmerwald Left published a journal <I>Vorbote</I> (<I>Herald </I>) in German, which carried a number of articles by Lenin. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Bolsheviks, the only group to take a consistent internationalist stand, were the guiding force in the Zimmerwald Left. Lenin opposed Radek's opportunist waverings and criticised the mistakes of other Leftists. The Zimmerwald Left soon became the rallying point for internationalist elements of world Social-Democracy. At the Second International Socialist Conference in April 1916 in Kienthal, Switzerland, the Zimmerwald Left had 12 out of the 43 delegates to the Conference, and on a number of issues obtained nearly half of the total votes. The Social-Democrats of various countries who belonged to the Zimmerwald Left group carried on active revolutionary work and played an important role in the establishment of Communist parties in their countries. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   On the Zimmerwald Left see Lenin's articles: "The First Step", "Revolutionary Marxists at the International Socialist Conference, September 5-8, 1915" (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 383-93).

   The <I>Internationale</I> group, later called the Spartacus League, was formed by the German Left Social-Democrats Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin and others at the beginning of the First World War. The group played an important part in the history of the German labour movement. At the national conference of Left Social-Democrats held in 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 586</B></FONT><P>

January 1916 the eroup adopted the thesis concerning the tasks of international Social-Democracy drafted and proposed by Rosa Luxemburg. The <I>Internationale</I> group carried on revolutionary propaganda among the masses against the imperialist war exposing the aggressive policy of German imperialism and the treachery of the leaders of Social-Democracy. The group was not free, however, from serious errors on the most important questions of theory and policies: it rejected the principle of self-determination of nations in its Marxist interpretation (that is, including the right of secession and the formation of a separate state) denied the possibility of national liberation wars in the epoch of imperialism, and underestimated the role of the revolutionary party, so on. Lenin criticised the errors of the German Lefts in his articles: "<A HREF="JP16.html">The Junius Pamphlet</A>", "<A HREF="MPPR16.html">The War Programme of the Proletarian Revolution</A>" and others (see present edition Vols. 22 and 23). In 1917 the <I>Internationale</I> group became affiliated to the Centrist Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany preserving its organisational independence. After the November revolution in Germany in 1918 it broke with the "Independents" and in December of the same year founded the Communist Party of Germany.

   The <I>Socialist Labour Party of America</I> was founded in 1876 at the unity congress held in Philadelphia as a result of the amalgamation of the American sections of the First International and other socialist organisations. A leading part at the congress was played by F. A. Sorge, an associate of Marx and Engels. The over whelming majority of the party were immigrants who had poor contacts with the American working class. During the early years the party was controlled by the Lassalleans who made mistakes of a sectarian and dogmatic nature. Some of the party's leaders considered parliamentary activity to be the chief task of the party and underestimated the importance of leadership of the economic struggle of the masses; others slid down to trade-unionism and anarchism. The ideological and tactical waverings of the leaders weakened the party and led to a number of groups dropping away from it. Marx and Engels sharply criticised the sectarianism of the American socialists. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the nineties the leadership of the party was assumed by the Left wing, headed by D. De Leon, but this group, too, committed errors of an anarcho-syndicalist nature. The S.L.P. withdrew from the struggle for satisfaction of partial demands of the working class, withdrew from work in the reformist trade unions and gradually lost its already weakened contacts with the mass labour movement. Duriny the First World War (1914-18) the S.L.P. Ieaned towards internationalism. Under the impact of the October Revolution in Russia the more revolutionary section of the S.L.P. took an active part in organising the Communist Party of America. Today the S.L.P. is a small organisation having no influence on the labour movement in the U.S.A.

   The <I>Socialist Party of America</I> was formed in July 1901 at the congress in Indianapolis as a result of the amalgamation of groups that had split away from the Socialist Labour Party and the Social-Democratic Party of the U.S.A., one of whose organisers was Eugene Debs, a popular leader of the American labour movement; he was one of the founders of the new party. The party had a mixed social composition, being made up of American workers immigrant workers, as well as small farmers and petty bourgeois. The Centrist and Right opportunist leadership of the party (Victor L. Berger, Morris Hillquit and others) denied the need for a dictatorship of the proletariat, rejecting revolutionary methods of struggle, and reduced the activities of the party mainly to participation in election campaigns. During the First World War three trends appeared in the S.P. -- the social-chauvinists who supported the government's imperialist policy, the Centrists who paid only lip-service to the cause of anti-imperialism, and the revolutionary minority, who took an internationalist stand and were actively anti-war. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Left wing of the Socialist Party headed by Charles Ruthenberg, William Foster, William Haywood and others, and backed by the proletarian membership, waged a struggle against the party's opportunist leadership and for independent political action by the proletariat, for the creation of industrial trade unions based on the principles of the class struggle. In 1919 a split occurred in the Socialist Party. The breakaway Left wing took the lead in forming the Communist Party of America, of which it was the core. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the present time the Socialist Party is a small sectarian organisation.

The leaders of the Tribunists were David Wijnkoop, Herman Gorter, Anton Pannekoek, and Henriette Roland-Holst. The Tribunists were not a consistently revolutionary party, but they represented the Left wing of the Dutch labour movement, and during the First World War (1914-18) they adopted, in the main, an internationalist stand.

   On April 7(20), 1917, the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, by a majority of 21 votes against 14, adopted a resolution in favour of supporting the so-called "Liberty Loan" issued by the Provisional Government to finance the continuing imperialist war. The Bolshevik members of the Executive Committee opposed this loan, declaring that support of it was "the worst form of 'civil truce'" and moved a resolution containing a detailed statement of their position. Several members of the E.C. not belonying to the Bolshevik group voted with the Bolsheviks. The

   The coalition Provisional Government was formed as a result of the crisis caused by the Note which Milyukov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had sent to the Allied governments on April 18 (May 1), 1917, confirming the Provisional Government's readiness to honour all the treaties which the tsarist government had concluded with the imperialist powers -- Britain and France. Owing to the spontaneous demonstrations of protest, which reached a head on April 20 and 21 (May 3 and 4) in a powerful movement of the workers and soldiers, the Provisional Government, to create the appearance of a change in policy, accepted the resignation of Foreign Minister Milyukov, and War Minister Guchkov, and made a proposal to the Petrograd Soviet to form a coalition government. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   Despite its decision of March 1 (14) forbidding members of the Soviet to join the Provisional Government, the Executive Committee, at a special meeting held on the night of May 1 (14), accepted the proposal of the Provisional Government. At the preliminary meetings of the party groups the Bolsheviks were the only group to come out against it. The decision to have representatives of the Soviet join the government was carried by 44 votes to 19 with two abstentions. A commission authorised to negotiate the terms for forming a coalition government was elected, consisting of Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Dan, Bogdanov (Mensheviks), Stankevich, Bramson (Trudoviks), Gots, Chernov (S.R.s), Kamenev (Bolshevik), Yurenev (member of the Inter-District group), and Sukhanov (independent Social-Democrat). On the evening of May 2 (15) an emergency meeting of the Petrograd Soviet was called at which the action of the Executive Committee was approved by a majority vote. After the negotiations an agreement was reached on May 5 (18) for the distribution of posts in the new government as a result of which 6 socialist ministers were to join the cabinet, namely: Kerensky -- War and Naval Minister, Skobelev -- Labour

Minister, Chernov -- Minister of Agriculture, Peshekhonov -- Minister of Food Supply, Tsereteli -- Minister of Post and Telegraph and Pereverzev -- Minister of Justice. On the evening of May 5(18) the Petrograd Soviet, after hearing Skobelev's report on the results of the negotiations with the Provisional Government, decided to have its representatives join the government on condition that they were answerable and accountable to the Soviet, and expressed full confidence in the new government. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   Lenin wrote afterwards that by joining the bourgeois government, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks "saved it from collapse and allowed themselves to be made its servants and defenders" (see present edition, Vol. 25, p. 237&nbsp; [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>Transcriber's Note</I></FONT>: See Lenin's "<A HREF="LR17.html#s6">Lessons of the Revolution</A>". -- <FONT SIZE=-2><I>DJR</I></FONT>]).

   Lenin is referring to the order by War Minister Kerensky published on May 11 (24), 1917, containing a "Declaration of the Rights of the Soldier", in which there was a point allowing a superior officer to use military force in cases of insubordination in the field. This point was aimed against soldiers and officers who refused to go into the attack. Simultaneously with the promulgation of this order Kerensky started to disband regiments and prosecute officers and soldiers guilty of "inciting to insubordina
tion".
