Copy to Comrades Kamenev and Zinoviev

<P>
Dear Comrade Stalin:

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  You have been so rude as to summon my wife to the telephone and use bad language. Although she had told

* A separate sheet, appended to the present letter, contains this note by a secretary: "Comrade Trotsky: To the letter communicated to you by phone, Vladimir Ilyich asked to add for your information that Comrade Kamenev is going to Georgia on Wednesday, and wants to know whether you wish to send anything there yourself. March 5, 23." --<I>Ed.</I>&nbsp; [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>Transcriber's Note</I></FONT>: The asterisks preceding the title of this document is undoubtedly an editorial error. The content of the forgoing editorial note belongs with <A HREF="LLDT23.html">Document 812</A>, the letter "To L. D. Trotsky". -- <FONT SIZE=-2><I>DJR</I></FONT>]

you that she was prepared to forget this, the fact nevertheless became known through her to Zinoviev and Kamenev. I have no intention of forgetting so easily what has been done against me, and it goes without saying that what has been done against my wife I consider having been done against me as well. I ask you, therefore, to think it over whether you are prepared to withdraw what you have said and to make your apologies, or whether you prefer that relations between us should be broken off.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LTCS23.html#en767">767</A>]</FONT>

   A reference to the following fact. After Lenin, with the permission of his doctors, had, on December 21, 1922, dictated a letter to Trotsky on the foreign trade monopoly (see this volume, <A HREF="LLDT23.html">Document 811</A>&nbsp;["To L. D. Trotsky"]), J. V. Stalin, whom a C.C. Plenum decision of December 18 had made personally responsible for the observance of the medical regimen ordered for Lenin, used offensive language

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 758</B></FONT><P>

against Nadezhda Krupskaya and threatened to take the case to the Control Commission for having taken down the said letter. On December 23, 1922, Krupskaya sent Kamenev a letter asking for protection from "the gross interference in my personal life, offensive language and threats". 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Nadezhda Krupskaya apparently told Lenin of this fact in earl March 1923. Having learned about this Lenin dictated the document here published. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Maria Ulyanova later wrote in a letter to the presidium of the Central Control Commission of the R.C.P.(B.), at which the question had been raised by G. Y. Zinoviev, one of the leaders of the "new opposition", that Stalin had offered his apologies.
