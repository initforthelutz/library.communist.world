                         HOW PLEKHANOV AND CO. DEFEND REVISIONISM<P><BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The editorial comment in <I>Golos Sotsial-Demokrata</I>, i.e., by Plekhanov and Co., on our analysis of Comrade Maslov's letter<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="HPDR08.html#fnp281">*</A>]</FONT> in <I>Proletary</I>, No. 37, has now appeared as a separate supplement to No. 8-9 of <I>Golos.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This "Comment", in length about half a column of <I>Proletary</I>, merits the attention of Russian Social-Democrats, for it shows how petty factional interests have led Plekhanov and Co. to <I>defend</I> theoretical revisionism with the aid of the most unseemly sophistry. Here are the facts. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "We are the most determined and absolutely irreconcilable opponents of that <I>re-examination</I> (revision) of Marxism which is being performed under the reactionary influence of the ideologists of the West-European bourgeoisie and whose object is to strike at the roots of the philosophical, sociological, and economic doctrines of Marx and Engels." That is the first sentence of the comment. "Most determined and absolutely irreconcilable opponents" -- could it be put more sharply? It would be hard to produce a more grandiloquent formula for the <I>promises</I> of Plekhanov and Co. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But . . . the trouble is that our "irreconcilable" enemies of revisionism resort to a very meaningful "but" <I>in relation to Maslov</I> (and Plekhanov and Co. wrote this Comment precisely in connection with Maslov's article, precisely on the question of Maslov's revisionism). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "But we have never been Marxist sectarians," Plekhanov and Co. declare, "and we realise only too well that one can differ from Marx and Engels on one question or another,

and far from perverting their point of view or repudiating their method, remain true to both." And this example is cited: Cunow, a Social-Democrat, had "partial differences with Engels" on the question of "the origin of the matriarchate", but "only a morbid mind could accuse him of revisionism on these grounds". 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "The foregoing holds good also for our attitude to Comrade Maslov's views on Marx's theory of rent. We do not share this view" (<I>Golos</I> adds editorially: "Comrade Martynov made the specific reservation in No. 1 of <I>Golos</I> that he did not agree with Comrade Maslov's amendment to the theory of absolute rent"), "but we do not regard it as revisionism. . . ."

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The reader can now follow the Plekhanov and Co. trend of reasoning. We are "absolutely irreconcilable opponents of revisionism", <I>but</I> -- "we do not regard it [Maslov's view on the theory of absolute rent] as revisionism". Revisionism strikes at the roots of Marx's doctrine, whereas Maslov differs with Marx on a partial issue -- such is the line of defence taken by Plekhanov and Co., and fully amplified by the reference to Cunow. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We ask the unbiased and thinking reader: is this not sophistry? Marx's theory of absolute rent is declared a "partial issue"! Differences on his theory of rent are <I>equated</I> with the fact that Cunow had "partial differences" with Engels on the origin of the matriarchate! Plekhanov and Co. apparently consider their Mensheviks little children to be fed on such explanations. One has to have no respect for oneself or for one's reader to play the clown like this in discussing cardinal questions of principle. Plekhanov and Co. themselves begin their explanation with a solemn phrase in which revisionism is described as striking at the roots of Marx's and Engels's doctrine. Very well. But do Plekhanov and Co. renounce <I>that</I> attitude in the case of Maslov? Yes or no? Or have Plekhanov and Co. penned their comment only to <I>conceal</I> their thoughts? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Maslov has declared, in a number of articles and in several editions of his <I>Agrarian Question</I>, that (1) Marx's theory of absolute rent is wrong; (2) the appearance of such a theory is due to the "rough" nature of Volume III (3) "diminishing returns" are a <I>fact </I>; (4) if the theory of

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 283</B></FONT><P>

absolute rent were correct and the "law of diminishing returns" wrong, the Narodniks in Russia and the revisionists the world over might prove to be right. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   These were the four points which were held against Maslov in the <I>Proletary</I> article from which the whole polemic began. But just see how Plekhanov and Co. react. First, they very modestly confine themselves to the question of rent, i.e., they maintain complete silence on all the other questions. Is this not defence of revisionism? Are Plekhanov and Co. going to deny that the revision of Marx's theory about the absurdity of both the law and "fact" of diminishing returns "is being performed under the reactionary influence of the ideologists of the West-European bourgeoisie"? Secondly, the theory of absolute rent is equated with a partial question, with differences ("partial") over the origin of the matriarchate! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This, gentlemen, is mental acrobatics! And you are using them to conceal your public defence of revisionism. For <I>you do not venture</I> to state openly that recognition of absolute rent and negation of the law (or "fact") of diminishing returns are <I>not</I> the "<I>roots </I>" of Marx's economic doctrine on the agrarian question. You defend your "own chap" by adjusting Marx to fit Maslov, by declaring that, in <I>Maslov's case</I>, the very <I>roots</I> of Marx's <I>theory</I> are no more than a matter of "partial differences". You thereby confirm what <I>Proletary</I> (No. 33*) said about the Menshevik theoretical Famusovs,** who reward their household by agreeing to regard Marx's economic <I>theory</I> as a "partial" question and by putting it on a par with the question of the origin of the matriarchate. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Plekhanov and Co. are "irreconcilable enemies of revisionism" -- but if you are a Menshevik, don't be afraid of these dread words! You can go to the <I>Golos</I> editors, knowing that for Mensheviks irreconcilability is very reconcilable -- so much so that they are prepared to equate "uprooting of theory" with "differences over the origin of the matriarchate". Indulgences are being offered cheap, ladies and gentlemen, the sale is on!

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But to continue. We do not share Maslov's views on rent, say Plekhanov and Co. Martynov has already made a reservation to that effect, they add. The "individual" whom the editors of <I>Proletary</I> described as "Maslov's guardian angel" (i.e., Plekhanov), has "often [listen to this!] <I>polemised in the press</I> [<I>Golos</I> italics] with Comrade Maslov on subjects closely related to our agrarian programme". 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   That, literally, is what Plekhanov and Co. say in their "Comment"! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Learn from your editors how to write disclaimers, Menshevik comrades. Here you have a classical example. The point at issue is revisionism, and the controversy began about whether it was theoretical irreconcilability or <I>only</I> petty factional spite that made Plekhanov refer to several of his opponents, in the Party organ, as "Messrs." But the "disclaimer" says: Plekhanov "often polemised in the press" with Maslov, but <I>not about the rent theory and not</I> about Maslov's deviations from Marxian theory. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Is there a suitable parliamentary expression to describe such methods? Plekhanov, who is a lover of theoretical controversies, and is able, on occasion, to turn them into campaigns, has <I>never</I>, <I>not once</I>, <I>polemised</I> with Maslov about what constitutes his revisionism, i.e., his negation of the absolute rent theory, his describing it as a "rough note", his defence of the "fact" of diminishing returns, or about whether or not the Narodniks and revisionists might have proved to be right if Maslov had not refuted Marx. Not once did Plekhanov argue on <I>these points </I>: he polemised about something quite different, namely, side issues, which the Menshevik Tartuffes* have now concealed behind a subtly hazy, deliberately misleading and diplomatically confused phrase: "subjects closely related to our agrarian programme"! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Brilliant, what? One cannot help congratulating Plekhanov and Co. on this opening defence of revisionism! One cannot help recalling politicians of the Clemenceau stamp. Clemenceau, "irreconcilable" enemy of reaction, "often polemised" with it, but now, with reaction in the

saddle, Clemenceau makes reservations and . . . serves it. Plekhanov is an "irreconcilable" enemy of revisionism. Plekhanov has "often polemised" with Maslov (on every imaginable subject <I>except</I> Maslov's revisionism). And now Maslov has come out against Marx, repeating his old arguments against the Marxian theory in the pages of <I>Golos</I>, but Plekhanov and Co. only make <I>reservations </I>! 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Buy your indulgences, literary gentlemen, sign up with the Mensheviks! Tomorrow you will be given the opportunity to refute Marx's theory of value as well in the pages of <I>Golos</I> -- with the reservation in a comment by the editors that they "are not in agreement". . . . 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Will not <I>Proletary</I> endeavour," Plekhanov and Co. ask in the same Comment, "'to substantiate its remark' about the connection between Maslov's reflections on absolute rent and the programme which repudiates nationalisation?" With the greatest of pleasure, dear "irreconcilables". Here is a brief first <I>substantiation</I> to start with: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Is it possible, while failing to understand Marx's theory of absolute rent, to appreciate the role of private property in land as an obstacle to the development of the productive forces of capitalist society?" 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Consult Maslov, "irreconcilable" Plekhanov and Co., and answer <I>that</I> question, which gives you the substantiation you want!
