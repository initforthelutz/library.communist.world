                                               THE DUMA "SEVEN"<P><BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The long-winded statements and arguments of the seven deputies to the State Duma in defence of liquidationism create a very strange impression. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All the time the seven discuss <I>solely</I> Duma activities, Social-Democratic activities in the <I>Duma </I>! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Outside of the Taurida Palace <I>nothing</I> of an organised character exists for the seven! "We, the seven of us, decided; we and Jagiello voted; we appointed speakers; we adopted a declaration"‹this is all one hears from the seven. "We members of the Duma", "we in the Duma"‹except for this, the seven know and understand nothing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The seven have already become so thoroughly infected with liquidationist views that they have ceased to understand the ABC of Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   According to Marxist standards, deputies to the Duma should <I>not</I> carry out <I>their own</I> will, but the will of the Marxist organisation, <I>not their own</I> decisions, but those of the Marxist body as a whole, <I>not their own</I>, but its tactics. It is a shame and a disgrace that this ABC of Marxism should have to be explained to Duma deputies! What a pass their inclinations towards the liquidators must have brought them to if they dare to act as non-Party people, as subverters of the proletarian political organisation! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The seven pro-liquidators <I>dare not even ask</I> "where is the Marxist organisation?" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And yet, this is the crux of the whole question. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All appeals for unity are sheer hypocrisy if those who make them evade the question of the <I>single</I> will, the <I>single</I> decisions and <I>single</I> tactics of the <I>majority</I> of the advanced and class-conscious workers of Russia organised on a Marxist basis. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 450</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  <I>Za Pravdu</I> long ago indicated the criteria by which the Marxist will of the majority of the workers, opposition to which means splits, disorganisation and disruption can (and must) be judged. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   These criteria are: (1) the elections to the Fourth Duma in the worker curia; (2) the case of the workers' newspapers; (3) the trade unions. In Europe they add to these what is the most important‹the number of openly registered members of political parties. Everybody will understand that data of the latter kind cannot be obtained in Russia; they are partly compensated for by <I>common decisions</I>, which every honest worker regards as binding. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The liquidators and the seven do not say a word about this, not a word about the characteristics of the Marxist organisation, about its decisions and its tactics! The liquidators and the seven want "unity", that is, they want the six workers' deputies <I>to submit to the seven non-Party</I> deputies; that is, <I>they want to flout the will of the Marxist body as a whole.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The liquidators and the seven want the Social-Democratic Duma group to act on its own according to its own sweet will, <I>in isolation from and opposed</I> to this body as a whole. And this disgraceful, disruptive demand they call a demand for unity. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The appeals for unity made by the seven remind one of a well-known quip: the seven want to "unite" with the six in the same way as a man "unites" with a piece of bread. He <I>swallows</I> it.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The seven non-Party men want to swallow the six Marxists; and they demand that this should be called "unity" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The destruction of the Marxist organisation by the seven deputies who have <I>alienated themselves</I> from the majority of the workers, by the seven <I>pro-liquidator</I> deputies, by the seven who have forgotten that in the Duma they are only the <I>vehicles</I> of the will of the majority of the workers‹this is what the liquidators and the seven deputies are aiming at! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The working class protests against this astounding, disruptive behaviour of the arrogant enemies of working-class organisation, and emphatically demands subordination in Duma activities <I>as in all else.</I>
