</CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  1.&nbsp;Does the lecturer acknowledge that the philosophy of Marxism is <I>dialectical materialism </I>? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If he does not, why has he never analysed Engels' countless statements on this subject? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If he does, why do the Machists call their "revision" of dialectical materialism "the philosophy of Marxism"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   2.&nbsp;Does the lecturer acknowledge Engels' fundamental division of philosophical systems into <I>idealism</I> and <I>materialism</I>, Engels regarding those intermediate between these two, wavering between them, as the <I>line</I> of Hume in modern philosophy, calling this line "agnosticism" and declaring Kantianism to be a variety of agnosticism? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   3.&nbsp;Does the lecturer acknowledge that recognition of the external world and its reflection in the human mind form the basis of the theory of knowledge of dialectical materialism? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   4.&nbsp;Does the lecturer acknowledge as correct Engels' argument concerning the conversion of "things-in-themselves" into "things-for-us" ? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   5. Does the lecturer acknowledge as correct Engels' assertion that the "real unity of the world consists in its materiality"? (<I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, 2nd ed.,<A NAME="p1a"> 1886, p. 28, section I, part IV on world schematism.)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en2">2</A>]</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 2</B></FONT><P>
<A NAME="p2">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  6.&nbsp;Does the lecturer acknowledge as correct Engels' assertion that "matter without motion is as inconceivable as motion without matter"? (<I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, 1886, 2nd ed., p. 45, in part 6 on natural philosophy, cosmogony, physics and chemistry.)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en3">3</A>]</FONT> 
<A NAME="p2a">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   7.&nbsp;Does the lecturer acknowledge that the ideas of causality, necessity, law, etc., are a reflection in the human mind of laws of nature, of the real world? Or was Engels wrong in saying so? (<I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, S. 20-21, in part III on apriorism, and S. 103-04, in part XI on freedom and necessity.)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en4">4</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   8.&nbsp;Does the lecturer know that Mach expressed his agreement with the head of the immanentist school, Schuppe, and even dedicated his last and chief philosophical work to him? How does the lecturer explain this adherence of Mach to the obviously idealist philosophy of Schuppe, a defender of <I>clericalism</I> and in general a downright reactionary in philosophy? 
<A NAME="p2b">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   9.&nbsp;Why did the lecturer keep silent about "adventure" with his comrade of yesterday (according to the <I>Studies </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en5">5</A>]</FONT>), the Menshevik Yushkevich, who has today declared Bogdanov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en6">6</A>]</FONT> (following in the wake of Rakhmetov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en7">7</A>]</FONT>) an <I>idealist </I>? Is the lecturer aware that Petzoldt in his latest book has classed a number of Mach's disciples <I>among the idealists </I>? 
<A NAME="p2c">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   10.&nbsp;Does the lecturer confirm the fact that Machism has nothing in common with Bolshevism? And that Lenin has repeatedly protested against Machism?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en8">8</A>]</FONT> And that the Mensheviks Yushkevich and Valentinov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en9">9</A>]</FONT> are "pure" empirio-criticists?

                                     PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  A number of writers, would-be Marxists, have this year undertaken a veritable campaign against the philosophy of Marxism. In the course of less than half a year four books devoted mainly and almost exclusively to attacks on dialectical materialism have made their appearance. These include first and foremost<A NAME="p5"> <I>Studies in</I> [? -- it would have been more proper to say ''against'']<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en11">11</A>]</FONT> <I>the Philosophy of Marxism</I> (St. Petersburg, 1908), a symposium by Bazarov, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Berman, Helfond, Yushkevich and Suvorov; Yushkevich's <I>Materialism and Critical Realism </I>; Berman's <I>Dialectics in the Light of the Modern Theory of Knowledge</I> and Valentinov's <I>The Philosophical Constructions of Marxism</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All these people could not have been ignorant of the fact that Marx and Engels scores of times termed their philosophical views dialectical materialism. Yet all these people, who, despite the sharp divergence of their political views, are united in their hostility towards dialectical materialism, at the same time claim to be Marxists in philosophy! Engels' dialectics is "mysticism," says Berman. Engels' views have become "antiquated," remarks Bazarov casually, as though 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 6</B></FONT><P>

it were a self-evident fact. Materialism thus appears to be refuted by our bold warriors, who proudly allude to the "modern theory of knowledge," "recent philosophy" (or "recent positivism"), the "philosophy of modern natural science," or even the "philosophy of natural science of the twentieth century." Supported by all these supposedly recent doctrines, our destroyers of<A NAME="p6"> dialectical materialism proceed fearlessly to downright fideism<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp6">*</A>]</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en12">12</A>]</FONT> (in the case of Lunacharsky it is most evident, but by no means in his case alone!<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en13">13</A>]</FONT>). Yet when it comes to an explicit definition of their attitude towards Marx and Engels, all their courage and all their respect for their own convictions at once disappear. In deed -- a complete renunciation of dialectical materialism, <I>i.e.</I>, of Marxism; in word -- endless subterfuges, attempts to evade the essence of the question, to cover their retreat, to put some materialist or other in place of materialism in general, and a determined refusal to make a direct analysis of the innumerable materialist declarations of Marx and Engels. This is truly "mutiny on one's knees," as it was justly characterised by one Marxist. This is typical philosophical revisionism, for it was only the revisionists who gained a sad notoriety for themselves by their departure from the fundamental views of Marxism and by their fear, or inability, to "settle accounts" openly, explicitly, resolutely and clearly with the views they had abandoned. When orthodox Marxists had occasion to pronounce against some antiquated views of Marx (for instance, Mehring when he opposed certain historical propositions), it was always done with such precision

</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 7</B></FONT><P>

and thoroughness that no one has ever found anything ambiguous in such literary utterances. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For the rest, there is in the <I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism</I> one phrase which resembles the truth. This is Lunacharsky's phrase: "Perhaps we [<I>i.e.</I>, all the collaborators of the Studies evidently] have gone astray, but we are seeking" (p. 161). That the first half of this phrase contains an absolute and the second a relative truth, I shall endeavour to demonstrate circumstantially in the present book. At the moment I would only remark that if our philosophers had spoken not in the name of Marxism but in the name of a few "seeking" Marxists, they would have shown more respect for themselves and for Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As for myself, I too am a "seeker" in philosophy. Namely, the task I have set myself in these comments is to find out what was the stumbling block to these people who under the guise of Marxism are offering something incredibly muddled, confused and reactionary.

</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  With the exception of a few corrections in the text, the present edition does not differ from the previous one. I hope that, irrespective of the dispute with the Russian "Machians," it will prove useful as an aid to an acquaintance with the philosophy of Marxism, dialectical materialism, as well as with the philosophical conclusions from the recent discoveries in natural science. As for A. A. Bogdanov's latest works, which I have had no opportunity to examine, the appended article<A NAME="p8"> by Comrade V. I. Nevsky gives the necessary information.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en14">14</A>]</FONT> Comrade V.I. Nevsky, not only in his work as a propagandist in general, but also as an active worker in the Party school in particular, has had ample opportunity to convince himself that under the guise of "proletarian culture" A. A. Bogdanov is imparting bourgeois and reactionary views.

</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Anyone in the least acquainted with philosophical literature must know that scarcely a single contemporary professor of philosophy (or of theology) can be found who is not directly or indirectly engaged in refuting materialism. They have declared materialism refuted a thousand times, yet are continuing to refute it for the thousand and first time. All our revisionists are engaged in refuting materialism, pretending, however, that actually they are only refuting the materialist Plekhanov, and not the materialist Engels, nor the materialist Feuerbach, nor the materialist views of J. Dietzgen -- and, moreover, that they are refuting materialism from the standpoint of "recent" and "modern" positivism, natural science, and so forth. Without citing quotations, which anyone desiring to do so could cull by the hundred from the books above mentioned, I shall refer to those arguments by which materialism is being combated by Bazarov, Bogdanov, Yushkevich,

Valentinov, Chernov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp10">*</A>]</FONT> and other Machians. I shall use this latter term throughout as a synonym for "empirio-criticist" because it is shorter and simpler and has already acquired rights of citizenship in Russian literature. That Ernst Mach is the most popular representative of empirio-criticism today is universally acknowledged in philosophical literature,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp10">**</A>]</FONT> while Bogdanov's and Yushkevich's departures from "pure" Machism are of absolutely secondary importance, as will be shown later. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The materialists, we are told, recognise something unthinkable and unknowable -- "things-in-themselves" -- matter "outside of experience" and outside of our knowledge. They lapse into genuine mysticism by admitting the existence of something beyond, something transcending the bounds of "experience" and knowledge. When they say that matter, by acting upon our sense-organs, produces sensations, the materialists take as their basis the "unknown," nothingness; for do they not themselves declare our sensations to be the only source of knowledge? The materialists lapse into "Kantianism" (Plekhanov, by recognising the existence of "things-in-themselves," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., things outside of our consciousness); they "double" the world and preach "dualism," for the materialists hold that beyond the appearance there is the thing-in-itself; beyond the immediate sense data there is something else, some fetish, an "idol," an absolute, a source

of "metaphysics," a double of religion ("holy matter," as Bazarov says). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such are the arguments levelled by the Machians against materialism, as repeated and retold in varying keys by the afore-mentioned writers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In order to test whether these arguments are new, and whether they are really directed against only one Russian materialist who "lapsed into Kantianism," we shall give some detailed quotations from the works of an old idealist, George Berkeley. This historical inquiry is all the more necessary in the introduction to our comments since we shall have frequent occasion to refer to Berkeley and his trend in philosophy, for the Machians misrepresent both the relation of Mach to Berkeley and the essence of Berkeley's philosophical line. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The work of Bishop George Berkeley, published in 1710 under the title <I>Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp11">*</A>]</FONT> begins with the following argument: "It is evident to anyone who takes a survey of the <I>objects</I> of human knowledge, that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the senses; or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind; or lastly, ideas formed by help of memory and imagination. . . . By sight I have the ideas of light and colours, with their several degrees and variations. By touch I perceive hard and soft, heat and cold, motion and resistance. . . . Smelling furnishes me with odours; the palate with tastes; and hearing conveys sounds. . . . And as several of these are observed to accompany each other,

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 12</B></FONT><P>

they come to be marked by one name, and so to be reputed as one thing. Thus, for example, a certain colour, taste, smell, figure and consistence having been observed to go together, are accounted one distinct thing, signified by the name apple; other collections of ideas constitute a stone, a tree, a book, and the like sensible things. . ." (&#167; 1). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such is the content of the first section of Berkeley's work. We must remember that Berkeley takes as the basis of his philosophy "hard, soft, heat, cold, colours, tastes, odours," etc. For Berkeley, things are "collections of ideas," this expression designating the aforesaid, let us say, qualities or sensations, and not abstract thoughts. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Berkeley goes on to say that besides these "ideas or objects of knowledge" there exists something that perceives them -- "mind, spirit, soul or <I>myself </I>" (&#167; 2). It is self-evident, the philosopher concludes, that "ideas" cannot exist outside of the mind that perceives them. In order to convince ourselves of this it is enough to consider the meaning of the word "exist." "The table I write on I say exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I were out of my study I should say it existed; meaning thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it. . . ." That is what Berkeley says in &#167; 3 of his work and thereupon he begins a polemic against the people whom he calls materialists (&#167;&#167; 18, 19, etc.). "For as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things, without any relation to their being perceived," he says, "that is to me perfectly unintelligible." To exist means to be perceived ("Their <I>esse</I> is <I>percipi</I>," &#167; 3 -- a dictum of Berkeley's frequently quoted in textbooks on the history of philosophy). "It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men, that houses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects have an existence, natural or real, distinct from their being 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 13</B></FONT><P>

perceived by the understanding" (&#167; 4). This opinion is a "manifest contradiction," says Berkeley. "For, what are the afore-mentioned objects but the things we perceive by sense? and what do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these, or any combination of them, should exist unperceived?" (&#167; 4). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The expression "collection of ideas" Berkeley now replaces by what to him is an equivalent expression, combination of sensations, and accuses the materialists of a "repugnant" tendency to go still further, of seeking some source of this complex -- that is, of this combination of sensations. In &#167; 5 the materialists are accused of trifling with an abstraction, for to divorce the sensation from the object, according to Berkeley, is an empty abstraction. "In truth," he says at the end of &#167; 5, omitted in the second edition, "the object and the sensation are the same thing, and cannot therefore be abstracted from each other." Berkeley goes on: "But, say you, though the ideas themselves do not exist without the mind, yet there may be things like them, whereof they are copies or resemblances; which things exist without the mind, in an unthinking substance. I answer, an idea can be like nothing but an idea; a colour or figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure. . . . I ask whether those supposed originals, or external things, of which our ideas are the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or not? If they are, then they are ideas and we have gained our point; but if you say they are not, I appeal to anyone whether it be sense to assert a colour is like something which is invisible; hard or soft, like something which is intangible; and so of the rest" (&#167; 8). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As the reader sees, Bazarov's "arguments" against Plekhanov concerning the problem of whether things can exist 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 14</B></FONT><P>

outside of us apart from their action on us do not differ in the least from Berkeley's arguments against the materialists whom he does not mention by name. Berkeley considers the notion of the existence of "matter or corporeal substance" (&#167; 9) such a "contradiction," such an "absurdity" that it is really not worth wasting time exposing it. He says: "But because the tenet of the existence of Matter seems to have taken so deep a root in the minds of philosophers, and draws after it so many ill consequences, I choose rather to be thought prolix and tedious than omit anything that might conduce to the full discovery and extirpation of that prejudice" (&#167; 9). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We shall presently see to what ill consequences Berkeley is referring. Let us first finish with his theoretical arguments against the materialists. Denying the "absolute" existence of objects, that is, the existence of things outside human knowledge, Berkeley bluntly defines the viewpoint of his opponents as bcing that they recognise the "thing-in-itself." In &#167; 24 Berkeley writes in italics that the opinion which he is refuting recognises "<I>the absolute existence of sensible objects in themselves</I>, <I>or without the mind </I>" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 167-68). The two fundamental lines of philosophical outlook are here depicted with the straightforwardness, clarity and precision that distinguish the classical philosophers from the inventors of "new" systems in our day. Materialism is the recognition of "objects in themselves," or outside the mind; ideas and sensations are copies or images of those objects. The opposite doctrine (idealism) claims that objects do not exist "without the mind"; objects are "combinations of sensations." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This was written in 1710, fourteen years before the birth of Immanuel Kant, yet our Machians, supposedly on the basis of "recent" philosophy, have made the discovery that the recognition of "things-in-themselves" is a result of the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 15</B></FONT><P>

infection or distortion of materialism by Kantianism! The "new" discoveries of the Machians are the product of an astounding ignorance of the history of the basic philosophical trends. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Their next "new" thought consists in this: that the concepts "matter" or "substance" are remnants of old uncritical views. Mach and Avenarius, you see, have advanced philosophical thought, deepened analysis and eliminated these "absolutes," "unchangeable entities," etc. If you wish to check such assertions with the original sources, go to Berkeley and you will see that they are pretentious fictions. Berkeley says quite definitely that matter is "nonentity" (&#167; 68), that matter is <I>nothing</I> (&#167; 80). "You may," thus Berkeley ridicules the materialists, "if so it shall seem good, use the word 'matter' in the same sense as other men use 'nothing'" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 196-97). At the beginning, says Berkeley, it was believed that colours, odours, etc., "really exist," but subsequently such views were renounced, and it was seen that they only exist in dependence on our sensations. But this elimination of old erroneous concepts was not completed; a remnant is the concept "substance" (&#167; 73), which is also a "prejudice" (p. 195), and which was finally exposed by Bishop Berkeley in 1710! In 1908 there are still wags who seriously believe Avenarius, Petzoldt, Mach and the rest, when they maintain that it is only "recent positivism" and "recent natural science" which have at last succeeded in eliminating these "metaphysical" conceptions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   These same wags (Bogdanov among them) assure their readers that it was the new philosophy that explained the error of the "duplication of the world" in the doctrine of the eternally refuted materialists, who speak of some sort of a "reflection" by the human consciousness of things existing 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 16</B></FONT><P>

outside the consciousness. A mass of sentimental verbiage has been written by the above-named authors about this "duplication." Owing to forgetfulness or ignorance, they failed to add that these new discoveries had already been discovered in 1710. Berkeley says: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Our knowledge of these [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., ideas or things] has been very much obscured and confounded, and we have been led into very dangerous errors by supposing a twofold existence of the objects of sense -- the one <I>intelligible</I> or in the mind, the other <I>real</I> and without the mind" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., outside consciousness). And Berkeley ridicules this "absurd" notion, which admits the possibility of thinking the unthinkable! The source of the "absurdity," of course, follows from our supposing a difference between "things" and "ideas" (&#167; 87), "the supposition of external objects." This same source -- as discovered by Berkeley in 1710 and rediscovered by Bogdanov in 1908 -- engenders faith in fetishes and idols. "The existence of Matter," says Berkeley, "or bodies unperceived, has not only been the main support of Atheists and Fatalists, but on the same principle doth Idolatry likewise in all its various forms depend" (&#167; 94). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here we arrive at those "ill consequences" derived from the "absurd" doctrine of the existence of an external world which compelled Bishop Berkeley not only to refute this doctrine theoretically, but passionately to persecute its adherents as enemies. "For as we have shown the doctrine of Matter or corporeal Substance to have been the main pillar and support of Scepticism, so likewise upon the same foundation have been raised all the impious schemes of Atheism and Irreligion. . . . How great a friend material substance has been to Atheists in all ages were needless to relate. All their monstrous systems have so visible and necessary a 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 17</B></FONT><P>

dependence on it, that when this cornerstone is once removed, the whole fabric cannot choose but fall to the ground, inso much that it is no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect of Athcists" (&#167; 92, <I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 203-04). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Matter being once expelled out of nature drags with it so many sceptical and impious notions, such an incredible number of disputes and puzzling questions ["the principle of economy of thought," discovered by Mach in the 'seventies, "philosophy as a conception of the world according to the principle of minimum expenditure of effort" -- Avenarius in  1876!] which have been thorns in the sides of divines as well as philosophers, and made so much fruitless work for mankind, that if the arguments we have produced against it are not found equal to demonstration (as to me they evidently seem), yet I am sure all friends to knowledge, peace, and religion have reason to wish they were" (&#167; 96). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Frankly and bluntly did Bishop Berkeley argue! In our time these very same thoughts on the "economical" elimination of "matter" from philosophy are enveloped in a much more artful form, and confused by the use of a "new" terminology, so that these thoughts may be taken by na&iumlve people for "recent" philosophy! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But Berkeley was not only candid as to the tendencies of his philosophy, he also endeavoured to cover its idealistic nakedness, to represent it as being free from absurdities and acceptable to "common sense." Instinctively defending himself against the accusation of what would nowadays be called subjective idealism and solipsism, he says that by our philosophy "we are not deprived of any one thing in nature" (&#167; 34). Nature remains, and the distinction between realities and chimeras remains, only "they both equally exist in the mind." 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 18</B></FONT><P>

"I do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflection. That the things I see with my eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question. The only thing whose existence we deny is that which <I>philosophers</I> [Berkeley's italics] call Matter or corporeal substance. And in doing this there is no damage done to the rest of mankind, who, I dare say, will never miss it. . . . The Atheist indeed will want the colour of an empty name to support his impiety. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This thought is made still clearer in &#167; 37, where Berkeley replies to the charge that his philosophy destroys corporeal substance: ". . . if the word <I>substance</I> be taken in the vulgar sense, for a <I>combination</I> of sensible qualities, such as extension, solidity, weight, and the like -- this we cannot be accused of taking away; but if it be taken in a philosophic sense, for the support of accidents or qualities without the mind -- then indeed I acknowledge that we take it away, if one may be said to take away that which never had any existence, not even in the imagination." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Not without good cause did the English philosopher, Fraser, an idealist and adherent of Berkeleianism, who published Berkeley's works and supplied them with his own annotations designate Berkeley's doctrine by the term "natural realism" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. x). This amusing terminology must by all means be noted, for it in fact expresses Berkeley's intention to counterfeit realism. In our further exposition we shall frequently find "recent" "positivists" repeating the same stratagem or counterfeit in a different form and in a different verbal wrapping. Berkeley does not deny the existence of real things! Berkeley does not go counter to the opinion of all humanity! Berkeley denies "only" the teaching of the philosophers, <I>viz</I>., the theory of knowledge, which seriously and resolutely takes 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 19</B></FONT><P>

as the foundation of all its reasoning the recognition of the external world and the reflection thereof in the minds of men. Berkeley does not deny natural science, which has always adhered (mostly unconsciously) to this, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the materialist, theory of knowledge. We read in &#167; 59: "We may, from the experience [Berkeley -- a philosophy of 'pure experience']<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp19">*</A>]</FONT> we have had of the train and succession of ideas in our minds . . . make . . . well-grounded predictions concerning the ideas we shall be affected with pursuant to a great train of actions, and be enabled to pass a right judgment of what would have appeared to us, in case we were placed in circumstances very different from those we are in at present. Herein consists the knowledge of nature, which [listen to this!] may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what hath been said." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Let us regard the external world, nature, as "a combination of sensations" evoked in our mind by a deity. Acknowledge this and give up searching for the "ground" of these sensations outside the mind, outside man, and I will acknowledge within the framework of my idealist theory of knowledge <I>all</I> natural science and all the use and certainty of its deductions. It is precisely this framework, and only this framework, that I need for my deductions in favour of "peace and religion." Such is Berkeley's train of thought. It correctly expresses the essence of idealist philosophy and its social significance, and we shall encounter it later when we come to speak of the relation of Machism to natural science. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Let us now consider another recent discovery that was borrowed from Bishop Berkeley in the twentieth century by 

<A NAME="fnp19">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
* In his preface Fraser insists that both Berkeley and Locke "appeal exclusively to experience" (p. 117). 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 20</B></FONT><P>

the recent positivist and critical realist, P. Yushkevich. This discovery is "empirio-symbolism." "Berkeley," says Fraser "thus reverts to his favourite theory of a Universal Naturai Symbolism" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 190). Did these words not occur in an edition of 1871, one might have suspected the English fideist philosopher Fraser of plagiarising both the modern mathematician and physicist Poincare and the Russian "Marxist" Yushkevich! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This theory of Berkeley's, which threw Fraser into raptures, is set forth by the Bishop as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The connexion of ideas [do not forget that for Berkeley ideas and things are identical] does not imply the relation of <I>cause</I> and <I>effect</I>, but only of a mark or <I>sign</I> with the thing <I>signified </I>" (&#167; 65). "Hence, it is evident that those things, which under the notion of a cause co-operating or concurring to the production of effects, are altogether inexplicable, and run us into great absurdities, may be very naturally explained . . . when they are considered only as marks or signs for our information" (&#167; 66). Of course, in the opinion of Berkeley and Fraser, it is no other than the deity who informs us by means of these "empirio-symbols." The epistemological significance of <I>symbolism</I> in Berkeley's theory, however, consists in this, that it is to replace "the doctrine" which "pretends to explain things by corporeal causes" (&#167; 66). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have before us two philosophical trends in the question of causality. One "pretends to explain things by corporeal causes." It is clear that it is connected with the "doctrine of matter" refuted as an "absurdity" by Bishop Berkeley. The other reduces the "notion of cause" to the notion of a "mark or sign" which serves for "our information" (supplied by God). We shall meet these two trends in a twentieth-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 21</B></FONT><P>

century garb when we analyse the attitudes of Machism and dialectical materialism to this question. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Further, as regards the question of reality, it ought also to be remarked that Berkeley, refusing as he does to recognise the existence of things outside the mind, tries to find a criterion for distinguishing between the real and the fictitious. In &#167; 36 he says that those "ideas" which the minds of men evoke at pleasure "are faint, weak, and unsteady in respect to others they perceive by sense; which, being impressed upon them according to certain rules or laws of nature, speak themselves about the effects of a Mind more powerful and wise than human spirits. These latter are said to have <I>more reality</I> in them than the former; by which is meant that they are more affecting, orderly and distinct, and that they are not fictions of the mind perceiving them. . . ." Elsewhere (&#167; 84) Berkeley tries to connect the notion of reality with the simultaneous perception of the same sensations by many people. For instance, how shall we resolve the question as to whether the transformation of water into wine, of which we are being told, is real? "If at table all who were present should see, and smell, and taste, and drink wine, and find the effects of it, with me there could be no doubt of its reality." And Fraser explains: "Simultaneous perception of the 'same'. . . <I>sense</I>-ideas, by different persons, as distinguished from purely individual consciousness of feelings and <I>fancies</I>, is here taken as a test of the . . . <I>reality</I> of the former." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From this it is evident that Berkeley's subjective idealism is not to be interpreted as though it ignored the distinction between individual and collective perception. On the contrary, he attempts on the basis of this distinction to construct a criterion of reality. Deriving "ideas" from the action 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 22</B></FONT><P>

of a deity upon the human mind, Berkeley thus approaches objective idealism: the world proves to be not my idea but the product of a single supreme spiritual cause that creates both the "laws of nature" and the laws distinguishing "more real" ideas from less real, and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In another work, <I>The Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous</I> (1713), where he endeavours to present his views in an especially popular form, Berkeley sets forth the opposition between his doctrine and the materialist doctrine in the following way: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "I assert as well as you [materialists] that, since we are affected from without, we must allow Powers to be without, in a Being distinct from ourselves. . . . But then we differ as to the kind of this powerful being. I will have it to be Spirit, you Matter, or I know not what (I may add too, you know not what) third nature. . ." (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 335). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is the gist of the whole question; Fraser comments: according to the materialists, sensible phenomena are due to <I>material substance</I>, or to some unknown "third nature"; according to Berkeley, to rational Will; according to Hume and the Positivists, their origin is absolutely unknown, and we can only generalise them inductively, through custom, as facts. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here the English Berkeleian, Fraser, approaches from his consistent idealist standpoint the same fundamental "lines" in philosophy which were so clearly characterised by the materialist Engels. In his work <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I> Engels divides philosophers into "two great camps" -- materialists and idealists. Engels -- dealing with theories of the two trends much more developed, varied and rich in content than Fraser dealt with -- sees the fundamental distinction between them in the fact that while for the materialists nature is 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 23</B></FONT><P>

primary and spirit secondary, for the idealists the reverse is the case. In between these two camps Engels places the adherents of Hume and Kant, who deny the possibility of knowing the world, or at least of knowing it fully,<A NAME="p23"> and calls them agnostics<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en15">15</A>]</FONT>. In his Ludwig Feuerbach Engels applies this term only to the adherents of Hume (those people whom Fraser calls, and who like to call themselves, "positivists"). But in his article<A NAME="p23a"> "On Historical Materialism," Engels explicitly speaks of the standpoint of "the Neo-Kantian agnostic,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en16">16</A>]</FONT> regarding Neo-Kantianism as a variety of agnosticism.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp23">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    We cannot dwell here on this remarkably correct and profound judgment of Engels' (a judgment which is shamelessly ignored by the Machians). We shall discuss it in detail later on. For the present we shall confine ourselves to pointing to this Marxist terminology and to this meeting of extremes: the views of a consistent materialist and of a consistent idealist on the fundamental philosophical trends. In order to illustrate these trends (with which we shall constantly have to deal in our further exposition) let us briefly note the views of outstanding philosophers of the eighteenth century who pursued a different path from Berkeley. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Here are Hume's arguments. In his <I>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</I>, in the chapter (XII) on sceptical philosophy, he says: "It seems evident, that men are carried, by a natural instinct or prepossession, to repose faith in their senses; and that, without any reasoning, or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an external universe, which depends not on our perception, but would

exist though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated. Even the animal creations are governed by a like opinion, and preserve this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts, designs, and actions. . . . But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are only the inlets, through which these images are conveyed, without being able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object. The table, which we see, seems to diminish, as we remove farther from it: But the real table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration: It was, therefore, nothing but its image, which was present to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of reason; and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that the existences, which we consider, when we say, 'this house,' and 'that tree' are nothing but perceptions in the mind. . . . By what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind must be caused by external objects, entirely different from them, though resembling them (if that be possible), and could not arise either from the energy of the mind itself, or from the suggestion of some invisible and unknown spirit, or from some other cause still more unknown to us? . . . How shall the question be determined? By experience surely; as all other questions of a like nature. But here experience is, and must be entirely silent. The mind has never anything present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any experience of their connection with objects. This supposition of such a connection is, therefore, without any foundation in reasoning. To have recourse to the veracity of the Supreme Being, in order to prove the veracity of our senses, is surely making a very unexpected circuit . . . if the external

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    He says the same thing in his <I>Treatise of Humtm Nature</I> (Part IV, Sec. II, "On Scepticism Towards Sensations"): "Our perceptions are our only objects." (P. 281 of the French translation by Renouvier and Pillon, 1878.) By scepticism Hume means refusal to explain sensations as the effects of objects, spirit, etc., refusal to reduce perceptions to the external world, on the one hand, and to a deity or to an unknown spirit, on the other. And the author of the introduction to the French translation of Hume, F. Pillon -- a philosopher of a trend akin to Mach (as we shall see below) -- justly remarks that for Hume subject and object are reduced to "groups of various perceptions," to "elements of consciousness, to impressions, ideas, etc."; that the only concern should be with the "groupings and combinations of these elements."** The English Humean, Huxley, who coined the apt and correct term "agnosticism," in his book on Hume also emphasises the fact that the latter, regarding "sensations" as the "primary and irreducible states of consciousness," is not entirely consistent on the question how the origin of sensations is to be explained, whether by the effect of objects on man or by the creative power of the mind. "Realism and idealism are equally probable hypotheses" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., for Hume).*** Hume does not go

beyond sensations. "Thus the colours red and blue, and the odour of a rose, are simple impressions. . . . A red rose gives us a complex impression, capable of resolution into the simple impressions of red colour, rose-scent, and numerous others" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 64-65). Hume admits both the "materialist position" and the "idealist position" (p. 82); the "collection of perceptions" may be generated by the Fichtean "ego" or may be a "signification" and even a "symbol" of a "real something." This is how Huxley interprets Hume. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    As for the materialists, here is an opinion of Berkeley given by Diderot, the leader of the Encyclopaedists: "Those philosophers are called <I>idealists</I> who, being conscious only of their existence and of the sensations which succeed each other within themselves, do not admit anything else. An extravagant system which, to my thinking, only the blind could have originated; a system which, to the shame of human intelligence and philosophy, is the most difficult to combat, although the most absurd of all."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp26">*</A>]</FONT> And Diderot, who came very close to the standpoint of contemporary materialism (that arguments and syllogisms alone do not suffice to refute idealism, and that here it is not a question for theoretical argument), notes the similarity of the premises both of the idealist Berkeley, and the sensationalist Condillac. In his opinion, Condillac should have undertaken a refutation of Berkeley in order to avoid such absurd conclusions being drawn from the treatment of sensations as the only source of our knowledge. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In the "Conversation Between d'Alembert and Diderot," Diderot states his philosophical position thus: " . . . Suppose

a piano to be endowed with the faculty of sensation and memory, tell me, would it not of its own accord repeat those airs which you have played on its keys? We are instruments endowed with sensation and memory. Our senses are so many keys upon which surrounding nature strikes and which often strike upon themselves. And this is all, in my opinion, that occurs in a piano organised like you and me." D'Alembert retorts that such an instrument would have to possess the faculty of finding food for itself and of reproducing little pianos. Undoubtedly, contends Diderot. -- But take an egg. "This is what refutes all the schools of theology and all the temples on earth. What is this egg? A mass that is insensible until the embryo is introduced thither, and when this embryo is introduced, what is it then? An insensible mass, for in its turn, this embryo is only an inert and crude liquid. How does this mass arrive at a different organisation, arrive at sensibility and life? By means of heat. And what produces heat? Motion. . . ." The animal that is hatched from the egg is endowed with all your sensations; it performs all your actions. "Would you maintain with Descartes that this is a simple imitating machine? Little children will laugh at you, and the philosophers will reply that if this be a machine then you too are a machine. If you admit that the difference between these animals and you is only one of organisation, you will prove your common sense and sagacity, you will be right. But from this will follow the conclusion that refutes you; namely, that from inert matter organised in a certain way, impregnated with another bit of inert matter, by heat and motion -- sensibility, life, memory, consciousness, emotion, and thought are generated." One of the two, continues Diderot, either admit some "hidden element" in the egg, that penetrates to it in an unknown way at a certain stage 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 28</B></FONT><P>

of development, an element about which it is unknown whether it occupies space, whether it is material or whether it is created for the purpose -- which is contradictory to common sense, and leads to inconsistencies and absurdities; or we must make "a simple supposition which explains everything, namely, that the faculty of sensation is a general property of matter, or a product of its organisation." To d'Alembert's objection that such a supposition implies a quality which in its essence is incompatible with matter, Diderot retorts:
   "And how do you know that the faculty of sensation is essentially incompatible with matter, since you do not know the essence of any thing at all, either of matter, or of sensation? Do you understand the nature of motion any better, its existence in a body, its communication from one body to another?" D'Alembert: "Without knowing the nature of sensation, or that of matter, I see, however, that the faculty of sensation is a simple quality, single, indivisible, and incompatible with a divisible subject or substratum (<I>supp&ocirct </I>)." Diderot: "Metaphysico-theological nonsense! What, do you not see that all qualities of matter, that all its forms accessible to our senses are in their essence indivisible? There cannot be a larger or a smaller degree of impenetrability. There may be half of a round body, but there is no half of roundness. . . . Be a physicist and admit the derivative character of the given effect when you see how it is derived, though you may be unable to explain the relation between the cause and the effect. Be logical and do not replace a cause that exists and explains everything by some other cause which it is impossible to conceive, and the connection of which with the effect is even more difficult to conceive, and which engenders an infinite number of difficulties without solving a single one of them." D'Alembert: "And what if I abandon 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 29</B></FONT><P>

this cause?" Diderot: "There is only one substance in the universe, in men and in animals. A hand-organ is of wood, man of flesh. A finch is of flesh, and a musician is of flesh, but differently organised; but both are of the same origin, of the same formation, have the same functions and the same purpose." D'Alembert: "And what establishes the similarity of sounds between your two pianos?" Diderot: " . . . The instrument endowed with the faculty of sensation, or the animal, has learned by experience that after a certain sound certain consequences follow outside of it; that other sentient instruments, like itself, or similar animals, approach, recede, demand, offer, wound, caress; -- and all these consequences are associated in its memory and in the memory of other animals with the formation of sounds. Mark, in intercourse between people there is nothing beside sounds and actions. And to appreciate all the power of my system, mark again that it is faced with that same insurmountable difficulty which Berkeley adduced against the existence of bodies. There was a moment of insanity when the sentient piano imagined that it was the only piano in the world, and that the whole harmony of the universe resided within it."* 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This was written in 1769. And with this we shall conclude our brief historical enquiry. We shall have more than one occasion to meet "the insane piano" and the harmony of the universe residing within man when we come to analyse "recent positivism." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For the present we shall confine ourselves to one conclusion: the "recent" Machians have not adduced a single argument against the materialists that had not been adduced by Bishop Berkeley.

  Let us mention as a curiosity that one of these Machians, Valentinov, vaguely sensing the falsity of his position, has tried to "cover up the traces" of his kinship with Berkeley and has done so in a rather amusing manner. On page 150 of his book we read: " . . . When those who, speaking of Mach, point to Berkeley, we ask, which Berkeley do they mean? Do they mean the Berkeley who traditionally regards himself [Valentinov wishes to say who is regarded] as a solipsist; the Berkeley who defends the immediate presence and providence of the deity? Generally speaking [?], do they mean Berkeley, the philosophising bishop, the destroyer of atheism, or Berkeley, the thoughtful analyser? With Berkeley the solipsist and preacher of religious metaphysics Mach indeed has nothing in common." Valentinov is muddled; he was unable to make clear to himself why he was obliged to defend Berkeley the "thoughtful analyser" and idealist against the materialist Diderot. Diderot drew a clear distinction between the fundamental philosophical trends. Valentinov confuses them, and while doing so very amusingly tries to console us: "We would not consider the 'kinship' of Mach to the idealist views of Berkeley a philosophical crime," he says, "even if this actually were the case" (p. 149). To confound two irreconcilable fundamental trends in philosophy -- really, what "crime" is that? But that is what the whole wisdom of Mach and Avenarius amounts to. We shall now proceed to an examination of this wisdom.

  The fundamental premises of the theory of knowledge of Mach and Avenarius are frankly, simply and clearly expounded by them in their early philosophical works. To these works we shall now turn, postponing for later treatment an examination of the corrections and emendations subsequently made by these writers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The task of science," Mach wrote in 1872, "can only be: 1. To determine the laws of connection of ideas (Psychology). 2. To discover the laws of connection of sensations (Physics). 3. To explain the laws of connection between sensations and ideas (Psycho-physics)."* This is quite clear.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The subject matter of physics is the connection between sensations and not between things or bodies, of which our sensations are the image. And in 1883, in his <I>Mechanik</I>, Mach repeats the same thought: "Sensations are not 'symbols of things.' The 'thing' is rather a mental symbol for a complex of sensations of relative stability. Not the things (bodies) but colours, sounds, pressures, spaces, times (what we usually call sensations) are the real <I>elements</I> of the world."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp32">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    About this word "elements," the fruit of twelve years of "reflection," we shall speak later. At present let us note that Mach explicitly states here that things or bodies are complexes of sensations, and that he quite clearly sets up his own philosophical point of view against the opposite theory which holds that sensations are "symbols" of things (it would be more correct to say images or reflections of things). The latter theory is <I>philosophical materialism</I>. For instance, the materialist Frederick Engels -- the not unknown collaborator of Marx and a founder of Marxism -- constantly and without exception speaks in his works of things and their mental pictures or images (<I>Gedanken-Abbilder </I>), and it is obvious that these mental images arise exclusively from sensations. It would seem that this fundamental standpoint of the "philosophy of Marxism" ought to be known to everyone who speaks of it, and especially to anyone who comes out in print <I>in the name</I> of this philosophy. But because of the extraordinary confusion which our Machians have introduced, it becomes necessary to repeat what is generally known. We

No . . . these forms can never be created and derived by thought out of itself, but only from the external world . . . the principles are not the starting point of the investigation [as D&uumlhring who would be a materialist, but cannot consistently adhere to materialism, holds], but its final result; they are not applied to nature and human history, but abstracted from them; it is not nature and the realm of humanity which conform to these principles, but the principles are only valid in so far as they are in conformity with nature and history.

that formulation of materialism, but of the opposition of materialism to idealism, of the difference between the two fundamental <I>lines</I> in philosophy. Are we to proceed from things to sensation and thought? Or are we to proceed from thought and sensation to things? The first line, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the materialist line, is adopted by Engels. The second line, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the idealist line, is adopted by Mach. No evasions, no sophisms (a multitude of which we shall yet encounter) can remove the clear and indisputable fact that Ernst Mach's doctrine that things are complexes of sensations is subjective idealism and a simple rehash of Berkeleianism. If bodies are "complexes of sensations," as Mach says, or "combinations of sensations," as Berkeley said, it inevitably follows that the whole world is but my idea. Starting from such a premise it is impossible to arrive at the existence of other people besides oneself: it is the purest solipsism. Much as Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt and the others may abjure solipsism, they cannot in fact escape solipsism without falling into howling logical absurdities. To make this fundamental element of the philosophy of Machism still clearer, we shall give a few additional quotations from Mach's works. Here is a sample from the <I>Analyse der Empfindungen</I> (<I>Analysis of Sensations </I>; I quote from Kotlyar's Russian translation, published by Skirmunt, Moscow, 1907): 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "We see a body with a point S. If we touch S, that is, bring it into contact with our body, we receive a prick. We can see S without feeling the prick. But as soon as we feel the prick we find S on the skin. Thus, the visible point is a permanent nucleus, to which, according to circumstances, the prick is attached as something accidental. By frequent repetitions of analogous occurrences we finally habituate ourselves to regard all properties of bodies as 'effects' which 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 35</B></FONT><P>

proceed from permanent nuclei and are conveyed to <I>the self</I> through the medium of the body; which effects we call <I>sensations</I> . . ." (p. 20). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In other words, people "habituate" themselves to adopt the standpoint of materialism, to regard sensations as the result of the action of bodies, things, nature on our sense organs. This "habit," so noxious to the philosophical idealists (a habit acquired by all mankind and all natural science!), is not at all to the liking of Mach, and he proceeds to destroy it: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . Thereby, however, these nuclei are deprived of their entire sensible content and are converted into naked abstract symbols . . . . " 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   An old song, most worthy Professor! This is a literal repetition of Berkeley who said that matter is a naked abstract symbol. But it is Ernst Mach, in fact, who goes naked, for if he does not admit that the "sensible content" is an objective reality, existing independently of us, there remains only a "naked abstract" <I>I</I>, an <I>I</I> infallibly written with a capital letter and italicised, equal to "the insane piano, which imagined that it was the sole existing thing in this world." If the "sensible content" of our sensations is not the external world then nothing exists save this naked <I>I</I> engaged in empty "philosophical" acrobatics. A stupid and fruitless occupation! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . It is then correct that the world consists <I>only</I> of our sensations. In which case we have knowledge only of sensations, and the assumption of those nuclei, and of their interaction, from which alone sensations proceed, turns out to be quite idle and superfluous. Such a view can only appeal to <I>half-hearted</I> realism or <I>half-hearted</I> criticism." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have quoted the sixth paragraph of Mach's "anti-metaphysical observations" in full. It is a sheer plagiarism 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 36</B></FONT><P>

on Berkeley. Not a single idea, not a glimmer of thought, except that "we sense only our sensations." From which there is only one possible inference, namely, that the "world consists only of <I>my</I> sensations." The word "our" employed by Mach instead of "my" is employed illegitimately. By this word alone Mach betrays that "half-heartedness" of which he accuses others. For if the "assumption" of the existence of the external world is "idle," if the assumption that the needle exists independently of me and that an interaction takes place between my body and the point of the needle is really "idle and superfluous," then primarily the "assumption" of the existence of other people is idle and superfluous. Only I exist, and all other people, as well as the external world, come under the category of idle "nuclei." Holding this point of view one cannot speak of "<I>our </I>" sensations; and when Mach does speak of them, it is only a betrayal of his own amazing half-heartedness. It only proves that his philosophy is a jumble of idle and empty words in which their author himself does not believe. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is a particularly graphic example of Mach's half heartedness and confusion. In &#167; 6 of Chapter XI of the <I>Analysis of Sensations</I> we read: "If I imagine that while I am experiencing sensations, I or someone else could observe my brain with all possible physical and chemical appliances, it would be possible to ascertain with what processes of the organism particular sensations are connected . . . " (p. 197). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Very well! This means, then, that our sensations are connected with definite processes, which take place in the organism in general, and in our brain in particular? Yes, Mach very definitely makes this "assumption" -- it would be quite a task not to make it from the standpoint of natural science! But is not this the very "assumption" of those very 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 37</B></FONT><P>

same "nuclei and their interaction" which our philosopher declared to be idle and superfluous? We are told that bodies are complexes of sensations; to go beyond that, Mach assures us, to regard sensations as a product of the action of bodies upon our sense-organs, is metaphysics, an idle and superfluous assumption, etc., <I>&agrave la</I> Berkeley. But the brain is a body. Consequently, the brain also is no more than a complex of sensations. It follows, then, that with the help of a complex of sensations I (and <I>I</I> also am nothing but a complex of sensations) sense complexes of sensations. A delightful philosophy! First sensations are declared to be "the real elements of the world"; on this an "original" Berkeleianism is erected -- and then the very opposite view is smuggled in, <I>viz</I>., that sensations are connected with definite processes in the organism. Are not these "processes" connected with an exchange of matter between the "organism" and the external world? Could this exchange of matter take place if the sensations of the particular organism did not give it an objectively correct idea of this external world? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Mach does not ask himself such embarrassing questions when he mechanically jumbles fragments of Berkeleianism with the views of natural science, which instinctively adheres to the materialist theory of knowledge. . . . In the same paragraph Mach writes: "It is sometimes also asked whether (inorganic) 'matter' experiences sensation. . . . " Does this mean that there is no doubt that <I>organic</I> matter experiences sensation? Does this mean that sensation is not something primary but that it is one of the properties of matter? Mach skips over all the absurdities of Berkeleianism! . . . "The question," he avers, "is natural enough, if we proceed from the current widespread physical notions, according to which matter is the <I>immediate</I> and indisputably given <I>reality</I>, out of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 38</B></FONT><P>

which everything, inorganic and organic, is constructed. . . . " Let us bear in mind this truly valuable admission of Mach's that the current widespread <I>physical</I> notions regard matter as the immediate reality, and that only one variety of this reality (organic matter) possesses the well-defined property of sensation. . . . Mach continues: "Then, indeed, sensation must suddenly arise somewhere in this structure consisting of matter, or else have previously been present in the foundation. From <I>our</I> standpoint the quesion is a false one. For us matter is not what is primarily given. Rather, what is primarily given are the <I>elements</I> (which in a certain familiar relation are designated as sensations). . . . " 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What is primarily given, then, are sensations, although they are "connected" only with definite processes in organic matter! And while uttering such absurdities Mach wants to blame materialism ("the current widespread physical notion") for leaving unanswered the question whence sensation "arises." This is a sample of the "refutation" of materialism by the fideists and their hangers-on. Does any other philosophical standpoint "solve" a problem before enough data for its solution has been collected? Does not Mach himself say in the very same paragraph: "So long as this problem (how far sensation extends in the organic world) has not been solved even in a single special case, no answer to the question is possible." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The difference between materialism and "Machism" in this particular question thus consists in the following. Materialism, in full agreement with natural science, takes matter as primary and regards consciousness, thought, sensation as secondary, because in its well-defined form sensation is associated only with the higher forms of matter (organic matter), while "in the foundation of the structure of matter" one can 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 39</B></FONT><P>

only surmise the existence of a faculty akin to sensation. Such, for example, is the supposition of the well-known German scientist Ernst Haeckel, the English biologist Lloyd Morgan and others, not to speak of Diderot's conjecture mentioned above. Machism holds to the opposite, the idealist point of view, and at once lands into an absurdity: since, in the first place, sensation is taken as primary, in spite of the fact that it is associated only with definite processes in matter organised in a definite way; and since, in the second place, the basic premise that bodies are complexes of sensations is violated by the assumption of the existence of other living beings and, in general, of other "complexes" besides the given great <I>I</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The word "element," which many na&iumlve people (as we shall see) take to be some sort of a new discovery, in reality only obscures the question, for it is a meaningless term which creates the false impression that a solution or a step forward has been achieved. This impression is a false one, because there still remains to be investigated and reinvestigated how matter, apparently entirely devoid of sensation, is related to matter which, though composed of the same atoms (or electrons), is yet endowed with a well-defined faculty of sensation. Materialism clearly formulates the as yet unsolved problem and thereby stimulates the attempt to solve it, to undertake further experimental investigation. Machism, which is a species of muddled idealism, befogs the issue and side tracks it by means of the futile verbal trick, "element." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is a passage from Mach's latest, comprehensive and conclusive philosophical work that clearly betrays the falsity of this idealist trick. In his <I>Knowledge and Error</I> we read: "While there is no difficulty in constructing (<I>aufzubauen </I>) <I>every physical</I> experience out of sensations, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., <I>psychical</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 40</B></FONT><P>

elements, it is impossible to imagine (<I>ist keine M&oumlglichkeit abzusehen </I>) how any <I>psychical</I> experience can be composed (<I>darstellen </I>) of the elements employed in modern physics, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., mass and motion (in their rigidity -- <I>Starrheit</I> -- which is serviceable only for this special science)."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp40">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Of the rigidity of the conceptions of many modern scientists and of their metaphysical (in the Marxist sense of the term, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., anti-dialectical) views, Engels speaks repeatedly and very precisely. We shall see later that it was just on this point that Mach went astray, because he did not understand or did not know the relation between relativism and dialectics. But this is not what concerns us here. It is important for us here to note how glaringly Mach's <I>idealism</I> emerges, in spite of the confused -- ostensibly new -- terminology. There is no difficulty, you see, in constructing any physical element out of sensations, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., psychical elements! Oh yes, such constructions, of course, are not difficult, for they are purely verbal constructions, shallow scholasticism, serving as a loophole for fideism. It is not surprising after this that Mach dedicates his works to the immanentists; it is not surprising that the immanentists, who profess the most reactionary kind of philosophical idealism, welcome Mach with open arms. The "recent positivism" of Ernst Mach was only about two hundred years too late. Berkeley had already sufficiently shown that "out of sensations, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., psychical elements," nothing can be "built" except <I>solipsism</I>. As regards materialism, against which Mach here, too, sets up his own views, without frankly and explicitly naming the "enemy," we have already seen in the case of Diderot what the real views of the materialists are. These views do not consist in deriving sensation

from the movement of matter or in reducing sensation to the movement of matter, but in recognising sensation as one of the properties of matter in motion. On this question Engels shared the standpoint of Diderot. Engels dissociated himself from the "vulgar" materialists, Vogt, B&uumlchner and Moleschott, for the very reason, among others, that they erred in believing that the brain secretes thought <I>in the same way</I> as the liver secretes bile. But Mach, who constantly sets up his views in opposition to materialism, ignores, of course, all the great materialists -- Diderot, Feuerbach, Marx and Engels -- just as all other official professors of official philosophy do. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In order to characterise Avenarius' earliest and basic view, let us take his first independent philosophical work, <I>Philosophy as a Conception of the World According to the Principle of the Minimum Expenditure of Effort</I>. <I>Prolegomena to a Critique of Pure Experience</I>, which appeared in 1876. Bogdanov in his <I>Empirio-Monism</I> (Bk. I, 2nd ed., 1905, p. 9, note) says that "in the development of Mach's views, the starting point was philosophical idealism, while a realistic tinge was characteristic of Avenarius from the very beginning." Bogdanov said so because he believed what Mach said (see <I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, Russian translation, p. 288). Bogdanov should not have believed Mach, and his assertion is diametrically opposed to the truth. On the contrary, Avenarius' idealism emerges so clearly in his work of 1876 that Avenarius himself in 1891 was obliged to admit it. In the introduction to <I>The Human Concept of the World</I> Avenarius says: "He who has read my first systematic work, <I>Philosophie</I>, <I>etc</I>., will at once have presumed that I would have attempted to treat the problems of a criticism of pure experience from the 'idealist' standpoint" (<I>Der menschliche Welt-</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 42</B></FONT><P>

<I>begriff</I>, 1891, Vorwort, S. ix [<I>The Human Concept of the World</I>, 1891, Foreword, p. ix]), but "the sterility of philosophical idealism compelled me to doubt the correctness of my previous path" (p. x). This idealist starting point of Avenarius' is universally acknowledged in philosophical literature. Of the French writers I shall refer to Cauwelaert, who says that <A NAME="p42">Avenarius' philosophical standpoint in the <I>Prolegomena </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en19">19</A>]</FONT> is "monistic idealism."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp42">*</A>]</FONT> Of the German writers, I shall name Rudolf Willy, Avenarius' disciple, who says that "Avenarius in his youth -- and particularly in his work of 1876 -- was totally under the spell (<I>ganz itn Banne </I>) of so-called epistemological idealism."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp42">**</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And, indeed, it would be ridiculous to deny the idealism in Avenarius' <I>Prolegomena</I>, where he explicitly states that "<I>only sensation can be thought of as the existing </I>" (pp. 10 and 65 of the second German edition; all italics in quotations are ours). This is how Avenarius himself presents the contents of &#167; 116 of his work. Here is the paragraph in full: "We have recognised that the existing (<I>das Seiende </I>) is substance endowed with sensation; the substance falls away [it is "more economical," don't you see, there is "a lesser expenditure of effort" in thinking that there is no "substance" and that no external world exists!], sensation remains; we must then regard the existing as sensation, at the basis of which there is nothing which does not possess sensation (<I>nichts Empfindungsloses </I>)."

  Sensation, then, exists without "substance," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., thought exists without brain! Are there really philosophers capable of defending this brainless philosophy? There are! Professor Richard Avenarius is one of them. And we must pause for a while to consider this defence, difficult though it be for a normal person to take it seriously. Here, in &#167;&#167; 89 and 90 of this same work, is Avenarius' argument: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . The proposition that motion produces sensation is based on apparent experience only. This experience, which includes the act of perception, consists, presumably, in the fact that sensation is generated in a certain kind of substance (brain) as a result of transmitted motion (excitation) and with the help of other material conditions (<I>e</I>.<I>g</I>., blood). However -- apart from the fact that such generation has never itself (<I>selbst </I>) been observed -- in order to construct the supposed experience, as an experience which is real in all its component parts, empirical proof, at least, is required to show that sensation, which assumedly is caused in a certain substance by transmitted motion, did not already exist in that substance in one way or another; so that the appearance of sensation cannot be conceived of in any other way than as a creative act on the part of the transmitted motion. Thus only by proving that where a sensation now appears there was none previously, not even a minimal one, would it be possible to establish a fact which, denoting as it does some act of creation, contradicts all the rest of experience and radically changes all the rest of our conception of nature (<I>Naturanschauung </I>). But such proof is not furnished by any experience, and cannot be furnished by any experience; on the contrary, the notion of a state of a substance totally devoid of sensation which subsequently begins to experience sensation is only a hypothesis. But this hypothesis merely complicates and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 44</B></FONT><P>

obscures our understanding instead of simplifying and clarifying it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Should the so-called experience, <I>viz</I>., that the sensation is <I>caused</I> by a transmitted motion in a substance that begins to perceive from this moment, prove upon closer examination to be only apparent, there still remains sufficient material in the content of the experience to ascertain at least the relative origin of sensation from conditions of motion, namely, to ascertain that the sensation which is present, although latent or minimal, or for some other reason not manifest to the consciousness, becomes, owing to transmitted motion, released or enhanced or made manifest to the consciousness. However, even this bit of the remaining content of experience is only an appearance. Were we even by an ideal observation to trace the motion proceeding from the moving substance A, transmitted through a series of intermediate centres and reaching the substance B, which is endowed with sensation, we should at best find that sensation in substance B is developed or becomes enhanced simultaneously with the reception of the incoming motion -- but we should not find that this occurred as a <I>consequence</I> of the motion. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have purposely quoted this refutation of materialism by Avenarius in full, in order that the reader may see to what truly pitiful sophistries "recent" empirio-critical philosophy resorts. We shall compare with the argument of the idealist Avenarius the <I>materialist</I> argument of -- Bogdanov, if only to punish Bogdanov for his betrayal of materialism! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In long bygone days, fully nine years ago, when Bogdanov was half "a natural-historical materialist" (that is, an adherent of the materialist theory of knowledge, to which the overwhelming majority of contemporary scientists instinctively hold), when he was only half led astray by the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 45</B></FONT><P>

muddled Ostwald, he wrote: "From ancient times to the present day, descriptive psychology has adhered to the classification of the facts of consciousness into three categories: the domain of sensations and ideas, the domain of emotions and the domain of impulses. . . . To the first category belong the <I>images</I> of phenomena of the outer or inner world, as taken by themselves in consciousness. . . . Such an image is called a 'sensation' if it is directly produced through the sense-organs by its corresponding external phenomenon."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp45">*</A>]</FONT> And a little farther on he says: "Sensation . . . arises in consciousness as a result of a certain impulse from the external environment transmitted by the external sense-organs" (p. 222). And further: "Sensation is the foundation of mental life; it is its immediate connection with the external world" (p. 240). "At each step in the process of sensation a transformation of the energy of external excitation into a state of consciousness takes place" (p. 133). And even in 1905 when with the gracious assistance of Ostwald and Mach Bogdanov had already abandoned the materialist standpoint in philosophy for the idealist standpoint, he wrote (from forgetfulness!) in his <I>Empirio-Monism </I>: "As is known, the energy of external excitation, transformed at the nerve-ends into a 'telegraphic' form of nerve current (still insufficiently investigated but devoid of all mysticism), first reaches the neurons that are located in the so-called 'lower' centres -- ganglial, cerebro-spinal, subcortical, etc." (Bk. I, 2nd ed., 1905, p. 118.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp

tion is indeed the direct connection between consciousness and the external world; it is the transformation of the energy of external excitation into a state of consciousness. This transformation has been, and is, observed by each of us a million times on every hand. The sophism of idealist philosophy consists in the fact that it regards sensation as being not the connection between consciousness and the external world, but a fence, a wall, separating consciousness from the external world -- not an image of the external phenomenon corresponding to the sensation, but as the "sole entity." Avenarius gave but a slightly changed form to this old sophism, which had been already worn threadbare by Bishop Berkeley. Since we do not yet know all the conditions of the connection we are constantly observing between sensation and matter organised in a definite way, let us therefore acknowledge the existence of sensation alone -- that is what the sophism of Avenarius reduces itself to. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    To conclude our description of the fundamental idealist premises of empirio-criticism, we shall briefly refer to the English and French representatives of this philosophical trend. Mach explicitly says of Karl Pearson, the Englishman, that he (Mach) is "in agreement with his epistemological (<I>erkenntniskritischen </I>) views on all essential points" (<I>Mechanik</I>, ed. previously cited, p. ix). Pearson in turn agrees with Mach.* For Pearson "real things" are "sense-impressions." He declares the recognition of things outside the boundaries of sense impressions to be metaphysics. Pearson fights materialism with great determination (although he does not know Feuerbach, or Marx and Engels); his arguments do not differ from

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 47</B></FONT><P>

those analysed above. However, the desire to masquerade as a materialist is so foreign to Pearson (that is a specialty of the Russian Machians), Pearson is so -- incautious, that he invents no "new" names for his philosophy and simply declares that his views and those of Mach are "<I>idealist </I>" (<I>ibid</I>., p. 326)! He traces his genealogy directly to Berkeley and Hume. The philosophy of Pearson, as we shall repeatedly find, is distinguished from that of Mach by its far greater integrity and consistency. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Mach explicitly declares his solidarity with the French physicists, Pierre Duhem and Henri Poincar&eacute.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp47">*</A>]</FONT> We shall have occasion to deal with the particularly confused and inconsistent philosophical views of these writers in the chapter on the new physics. Here we shall content ourselves with noting that for Poincar&eacute things are "groups of sensations"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp47">**</A>]</FONT> and that a similar view is casually expressed by Duhem.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp47">***</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    We shall now proceed to examine how Mach and Avenarius, having admitted the idealist character of their original views, <I>corrected</I> them in their subsequent works.

Mach.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp48">*</A>]</FONT> And this na&iumlve university lecturer must be given his due: in his simplicity of heart he does Machism more harm than good. At least, he puts the question point-blank -- did Mach really "discover the world-elements"? If so, then, only very backward and ignorant people, of course, can still remain materialists. Or is this discovery a return on the part of Mach to the old philosophical errors? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We saw that Mach in 1872 and Avenarius in 1876 held a purely idealist view; for them the world is our sensation. In 1883 Mach's <I>Mechanik</I> appeared, and in the preface to the first edition Mach refers to Avenarius' <I>Prolegomena</I>, and greets his ideas as being "very close" (<I>sehr verwandte </I>) to his own philosophy. Here are the arguments in the <I>Mechanik</I> concerning the elements: "All natural science can only picture and represent (<I>nachbilden und vorbilden </I>) complexes of those <I>elements</I> which we ordinarily call <I>sensations</I>. It is a matter of the connection of these elements. . . . The connection of A (heat) with B (flame) is a problem of <I>physics</I>, that of A and N (nerves) a problem of physiology. Neither exists <I>separately</I>; both exist in conjunction. Only temporarily can we neglect either. Even processcs that are apparently purely mechanical, are thus always physiological" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., German ed., p. 498). We find the same in the <I>Analysis of Sensations </I>: "Wherever . . . the terms 'sensation,' 'complex of sensations,' are used alongside of or in place of the terms 'element,' 'complex of elements,' it must be borne in mind

that it is <I>only</I> in this <I>connection</I> [namely, in the connection of A, B, C with K, L, M, that is, in the connection of "complexes which we ordinarily call bodies" with "the complex which we call our body"] and relation, only in this functional dependence that the elements are <I>sensations</I>. In another functional dependence they are at the same time physical objects" (Russian translation, pp. 23 and 17). "A colour is a physical object when we consider its dependence, for instance, upon the source of illumination (other colours, temperatures, spaces and so forth). When we, however, consider its <I>dependence</I> upon the <I>retina</I> (the elements K, L, M), it is a <I>psychological</I> object, a <I>sensation </I>" (<I>ibid</I>., p. 24). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus the discovery of the world-elements amounts to this: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   1)&nbsp;all that exists is declared to be sensation, 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   2)&nbsp;sensations are called elements, 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    3)&nbsp;elements are divided into the physical and the psychical; the latter is that which depends on the human nerves and the human organism generally; the former does not depend on them; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    4)&nbsp;the connection of physical elements and the connection of psychical elements, it is declared, do not exist separately from each other; they exist only in conjunction; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    5)&nbsp;it is possible only temporarily to leave one or the other connection out of account; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    6)&nbsp;the "new" theory is declared to be free from "one sidedness."* 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Indeed, it is not one-sidedness we have here, but an in coherent jumble of antithetical philosophical points of view. 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

Since you base yourself only on sensations you do not correct the "one-sidedness" of your idealism by the term "element," but only confuse the issue and cravenly hide from your own theory. In a word, you eliminate the antithesis between the physical and psychical,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp50">*</A>]</FONT> between materialism (which regards nature, matter, as primary) and idealism (which regards spirit, mind, sensation as primary); indeed, you promptly restore this antithesis; you restore it surreptitiously, retreating from your own fundamental premise! For, if elements are sensations, you have no right even for a moment to accept the existence of "elements" <I>independently</I> of my nerves and my mind. But if you do admit physical objects that are independent of my nerves and my sensations and that cause sensation only by acting upon my retina -- you are disgracefully abandoning your "one-sided" idealism and adopting the standpoint of "one-sided" materialism! If colour is a sensation only depending upon the retina (as natural science compels you to admit), then light rays, falling upon the retina, produce the sensation of colour. This means that outside us, independently of us and of our minds, there exists a movement of matter, let us say of ether waves of a definite length and of a definite velocity, which, acting upon the retina, produce in man the sensation of a particular colour. This is precisely how natural science regards it. It explains the sensations of various colours by the various lengths of light-waves existing outside the human retina, outside man and independently of him. This is

materialism: matter acting upon our sense-organs produces sensation. Sensation depends on the brain, nerves, retina, etc., <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., on matter organised in a definite way. The existence of matter does not depend on sensation. Matter is primary. Sensation, thought, consciousness are the supreme product of matter organised in a particular way. Such are the views of materialism in general, and of Marx and Engels in particular. Mach and Avenarius <I>secretly</I> smuggle in materialism by means of the word "element," which <I>supposedly</I> frees their theory of the "one-sidedness" of subjective idealism, <I>supposedly</I> permits the assumption that the mental is dependent on the retina, nerves and so forth, and the assumption that the physical is independent of the human organism. In fact, of course, the trick with the word "element" is a wretched sophistry, for a materialist who reads Mach and Avenarius will immediately ask: what are the "elements"? It would, indeed, be childish to think that one can dispose of the fundamental philosophical trends by inventing a new word. Either the "element" is a <I>sensation</I>, as all empirio-criticists, Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt,* etc., maintain -- in which case your philosophy, gentlemen, is <I>idealism</I> vainly seeking to hide the nakedness of its solipsism under the cloak of a more "objective" terminology; or the "element" is not a sensation -- in which case <I>absolutely no thought whatever</I> is attached to the "new" term; it is merely an empty bauble.

empirio-criticist describes him.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp52">*</A>]</FONT> Having defined elements as sensations, he says in the second volume of the work mentioned: "In the statement that 'sensations are the elements of the world' one must guard against taking the term 'sensation' as denoting something only subjective and therefore ethereal, transforming the ordinary picture of the world into an illusion (<I>Verfl&uumlchtigendes </I>)."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp52">**</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    One speaks of what hurts one most! Petzoldt feels that the world "evaporates" (<I>verfl&uumlchtigt sich </I>), or becomes transformed into an illusion, when sensations are regarded as world-elements. And the good Petzoldt imagines that he helps matters by the reservation that sensation must not be taken as something only subjective! Is this not a ridiculous sophistry? Does it make any difference whether we "take" sensation as sensation or whether we try to stretch the meaning of the term? Does this do away with the fact that sensations in man are connected with normally functioning nerves, retina, brain, etc., that the external world exists independently of our sensations? If you are not trying to evade the issue by a subterfuge, if you are really in earnest in wanting to "guard" against subjectivism and solipsism, you must above all guard against the fundamental idealist premises of your philosophy; you must replace the idealist line of your philosophy (from sensations to the external world) by the materialist line (from the external world to sensations); you must abandon that empty and muddled verbal embellishment, "element," and simply say that colour is the result of the action of a physical object on the retina, which is the same

    Let us take Avenarius. The most valuable material on the question of the "elements" is to be found in his last work (and, it might be said, the most important for the comprehension of his philosophy), <I>Notes on the Concept of the Subject of Psychology</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp53">*</A>]</FONT> The author, by the way, here gives a very "graphic" table (Vol. XVIII, p. 410), the main part of which we reproduce here:

   Compare this with what Mach says after all his elucidation of the "elements" (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 33): "It is not bodies that produce sensations, but complexes of elements (complexes of sensations) that make up bodies." Here you have the "discovery of the world-elements" that overcomes the one-sidedness of idealism and materialism! At first we are assured that the "elements" are something new, both physical and psychical at the same time; then a little correction is surreptitiously inserted: instead of the crude, materialist differentiation of matter (bodies, things) and the psychical (sensations, recollections, fantasies) we are presented with the doctrine of "recent positivism" regarding elements substantial and elements mental. Adler (Fritz) did not gain very much from "the discovery of the world-elements"!

general philosophical conception there is only one thing I borrowed from Mach -- the idea of the neutrality of the elements of experience in relation to the 'physical' and 'psychical,' and the dependence of these characteristics solely on the <I>connection</I> of experience." (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, St. Petersburg, 1906, p. xli.) This is as though a religious man were to say -- I cannot own myself a believer in religion, for there is "only one thing" I have borrowed from the believers -- the belief in God. This "only one thing" which Bogdanov borrowed from Mach is the <I>basic error</I> of Machism, the basic falsity of its entire philosophy. Those deviations of Bogdanov's from empirio-criticism to which he himself attaches great significance are in fact of entirely secondary importance and amount to nothing more than inconsiderable private and individual differences between the various empirio-criticists who are approved by Mach and who approve Mach (we shall speak of this in greater detail later). Hence when Bogdanov was annoyed at being confused with the Machians he only revealed his failure to understand what <I>radically</I> distinguishes materialism from what is common to Bogdanov and to all other Machians. How Bogdanov developed, improved or worsened Machism is not important What is important is that he has abandoned the materialist standpoint and has thereby inevitably condemned himself to confusion and idealist aberrations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In 1899, as we saw, Bogdanov had the correct standpoint when he wrote: "The image of the man before me, directly given to me by vision, is a sensation."* Bogdanov did not trouble to give a criticism of this earlier position of his. He

blindly believed Mach and began to repeat after him that the "elements" of experience are neutral in relation to the physical and psychical. "As has been established by recent positivist philosophy," wrote Bogdanov in Book I of <I>Empirio-Monism</I> (2nd ed., p. 90), "the elements of psychical experience are identical with the elements of experience in general, as they are identical with the elements of physical experience." Or in 1906 (Bk. III, p. xx): "as to 'idealism,' can it be called idealism merely on the grounds that the elements of 'physical experience' are regarded as identical with the elements of 'psychical experience,' or with elementary sensations -- when this is simply an indubitable fact?" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here we have the true source of all Bogdanov's philosophical misadventures, a source which he shares with the rest of the Machians. We can and must call it idealism when "the elements of physical experience" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the physical, the external world, matter) are regarded as identical with sensations, for this is sheer Berkeleianism. There is not a trace here of recent philosophy, or positivist philosophy, or of indubitable fact. It is merely an old, old idealist sophism. And were one to ask Bogdanov how he would prove the "indubitable fact" that the physical is identical with sensations, one would get no other argument save the eternal refrain of the idealists: I am aware only of my sensations; the "testimony of self-consciousness" (<I>die Aussage des Selbstbewusstseins </I>) of Avenarius in his <I>Prolegomena</I> (2nd German ed., &#167; 93, p. 56); or: "in our experience [which testifies that "we are sentient substance"] sensation is given us with more certainty than is substantiality" (<I>ibid</I>., &#167; 91, p. 55), and so on and so forth. Bogdanov (trusting Mach) accepted a reactionary philosophical trick as an "indubitable fact." For, indeed, not a single fact was or could be cited which would refute the 


<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 56</B></FONT><P>

view that sensation is an image of the external world -- a view which was shared by Bogdanov in 1899 and which is shared by natural science to this day. In his philosophical wanderings the physicist Mach has completely strayed from the path of "modern science." Regarding this important circumstance, which Bogdanov overlooked, we shall have much to say later. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One of the circumstances which helped Bogdanov to jump so quickly from the materialism of the natural scientists to the muddled idealism of Mach was (apart from the influence of Ostwald) Avenarius' doctrine of the dependent and independent series of experience. Bogdanov himself expounds the matter in Book I of his <I>Empirio-Monism</I> thus: "In so far as the data of experience appear <I>in dependence upon the state of the particular nervous system, they form the psychical world</I> of the particular person, in so far as the data of experience are taken <I>outside of such a dependence</I>, we have before us the <I>physical world</I>. Avenarius therefore characterises these two realms of experience respectively as the <I>dependent series</I> and the <I>independent series</I> of experience" (p. 18). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is just the whole trouble, the doctrine of the <I>independent</I> (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., independent of human sensation) "series" is a surreptitious importation of materialism, which, from the standpoint of a philosophy that maintains that bodies are complexes of sensations, that sensations are "identical" with physical "elements," is illegitimate, arbitrary, and eclectic. For once you have recognised that the source of light and light-waves exists <I>independently</I> of man and the human consciousness, that colour is dependent on the action of these waves upon the retina, you have in fact adopted the materialist standpoint and have <I>completely destroyed</I> all the "indubitable facts" of idealism, together with all "the complexes of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 57</B></FONT><P>

sensations," the elements discovered by recent positivism, and similar nonsense. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is just the whole trouble. Bogdanov (like the rest of the Russian Machians) has never looked into the idealist views originally held by Mach and Avenarius, has never understood their fundamental idealist premises, and has therefore failed to discover the illegitimacy and eclecticism of their subsequent attempts to smuggle in materialism surreptitiously. Yet, just as the initial idealism of Mach and Avenarius is generally acknowledged in philosophical literature, so is it generally acknowledged that subsequently empirio-criticism endeavoured to swing towards materialism. Cauwelaert, the French writer quoted above, asserts that Avenarius' <I>Prolegomena</I> is "monistic idealism," the Critique of Pure Experience (1888-90) is "absolute realism," while <I>The Human Concept of the World</I> (1891) is an attempt "to explain" the change. Let us note that the term realism is here employed as the antithesis of idealism. Following Engels, I use <I>only</I> the term materialism in this sense, and consider it the sole correct terminology, especially since the term "realism" has been bedraggled by the positivists and the other muddleheads who oscillate between materialism and idealism. For the present it will suffice to note that Cauwelaert had the indisputable fact in mind that in the <I>Prolegomena</I> (1876) sensation, accord ing to Avenarius, is the only entity, while "substance" -- in accordance with the principle of "the economy of thought"! -- is eliminated, and that in the <I>Critique of Pure Experience</I> the physical is taken as the <I>independent series</I>, while the psychical and, consequently, sensations, are taken as the dependent series. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Avenarius' disciple Rudolf Willy likewise admits that Avenarius was a "complete" idealist in 1876, but subsequently 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 58</B></FONT><P>

"reconciled" (<I>Ausgleich </I>) "na&iumlve realism" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the instinctive, unconscious materialist standpoint adopted by humanity, which regards the external world as existing independently of our minds) with this teaching (<I>loc</I>. <I>cit</I>.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Oskar Ewald, the author of the book <I>Avenarius as the Founder of Empirio-Criticism</I>, says that this philosophy combines contradictory idealist and "realist" (he should have said materialist) elements (not in Mach's sense, but in the human sense of the term element). For example, "the absolute [method of consideration] would perpetuate na&iumlve realism, the relative would declare exclusive idealism as permanent."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp58">*</A>]</FONT> Avenarius calls the absolute method of consideration that which corresponds to Mach's connection of "elements" outside our body, and the relative that which corresponds to Mach's connection of "elements" dependent on our body. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But of particular interest to us in this respect is the opinion of Wundt, who himself, like the majority of the above mentioned writers, adheres to the confused idealist standpoint, but who has analysed empirio-criticism perhaps more attentively than all the others. P. Yushkevich has the follow ing to say in this connection: "It is interesting to note that Wundt regards empirio-criticism as the most scientific form of the latest type of materialism,"** <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the type of those materialists who regard the spiritual as a function of corporeal processes (and whom -- we would add -- Wundt de-

fines as standing midway between Spinozism and absolute materialism).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp59">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    True, this opinion of Wundt's is extremely interesting. But what is even more "interesting" is Mr. Yushkevich's attitude towards the books and articles on philosophy of which he treats. This is a typical example of the attitude of our<A NAME="p59"> Machians to such matters. Gogol's Petrushka<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en25">25</A>]</FONT> used to read and find it interesting that letters always combined to make words. Mr. Yushkevich read Wundt and found it "interesting" that Wundt accused Avenarius of materialism. If Wundt is wrong, why not refute him? If he is right, why not explain the antithesis between materialism and empirio-criticism? Mr. Yushkevich finds what the idealist Wundt says "interesting," but this Machian regards it as a waste of effort to endeavour to go to the root of the matter (probably on the principle of "the economy of thought"). . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The point is that by informing the reader that Wundt accuses Avenarius of materialism, and by not informing him that Wundt regards some aspects of empirio-criticism as materialism and others as idealism and holds that the connection between the two is artificial, Yushkevich <I>entirely distorted the matter</I>. Either this gentleman absolutely does not understand what he reads, or he was prompted by a desire to indulge in false self-praise with the help of Wundt, as if to say: you see, the official professors regard us, too, as materialists, and not as muddleheads. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The above-mentioned article by Wundt constitutes a large book (more than 300 pages), devoted to a detailed analysis first of the immanentist school, and then of the empirio-

criticists. Why did Wundt connect these two schools? Because he considers them <I>closely akin </I>; and this opinion, which is shared by Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt and the immanentists is, as we shall see later, entirely correct. Wundt shows in the first part of this article that the immanentists are idealists, subjectivists and adherents of fideism. This, too, as we shall see later, is a perfectly correct opinion, although Wundt expounds it with a superfluous ballast of professorial erudition, with superfluous niceties and reservations, which is to be explained by the fact that Wundt himself is an idealist and fideist. He reproaches the immanentists not because they are idealists and adherents of fideism, but because, in his opinion, they arrive at these great principles by incorrect methods. Further, the second and third parts of Wundt's article are devoted to empirio-criticism. There he quite definitely points out that very important theoretical propositions of empirio-criticism (<I>e</I>.<I>g</I>., the interpretation of "experience" and the "principal co-ordination," of which we shall speak later) are <I>identical</I> with those held by the immanentists (<I>die empiriokritische<A NAME="p60"> in Uebereinstimmung mit der immanenten Philosophie annimmt</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en26">26</A>]</FONT> S. 382). Other of Avenarius' theoretical propositions are borrowed from materialism, and in general empirio-criticism is a "motley" (<I>bunte Mischung</I>, <I>ibid</I>., S. 57), in which the "various component elements are entirely heterogeneous" (<I>an sich einander v&oumlllig heterogen sind</I>, S. 56). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Wundt regards Avenarius' doctrine of the "independent vital series," in particular, as one of the materialist morsels of the Avenarius-Mach hotchpotch. If you start from the "system C" (that is how Avenarius -- who was very fond of making erudite play of new terms -- designates the human brain or the nervous system in general), and if the mental is for you a function of the brain, then this "system C" is a 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 61</B></FONT><P>

"metaphysical substance" -- says Wundt (<I>ibid</I>., p. 64), and your doctrine is materialism. It should be said that many idealists and all agnostics (Kantians and Humeans included) call the materialists metaphysicians, because it seems to them that to recognise the existence of an external world independent of the human mind is to transcend the bounds of experience. Of this terminology and its utter incorrectness from the point of view of Marxism, we shall speak in its proper place. Here it is important to note that the recognition of the "independent" series by Avenarius (and also by Mach, who expresses the same idea in different words) is, according to the general opinion of philosophers of various parties, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of various trends in philosophy, an <I>appropriation from materialism</I>. If you assume that everything that exists is sensation, or that bodies are complexes of sensations, you cannot, without violating all your fundamental premises, all "your" philosophy, arrive at the conclusion that the <I>physical</I> exists <I>independently</I> of our minds, and that sensation is a <I>function</I> of matter organised in a definite way. Mach and Avenarius, in their philosophy, combine fundamental idealist premises with individual materialist deductions for the very reason that their theory is an example<A NAME="p61"> of that "pauper's broth of eclecticism"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en27">27</A>]</FONT> of which Engels speaks with just contempt.*

* The foreword to <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>, dated February 1888. These words of Engels' refer to German professorial philosophy in general. The Machians who would like to be Marxists, being unable to grasp the significance and meaning of this thought of Engels', sometimes take refuge in a wretched evasion: "Engels did not yet know Mach" (Fritz Adler in <I>Hist</I>. <I>Mat</I>., p. 370). On what is this opinion based? On the fact that Engels does not cite Mach and Avenarius? There are no other grounds, and these grounds are worthless, for Engels does not mention any of the eclectics by name, and it is hardly likely that Engels did not know Avenarius, who had been editing a quarterly of "scientific" philosophy ever since 1876. 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 62</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  This eclecticism is particularly marked in Mach's latest philosophical work, <I>Knowledge and Error</I>, 2nd edition, 1906. We have already seen that Mach there declared that "there is no difficulty in constructing every physical element out of sensation, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., out of psychical elements," and in the same book we read: "Dependencies outside the boundary U [ = Umgrenzung, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., "the spatial boundary of our body," S. 8] are physics in the broadest sense" (S. 323, &#167; 4). "To obtain those dependencies in a pure state (<I>rein erhalten </I>) it is necessary as much as possible to eliminate the influence of the observer, that is, of those elements<A NAME="p62"> that lie within U" (<I>loc</I>. <I>cit</I>.). Well, well, the titmouse first promised to set the sea on fire<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en28">28</A>]</FONT>. . . <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., to construct physical elements from psychical elements, and then it turns out that physical elements lie beyond the boundary of psychical elements, "which lie within our body"! A remarkable philosophy! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Another example: "A perfect (<I>vollkommenes </I>) gas, a perfect liquid, a perfect elastic body, does not exist; the physicist knows that his fictions only approximate to the facts and arbitrarily simplify them; he is aware of the divergence, which cannot be eliminated" (S. 418, &#167; 30). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What divergence (<I>Abweichung</I>) is meant here? The divergence of what from what? Of thought (physical theory) from the facts. And what are thoughts, ideas? Ideas are the "tracks of sensations" (S. 9). And what are facts? Facts are "complexcs of sensations." And so, the divergence of the tracks of sensations from complexes of sensations cannot be eliminated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What does this mean? It means that Mach forgets his own theory and, when treating of various problems of physics, speaks plainly, without idealist twists, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialistically. All the "complexes of sensations" and the entire stock of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 63</B></FONT><P>

Berkeleian wisdom vanish. The physicists' theory proves to be a reflection of bodies, liquids, gases existing outside us and independently of us, a reflection which is, of course, approximate; but to call this approximation or simplification "arbitrary" is wrong. <I>In fact</I>, sensation is here regarded by Mach just as it is regarded by all science which has not been "purified" by the disciples of Berkeley and Hume, <I>viz</I>., as an <I>image of the external world</I>. Mach's own theory is subjective idealism; but when the factor of objectivity is required, Mach unceremoniously inserts into his arguments the premises of the contrary, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the materialist, theory of knowledge. Eduard von Hartmann, a consistent idealist and consistent reactionary in philosophy, <I>who sympathises with the Machians' fight against materialism</I>, comes very close to the truth when he says that Mach's philosophical position is a "mixture (<I>Nichtunterscheidung </I>) of na&iumlve realism and absolute illusionism."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp63">*</A>]</FONT> That is true. The doctrine that bodies are complexes of sensations, etc., is absolute illusionism, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., solipsism; for from this standpoint the world is nothing but my illusion. On the other hand, Mach's afore-mentioned argument, as well as many other of his fragmentary arguments, is what is known as "na&iumlve realism," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the materialist theory of knowledge unconsciously and instinctively taken over from the scientists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Avenarius and the professors who follow in his footsteps attempt to disguise this mixture by the theory of the "principal co-ordination." We shall proceed to examine this theory presently, but let us first finish with the charge that Avenarius is a materialist. Mr. Yushkevich, to whom Wundt's opinion which he failed to understand seemed so interesting, was

either himself not enough interested to learn, or else did not condescend to inform the reader, how Avenarius' nearest disciples and successors reacted to this charge. Yet this is necessary to clarify the matter if we are interested in the relation of Marx's philosophy, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialism, to the philosophy of empirio-criticism. Moreover, if Machism is a muddle, a mixture of materialism and idealism, it is important to know whither this current turned -- if we may so express it -- after the official idealists began to disown it because of its concessions to materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Wundt was answered, among others, by two of Avenarius' purest and most orthodox disciples, J. Petzoldt and Fr. Carstanjen. Petzoldt, with haughty resentment, repudiated the charge of materialism, which is so degrading to a German professor, and in support referred to -- what do you think? --  Avenarius' <I>Prolegomena</I>, where, forsooth, the concept of substance has been annihilated! A convenient theory, indeed, that can be made to embrace both purely idealist works and arbitrarily assumed materialist premises! Avenarius' <I>Critique of Pure Experience</I>, of course, does not contradict this teaching, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialism, writes Petzoldt, but neither does it contradict the directly opposite spiritualist doctrine.* An excellent defence! This is exactly what Engels called "a pauper's broth of eclecticism." Bogdanov, who refuses to own himself a Machian and who wants to be considered a Marxist (<I>in philosophy </I>), follows Petzoldt. He asserts that "empirio-criticism is not . . . concerned with materialism, or with spiritualism, or with metaphysics in general,"** that

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Carstanjen, rebutting Wundt, said that he absolutely repudiated this "importation (<I>Unterschiebung</I>) of a materialist element" which is utterly foreign to the critique of pure experience."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp65">**</A>]</FONT> "Empirio-criticism is scepticism  [<FONT SIZE=-2>followed by the word  written in Greek. -- <I>DJR</I></FONT>] (pre-eminently) in relation to the content of the concepts." There is a grain of truth in this insistent emphasis on the neutrality of Machism; the amendment made by Mach and Avenarius to their original idealism amounts to partial concessions to materialism. Instead of the consistent standpoint of Berkeley -- the external world is my sensation -- we some times get the Humean standpoint -- I exclude the question whether or not there is anything beyond my sensations. And this agnostic standpoint inevitably condemns one to vacillate between materialism and idealism.

<I>Notes</I>. The second was written later, and in it Avenarius emphasises that he is expounding, it is true in a somewhat altered form, something that is not different from the <I>Critique of Pure Experience</I> and <I>The Human Concept of the World</I>, but <I>exactly the same</I> (<I>Notes</I>, 1894, S. 137 in the journal quoted above). The essence of this doctrine is the thesis of "the <I>indissoluble</I> (<I>unaufl&oumlsliche </I>) <I>co-ordination</I> [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the correlative connection] <I>of the self and the environment </I>" (p. 146). "Expressed philosophically," Avenarius says here, one can say the "<I>self</I> and <I>not-self</I>." We "<I>always</I> find together" (<I>immer ein Zusammenvorgefundenes </I>) the one and the other, the <I>self</I> and the environment. "No full description of what we find (<I>des Vorgefundenen </I>) can contain an 'environment' without some <I>self</I> (<I>ohne ein Ich </I>) <I>whose</I> environment it is, even though it be only the <I>self</I> that is describing what is found (<I>das Vorgefundene </I>)" (p. 146). The <I>self</I> is called the <I>central term</I> of the co-ordination, the environment the <I>counter-term</I> (<I>Gegenglied </I>). (Cf. <I>Der menschliche Weltbegriff</I>, 2. Auflage, 1905, S. 83-84, &#167; 148 ff.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Avenarius claims that by this doctrine he recognises the full value of what is known as na&iumlve realism, that is, the ordinary, non-philosophical, na&iumlve view which is entertained by all people who do not trouble themselves as to whether they themselves exist and whether the environment, the external world, exists. Expressing his solidarity with Avenarius, Mach also tries to represent himself as a defender of "na&iumlve realism" (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 39). The Russian Machians, without exception, believed Mach's and Avenarius' claim that this was indeed a defence of "na&iumlve realism": the <I>self</I> is acknowledged, the environment is acknowledged -- what more do you want? 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 67</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In order to decide who actually possesses the greatest degree of <I>na&iumlvet&eacute</I>, let us proceed from a somewhat remote starting point. Here is a popular dialogue between a certain philosopher and his reader: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>Reader </I>: The existence of a system of things [according to ordinary philosophy] is required and from them only is consciousness to be derived. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>Author </I>: Now you are speaking in the spirit of a professional philosopher . . . and not according to human common sense and actual consciousness. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Tell me, and reflect well before you answer: Does a thing appear in you and become present in you and for you otherwise than simultaneously with and through your consciousness of the thing? . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>Reader </I>: Upon sufficient reflection, I must grant you this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>Author </I>: Now you are speaking from yourself, from your heart. Take care, therefore, not to jump out of yourself and to apprehend anything otherwise than you are able to apprehend it, as consciousness <I>and</I> [the italics are the philosopher's] the thing, the thing <I>and</I> consciousness; or, more precisely, neither the one nor the other, but that which only subsequently becomes resolved into the two, that which is the absolute subjective-objective and objective-subjective." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here you have the whole essence of the empirio-critical principal co-ordination, the latest defence of "na&iumlve realism" by the latest positivism! The idea of "indissoluble" co-ordination is here stated very clearly and as though it were a genuine defence of the point of view of the common man, uncorrupted by the subtleties of "the professional philosophers." But, as a matter of fact, this dialogue is taken from 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 68</B></FONT><P>

the work of a classical representative of subjective idealism, Johann Gottlieb <I>Fichte</I>, <I>published in 1801</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp68">*</A>]</FONT>

    There is nothing but a paraphrase of subjective idealism in the teachings of Mach and Avenarius we are examining. The claim that they have risen above materialism and idealism, that they have eliminated the opposition between the point of view that proceeds from the thing <I>to</I> consciousness and the contrary point of view -- is but the empty claim of a renovated Fichteanism. Fichte too imagined that he had "indissolubly" connected the "self" and the "environment," the consciousness and the thing; that he had "solved" the problem by the assertion that a man cannot jump out of himself. In other words, the Berkeleian argument is repeated: I perceive only my sensations, I have no right to assume "objects in themselves" outside of my sensation. The different methods of expression used by Berkeley in 1710, by Fichte in 1801, and by Avenarius in 1891-94 do not in the least change the essence of the matter, <I>viz</I>., the fundamental philosophical line of subjective idealism. The world is my sensation; the non-<I>self</I> is "postulated" (is created, produced) by the <I>self </I>; the thing is indissolubly connected with the consciousness; the indissoluble co-ordination of the <I>self</I> and the environment is the empirio-critical principal co-ordination; -- this is all one and the same proposition, the same old trash with a slightly refurbished, or repainted, signboard. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The reference to "na&iumlve realism," supposedly defended by this philosophy, is <I>sophistry</I> of the cheapest kind. The "na&iumlve

realism" of any healthy person who has not been an inmate of a lunatic asylum or a pupil of the idealist philosophers consists in the view that things, the environment, the world, exist <I>independently</I> of our sensation, of our consciousness, of our <I>self</I> and of man in general. The same <I>experience</I> (not in the Machian sense, but in the human sense of the term) that has produced in us the firm conviction that <I>independently</I> of us there exist other people, and not mere complexes of my sensations of high, short, yellow, hard, etc. -- this same <I>experience</I> produces in us the conviction that things, the world, the environment exist independently of us. Our sensation, our consciousness is only <I>an image</I> of the external world, and it is obvious that an image cannot exist without the thing imaged, and that the latter exists independently of that which images it. Materialism <I>deliberately</I> makes the "na&iumlve" belief of mankind the foundation of its theory of knowledge. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is not the foregoing evaluation of the "principal co-ordination" a product of the materialist prejudice against Machism? Not at all. Specialists in philosophy who cannot be accused of partiality towards materialism, who even detest it and who accept one or other of the idealist systems, agree that the principal co-ordination of Avenarius and Co. is subjective idealism. Wundt, for instance, whose interesting opinion was not understood by Mr. Yushkevich, explicitly states that Avenarius' theory, according to which a full description of the given or the found is impossible without some <I>self</I>, an observer or describer, is "a false confusion of the content of real experience with reflections about it." Natural science, says Wundt, completely abstracts from every observer. "Such abstraction is possible only because the attribution (<I>Hinzudenken </I>) of an experiencing individual to every content of experience, which the empirio-critical philosophy, in agree-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 70</B></FONT><P>

ment with the immanentist philosophy, assumes, is in general an empirically unfounded assumption arising from a false confusion of the content of real experience with reflections about it" (<I>loc</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 382). For the immanentists (Schuppe, Rehmke, Leclair, Schubert-Soldern), who themselves voice -- as we shall see later -- their hearty sympathy with Avenarius, proceed from this very idea of the "indissoluble" connection between subject and object. And W. Wundt, before analysing Avenarius, demonstrated in detail that the immanentist philosophy is only a "modification" of Berkeleianism that however much the immanentists may deny their kinship with Berkeley we should not allow verbal differences to conceal from us the "deeper content of these philosophical doctrines," <I>viz</I>., Berkeleianism or Fichteanism.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp70">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The English writer Norman Smith, analysing Avenarius' <I>Philosophy of Pure Experience</I>, puts this criticism in an even more straightforward and emphatic form: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "Most readers of Avenarius' <I>The Human Concept of the World</I> will probably agree that, however convincing as criticism [of idealism], it is tantalisingly illusive in its positive teaching. So long as we seek to interpret his theory of experience in the form in which it is avowedly presented, namely, as genuinely realistic, it eludes all clear comprehension: its whole meaning seems to be exhausted in negation of the subjectivism which it overthrows. It is only when we translate Avenarius' technical terms into more familiar language that we discover where the real source of the mystification lies. Avenarius has diverted attention from the defects of his posi-

Sometimes it means experiencing and at other times the experienced, the latter meaning being emphasised when the nature of the <I>self</I> is in question. These two meanings of the term experience practically coincide with his important distinction between the absolute and the relative standpoints [I have examined above what significance this distinction has for Avenarius]; and these two points of view are not in his philosophy really reconciled. For when he allows as legitimate the demand that experience be ideally completed in thought [the full description of the environment is ideally completed by thinking of an observing <I>self </I>], he makes an admission which he cannot successfully combine with his assertion that nothing exists save in relation to the <I>self</I>. The ideal completion of given reality which results from the analysis of material bodies into elements which no human senses can apprehend [here are meant the material elements discovered by natural science, the atoms, electrons, etc., and not the fictitious elements invented by Mach and Avenarius], or from following the earth back to a time when no human being existed upon it, is, strictly, not a completion of experience but only of what is experienced. It completes only one of the two aspects which Avenarius has asserted to be inseparable. It leads us not only to what has not been experienced but to what can never by any possibility be experienced by beings like ourselves. But here again the ambiguities of the term experi-

ence come to Avenarius' rescue. He argues that thought is as genuine a form of experience as sense-perception, and so in the end falls back on the time-worn argument of subjective idealism, that thought and reality are inseparable, because reality can only be conceived in thought, and thought involves the presence of the thinker. Not, therefore, any original and profound re-establishment of realism, but only the restatement in its crudest form of the familiar position of subjective idealism is the final outcome of Avenarius' positive speculations" (p. 29). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The mystification wrought by Avenarius, who completely duplicates Fichte's error, is here excellently exposed. The much-vaunted elimination of the antithesis between materialism (Norman Smith should not have used the term realism) and idealism by means of the term "experience" instantly proves to be a myth as soon as we proceed to definite and concrete problems. Such, for instance, is the problem of the existence of the earth <I>prior</I> to man, <I>prior</I> to any sentient being. We shall presently speak of this point in detail. Here we will note that not only Norman Smith, an opponent of his theory, but also W. Schuppe, the immanentist, who warmly greeted the appearance of <I>The Human Concept of the World</I> as <I>a confirmation of na&iumlve realism </I>* unmasks Avenarius and his fictitious "realism." The fact of the matter is that Schuppe <I>fully</I> agrees with <I>such</I> "realism," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the mystification of materialism dished out by Avenarius. Such "realism," he wrote to Avenarius, I, the immanentist philosopher, who have been slandered as a subjective idealist, have always claimed with as much right as yourself, <I>hochverehrter Herr Kollege</I>.

"My conception of thought . . . excellently harmonises (<I>vertr&aumlgt sich vortrefflich </I>) with your 'Theory of pure experience'" (p. 384). "The connection and inseparability of the two terms of the co-ordination" are in fact provided only by the <I>self</I> (<I>das Ich</I>, the abstract, Fichtean self-consciousness, thought divorced from the brain). "That which you desired to eliminate you have tacitly assumed" -- so Schuppe wrote to Avenarius (p. 388). And it is difficult to say who more rudely unmasks Avenarius the mystifier -- Smith by his straightforward and clear refutation, or Schuppe by his enthusiastic opinion of Avenarius' crowning work. The kiss of<A NAME="p73"> Wilhelm Schuppe in philosophy is no better than the kiss of Peter Struve or Menshikov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en30">30</A>]</FONT> in politics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   O. Ewald, who praises Mach for not succumbing to materialism, speaks of the principal co-ordination in a similar manner: "If one declares the correlation of central term and counter-term to be an epistemological necessity which cannot be avoided, then, even though the word 'empirio-criticism' be inscribed on the signboard in shrieking letters, one is adopting a standpoint that differs in no way from absolute idealism. [The term is incorrect; he should have said subjective idealism, for Hegel's absolute idealism is reconcilable with the existence of the earth, nature, and the physical universe without man, since nature is regarded as the "otherness" of the absolute idea.] On the other hand, if we do not hold fast to this co-ordination and grant the counter-terms their independence, then the way is at once opened for every metaphysical possibility, especially in the direction of transcendental realism" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 56-57). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   By metaphysics and transcendental realism, Herr Friedlander, who is disguised under the pseudonym Ewald, means <I>materialism</I>. Himself professing one of the varieties of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 74</B></FONT><P>

idealism, he fully agrees with the Machians and the Kantians that materialism is metaphysics -- "from beginning to end the wildest metaphysics" (p. 134). On the question of the "transcendence" and the metaphysical character of materialism he is in agreement with Bazarov and all our Machians, and of this we shall have occasion to say more later. Here again it is important to note how <I>in fact</I> the shallow and pedantic claim to have transcended idealism and materialism vanishes, and how the question arises inexorably and irreconcilably. "To grant the counter-terms their independence" means (if one translates the pretentious language of the affected Avenarius into common parlance) to regard nature and the external world as independent of human consciousness and sensation. And that is materialism. To build a theory of knowledge on the hypothesis of the indissoluble connection between the object and human sensation ("complexes of sensations" as identical with bodies; "world-elements" that are identical both psychically and physically; Avenarius' co-ordination, and so forth) is to land inevitably into idealism. Such is the simple and unavoidable truth that with a little attention may be easily detected beneath the piles of affected quasi-erudite terminology of Avenarius, Schuppe, Ewald and the others, which deliberately obscures matters and frightens the general public away from philosophy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "reconciliation" of Avenarius' theory with "na&iumlve realism" in the end aroused misgivings even among his own disciples. For instance, R. Willy says that the common<A NAME="p74"> assertion that Avenarius came to adopt "na&iumlve realism" should be taken <I>cum grano salis</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en31">31</A>]</FONT> "As a dogma, na&iumlve realism would be nothing but the belief in things-in-themselves existing 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 75</B></FONT><P>

outside man (<I>ausserpers&oumlnliche </I>) in their percepiible form."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp75">*</A>]</FONT> In other words, the only theory of knowledge that is really created by an actual and not fictitious agreement with "na&iumlve realism" is, according to Willy, materialism! And Willy, of course, rejects materialism. But he is compelled to admit that Avenarius in <I>The Human Concept of the World</I> restores the unity of "experience," the unity of the "self" and the environment "by means of a series of complicated and extremely artificial subsidiary and intermediary conceptions" (p. 171). <I>The Human Concept of the World</I>, being a reaction against the original idealism of Avenarius, "entirely bears the character of a <I>reconciliation</I> (<I>eines Ausgleiches </I>) between the na&iumlve realism of common sense and the epistemological idealism of school philosophy. But that such a reconciliation could restore the unity and integrity of experience [Willy calls it <I>Grunderfahrung</I>, that is, basic experience -- another new world!], I would not assert" (p. 170). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A valuable admission! Avenarius' "experience" failed to reconcile idealism and materialism. Willy, it seems, repudiates the <I>school philosophy</I> of experience in order to replace it by a philosophy of "basic" experience, which is confusion thrice confounded. . . .

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  We have already seen that this question is particularly repugnant to the philosophy of Mach and Avenarius. Natural science positively asserts that the earth once existed in such a state that no man or any other creature existed or could

have existed on it. Organic matter is a later phenomenon, the fruit of a long evolution. It follows that there was no sentient matter, no "complexes of sensations," no <I>self</I> that was supposedly "indissolubly" connected with the environment in accordance with Avenarius' doctrine. Matter is primary, and thought, consciousness, sensation are products of a very high develoyment. Such is the materialist theory of knowledge, to which natural science instinctively subscribes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The question arises, have the eminent representatives of empirio-criticism observed this contradiction between their theory and natural science? They have observed it, and they have definitely asked themselves by what arguments this contradiction can be removed. Three attitudes to this question are of particular interest from the point of view of materialism, that of Avenarius himself and those of his disciples J. Petzoldt and R. Willy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Avenarius tries to eliminate the contradiction to natural science by means of the theory of the "potential" central term in the co-ordination. As we know, co-ordination is the "indissoluble" connection between self and environment. In order to eliminate the obvious absurdity of this theory the concept of the "potential" central term is introduced. For instance, what about man's development from the embryo? Does the environment (the "counter-term") exist if the "central term" is represented by an embryo? The embryonic system C -- Avenarius replies -- is the "potential<A NAME="p76"> central term in relation to the future individual environment" (<I>Notes</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en32">32</A>]</FONT> p. I40). The potential central term is never equal to zero, even when there are as yet no parents (<I>elterliche Bestandteile </I>), but only the "integral parts of the environment" capable of becoming parents (p. 141). 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 77</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The co-ordination then is indissoluble. It is essential for the empirio-criticist to assert this in order to save the fundamentals of his philosophy -- sensations and their complexes. Man is the central term of this co-ordination. But when there is no man, when he has not yet been born, the central term is nevertheless not equal to zero; it has only become a <I>potential</I> central term ! It is astonishing that there are people who can take seriously a philosopher who advances such arguments! Even Wundt, who stipulates that he is not an enemy of every form of metaphysics (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of fideism), was compelled to admit "the mystical obscuration of the concept experience" by the word "potential," which destroys coordination entirely (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 379). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And, indeed, how can one seriously speak of a co-ordination the indissolubility of which consists in one of its terms being potential? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is this not mysticism, the very antechamber of fideism? If it is possible to think of the potential central term in relation to a future environment, why not think of it in relation to a past environment, that is, <I>after man's death </I>? You will say that Avenarius did not draw this conclusion from his theory? Granted, but that absurd and reactionary theory became the more cowardly but not any the better for that. Avenarius, in 1894, did not carry this theory to its logical conclusion, or perhaps feared to do so. But R. Schubert Soldern, as we shall see, resorted in 1896 to <I>this very theory</I> to arrive at theological conclusions, which in 1906 earned the <I>approval</I> of Mach, who said that Schubert-Soldern was following "<I>very close paths </I>" (to Machism). (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 4.) Engels was quite right in attacking D&uumlhring, an avowed atheist, for inconsistently <I>leaving loopholes</I> for fideism in his philosophy. Engels several times. and justly, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 78</B></FONT><P>

brought this accusation against the materialist D&uumlhring, although the latter had not drawn any theological conclusions, in the 'seventies at least. But we have among us people who would have us regard them as Marxists, yet who bring to the masses a philosophy which comes very close to fideism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . It would seem," Avenarius wrote in the <I>Bemerkungen</I> "that from the empirio-critical standpoint natural science is not entitled to enquire about periods of our present environment which in time preceded the existence of man" (S. 144). Avenarius answers: "The enquirer cannot avoid mentally projecting himself" (<I>sich hinzuzudenken</I>, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., imagining one self to be present). "For" -- Avenarius continues -- "what the scientist wants (although he may not be clearly aware of it) is essentially only this: how is the earth to be defined prior to the appearance of living beings or man if I were mentally to project myself in the role of a spectator -- in much the same way as though it were thinkable that we could from our earth follow the history of another star or of another solar system with the help of perfected instruments." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   An object cannot exist independently of our consciousness. "We always mentally project ourselves as the intelligence endeavouring to apprehend the object." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This theory of the necessity of "mentally projecting" the human mind to every object and to nature prior to man is given by me in the first paragraph in the words of the "recellt positivist," R. Avenarius, and in the second, in the words of the subjective idealist, J. G. Fichte.* The sophistry of this theory is so manifest that it is embarrassing to analyse it. If we "mentally project" ourselves, our presence will be <I>imag-</I>

<I>inary</I> -- but the existence of the earth prior to man is <I>real</I>. Man <I>could not</I> in practice be an observer, for instance, of the earth in an incandescent state, and to "imagine" his being present at the time is <I>obscurantism</I>, exactly as though I were to endeavour to prove the existence of hell by the argument that if I "mentally projected" myself thither as an observer I could observe hell. The "reconciliation" of empirio-criticism and natural science amounts to this, that Avenarius graciously consents to "mentally project" something the possibility of admitting which is <I>excluded</I> by natural science. No man at all educated or sound-minded doubts that the earth existed at a time when there <I>could not</I> have been any life on it, any sensation or any "central term," and consequently the whole theory of Mach and Avenarius, from which it follows that the earth is a complex of sensations ("bodies are complexes of sensations") or "complexes of elements in which the psychical and physical are identical," or "a counter-term of which the central term can never be equal to zero," is <I>philosophical obscurantism</I>, the carrying of subjective idealism to absurdity. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   J. Petzoldt perceived the absurdity of the position into which Avenarius had fallen and felt ashamed. In his <I>Introduction to the Philosophy of Pure Experience</I> (Vol. II) he devotes a whole paragraph (&#167; 65) "to the question of the reality of earlier (<I>fr&uumlhere </I>) periods of the earth." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "In the teaching of Avenarius," says Petzoldt, "the <I>self</I> (<I>das Ich </I>) plays a role different from that which it plays with Schuppe [let us note that Petzoldt openly and repeatedly declares: our philosophy was founded by <I>three</I> men -- Avenarius, Mach and Schuppe], yet it is a role which, perhaps, possesses too much importance for his theory." (Petzoldt was evidently influenced by the fact that Schuppe had unmasked Avenarius by showing that with him too everything rests 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 80</B></FONT><P>

entirely on the <I>self </I>; and Petzoldt wishes to make a correction.) "Avenarius said on one occasion," Petzoldt continues, "that we can think of a 'region' where no human foot has yet trodden, but to be able <I>to think</I> (italicised by Avenarius) of such an environment there is required what we designate by the term <I>self</I> (<I>Ich-Bezeichnetes </I>), <I>whose</I> (italicised by Avenarius) thought the thinking is (<I>V. f. wiss. Ph.</I>, 18. Bd., 1894, S. 146, Anm.)." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Petzoldt replies: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The epistemologically important question, however, is not whether we can think of such a region at all, but whether we are entitled to think of it as existing, or as having existed, independently of any individual mind." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Right is right! People can think and "mentally project" for themselves any kind of hell and any kind of hobgoblin. Lunacharsky even "mentally projected" for<A NAME="p80"> himself -- well, to use a mild expression -- religious conceptions.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en33">33</A>]</FONT> But it is precisely the purpose of the theory of knowledge to show the unreal, fantastic and reactionary character of such projections. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . For, that the system C [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the brain] is necessary for thought is obvious both for Avenarius and for the philosophy which is here presented. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is not true. Avenarius' theory of 1876 is a theory of thought without brain. And in his theory of 1891-94, as we shall presently see, there is a similar element of idealist nonsense. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . But is this system C <I>a condition of existence</I> [italicised by Petzoldt] of, say, the Mesozoic period (<I>Sekund&aumlrzeit </I>) of the earth?" And Petzoldt, presenting the argument of Avenarius I have already cited on the subject of what science 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 81</B></FONT><P>

actually wants and how we can "mentally project" the spectator, objects: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "No, we wish to know whether I have the right to think that the earth at that remote epoch existed in the same way as I think of it as having existed yesterday or a minute ago. Or must the existence of the earth be really made conditional, as <I>Willy</I> claimed, on our right at least to assume that at the given period there co-existed some system C, even though at the lowest stage of its development?" Of this idea of Willy's we shall speak presently. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Avenarius evades Willy's strange conclusion by the argument that the person who puts the question cannot mentally remove himself (<I>sich wegdenken</I>, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., think himself as absent), nor can he avoid mentally projecting himself (<I>sich hinzuzudenken</I>, see Avenarius, <I>The Human Concept of the World</I>, 1st Germ. ed., p. 130). But then Avenarius makes the individual <I>self</I> of the person who puts the question, or the thought of such a <I>self</I>, the condition not only of the act of thought regarding the uninhabitable earth, but also of the justification for believing in the existence of the earth at that time. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "These false paths are easily avoided if we do not ascribe so much theoretical importance to the <I>self</I>. The only thing the theory of knowledge should demand of the various conceptions of that which is remote in space or time is that it be conceivable and uniquely (<I>eindeutig </I>) determined, the rest is the affair of the special sciences" (Vol. II, p. 325). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Petzoldt rechristened the law of causality the law of unique determination and imported into his theory, as we shall see later, the apriority of this law. This means that Petzoldt saves himself from Avenarius' subjective idealism and solipsism ("he attributes an exaggerated importance to 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 82</B></FONT><P>

the <I>self</I>," as the professorial jargon has it) with the help of <I>Kantian</I> ideas. The absence of the objective factor in Avenarius' doctrine, the impossibility of reconciling it with the demands of natural science, which declares the earth (object) to have existed long before the appearance of living beings (subject), compelled Petzoldt to resort to causality (unique determination). The earth existed, for its existence prior to man is causally connected with the present<A NAME="p82"> existence of the earth. Firstly, where does causality come from? <I>A priori</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en34">34</A>]</FONT> says Petzoldt. Secondly, are not the ideas of hell, devils, and Lunacharsky's "mental projections" also connected by causality? Thirdly, the theory of the "complexes of sensations" in any case turns out to be destroyed by Petzoldt. Petzoldt failed to resolve the contradiction he observed in Avenarius, and only entangled himself still more, for only one solution is possible, <I>viz</I>., the recognition that the external world reflected by our mind exists independ ently of our mind. This materialist solution alone is really compatible with natural science, and it alone eliminates both Petzoldt's and Mach's idealist solution of the question of causality, which we shall speak of separately. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The third empirio-criticist, R. Willy, first raised the question of this difficulty in Avenarius' philosophy in 1896, in an article entitled "<I>Der Empiriokritizismus als einzig wissenschaftlicher Standpunkt </I>" ("Empirio-Criticism as the Only Scientific Standpoint"). What about the world prior to man?  -- Willy asks here,* and at first answers according to Avenarius: "we project ourselves <I>mentally</I> into the past."

to regard experience as human <I>experience</I>. "For we must simply regard the animal kingdom -- be it the most insignificant worm -- as primitive fellow-men (<I>Mitmenschen </I>) if we regard animal life in connection with general experience" (pp. 73-74). Thus, prior to man the earth was the "experience" of a worm, which discharged the functions of the "central term" in order to save Avenarius' "co-ordination" and Avenarius' philosophy! No wonder Petzoldt tried to dissociate himself from an argument which is not only the height of absurdity (ideas of the earth corresponding to the theories of the geologists attributed to a worm), but which does not in any way help our philosopher, for the earth existed not only before man but before any living being generally. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Willy returned to the question in 1905. The worm was now removed.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp83">*</A>]</FONT> But Petzoldt's "law of unique determination" could not, of course, satisfy Willy, who regarded it merely as "logical formalism." The author says -- will not the question of the world prior to man, as Petzoldt puts it, lead us "back again to the things-in-themselves of common sense"? (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., to materialism! How terrible indeed!). What does millions of years without life mean? "Is time perhaps a thing-in-itself? Of course not!** And that means that things outside men are only impressions, bits of fantasy fabricated by men with the help of a few fragments we find about us. And why not? Need the philosopher fear the stream of life? . . . And so I say to myself: abandon all this love of systems and grasp the moment (<I>ergreife den Augenblick </I>), the mo-

ment you are living in, the moment which alone brings happiness" (pp. 177-78). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Well, well! Either materialism or solipsism -- this, in spite of his vociferous phrases, is what Willy arrives at when he analyses the question of the existence of nature before man. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To summarise. Three augurs of empirio-criticism have appeared before us and have laboured in the sweat of their brow to reconcile their philosophy with natural science, to patch up the holes of solipsism. Avenarius repeated Fichte's argument and substituted an imaginary world for the real world. Petzoldt withdrew from Fichtean idealism and moved towards Kantian idealism. Willy, having suffered a fiasco with the "worm," threw up the sponge and inadvertently blurted out the truth: either materialism or solipsism, or even the recognition of nothing but the present moment. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It only remains for us to show the reader <I>how</I> this problem was understood and treated by our own native Machians. Here is Bazarov in the <I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism</I> (p. 11): 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It remains for us now,<A NAME="p84"> under the guidance of our faithful <I>vademecum </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en35">35</A>]</FONT> [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., Plekhanov], to descend into the last and most horrible circle of the solipsist inferno, into that circle where, as Plekhanov assures us, every subjective idealism is menaced with the necessity of conceiving the world as it was contemplated by the ichthyosauruses and archaeopteryxes. 'Let us mentally transport ourselves,' writes Plekhanov, 'to that epoch when only very remote ancestors of man existed on the earth, for instance, to the Mesozoic period. The question arises, what was the status of space, time and causality then? Whose subjective forms were they then? Were they the subjective forms of the ichthyosauruses? And whose intelligence at that time dictated 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 85</B></FONT><P>

its laws to nature? The intelligence of the archaeopteryx? To these queries the Kantian philosophy can give no answer. And it must be rejected as absolutely incompatible with modern science' (<I>L</I>. <I>Feuerbach</I>, p. 117)." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here Bazarov breaks the quotation from Plekhanov just before a very important passage -- as we shall soon see -- namely: "Idealism says that without subject there is no object. The history of the earth shows that the object existed long before the subject appeared, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., long before the appearance of organisms possessing a perceptible degree of consciousness. . . . The history of development reveals the truth of materialism." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We continue the quotation from Bazarov: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . But does Plekhanov's thing-in-itself provide the desired solution? Let us remember that even according to Plekhanov we can have no idea of things as they are in themselves; we know only their manifestations, only the results of their action on our sense-organs. 'Apart from this action they possess no aspect' (<I>L</I>. <I>Feuerbach</I>, p. 112). What sense-organs existed in the period of the ichthyosauruses? Evidently, only the sense-organs of the ichthyosauruses and their like. Only the ideas of the ichthyosauruses were then the actual, the real manifestations of things-in-themselves. Hence, according to Plekhanov also, if the paleontologist desires to remain on 'real' ground he must write the story of the Mesozoic period in the light of the contemplations of the ichthyosaurus. And, consequently, not a single step forward is made in comparison with solipsism." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such is the complete argument (the reader must pardon the lengthy quotation -- we could not avoid it) of a Machian, an argument worthy of perpetuation as a first-class example of muddleheadedness. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 86</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Bazarov imagines that Plekhanov gave himself away. If things-in-themselves, apart from their action on our sense organs, have no aspect of their own, then in the Mesozoic period they did not exist except as the "aspect" of the sense organs of the ichthyosaurus. And this is the argument of a materialist! If an "aspect" is the result of the action of "things-in-themselves" on sense-organs -- does it follow that things <I>do not exist independently</I> of sense-organs of one kind or another?? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us assume for a moment that Bazarov indeed "misunderstood" Plekhanov's words (improbable as such an assumption may seem), that they did appear obscure to him. Be it so. We ask: is Bazarov engaged in a fencing bout with Plekhanov (whom the Machians exalt to the position of the only representative of materialism!), or is he endeavouring to clear up the problem of <I>materialism </I>? If Plekhanov seemed obscure to you, or contradictory, and so forth, why did you not turn to other materialists? Is it because you do not know them? But ignorance is no argument. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If Bazarov indeed does not know that the fundamental premise of materialism is the recognition of the external world, of the existence of <I>things</I> outside and independent of our mind, this is truly a striking case of crass ignorance. We would remind the reader of Berkeley, who in 1710 rebuked the materialists for their recognition of "objects in themselves" existing independently of our mind and reflected by our mind. Of course, everybody is free to side with Berkeley or anyone else <I>against</I> the materialists; that is unquestionable. But it is equally unquestionable that to speak of the materialists and distort or ignore the fundamental premise of <I>all</I> materialism is to import preposterous confusion into the problem. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 87</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Was Plekhanov right when he said that for idealism there is no object without a subject, while for materialism the object exists independently of the subject and is reflected more or less adequately in the subject's mind? If this is <I>wrong</I>, then any man who has the slightest respect for Marxism should have pointed out <I>this</I> error of Plekhanov's, and should have dealt <I>not</I> with him, but with someone else, with Marx, Engels, or Feuerbach, on the question of materialism and the existence of nature prior to man. But if this is right, or, at least, if you are unable to find an error here, then your attempt to shuffle the cards and to confuse in the reader's mind the most elementary conception of materialism, as distinguished from idealism, is a literary indecency. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As for the Marxists who are interested in the question <I>apart</I> from every little word uttered by Plekhanov, we shall quote the opinion of L. Feuerbach, who, as is known (perhaps not to Bazarov?), was a materialist, and through whom Marx and Engels, as is well known, came from the idealism of Hegel to their materialist philosophy. In his rejoinder to R. Haym, Feuerbach wrote: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Nature, which is not an object of man or mind, is for speculative philosophy, or at least for idealism, a Kantian thing-in-itself [we shall speak later in detail of the fact that our Machians confuse the Kantian thing-in-itself with the materialist thing-in-itself], an abstraction without reality, but it is nature that causes the downfall of idealism. Natural science, at least in its present state, necessarily leads us back to a point when the conditions for human existence were still absent, when nature, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the earth, was not yet an object of the human eye and mind, when, consequently, nature was an absolutely non-human entity (<I>absolut unmenschliches Wesen </I>). Idealism may retort: but nature also is something thought of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 88</B></FONT><P>

by you (<I>von dir gedachte </I>). Certainly, but from this it does not follow that this nature did not at one time actually exist, just as from the fact that Socrates and Plato do not exist for me if I do not think of them, it does not follow that Socrates and Plato did not actually at one time exist without me."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp88">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This is how Feuerbach regarded materialism and idealism from the standpoint of the existence of nature prior to the appearance of man. Avenarius' sophistry (the "mental projection of the observer") was refuted by Feuerbach, who did not know the "recent positivism" but who thoroughly knew the old idealist sophistries. And Bazarov offers us absolutely nothing new, but merely repeats this sophistry of the idealists: "Had I been there [on earth, prior to man], I would have seen the world so-and-so" (<I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism</I>, p. 29). In other words: if I make an assumption that is obviously absurd and contrary to natural science (that man can be an observer in an epoch before man existed), I shall be able to patch up the breach in my philosophy! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This gives us an idea of the extent of Bazarov's knowledge of the subject and of his literary methods. Bazarov did not even hint at the "difficulty" with which Avenarius, Petzoldt and Willy wrestled; and, moreover, he made such a hash of the whole subject, placed before the reader such an incredible hotchpotch, that there ultimately appears to be no difference between materialism and solipsism! Idealism is represented as "realism," and to materialism is ascribed the denial of the existence of things outside of their action

on the sense-organs! Truly, either Feuerbach did not know the elementary difference between materialism and idealism, or else Bazarov and Co. have completely altered the elementary truths of philosophy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Or let us take Valentinov, a philosopher who, naturally, is delighted with Bazarov: 1) "Berkeley is the founder of the correlativist theory of the relativity of subject and object" (p. 148). This is not Berkeleian idealism, oh, no! This is a "profound analysis." 2) "In the most realistic aspect, irrespective of the forms [!] of their usual idealist interpretation [only interpretation!], the fundamental premises of the theory are formulated by Avenarius" (p. 148). Infants, as we see, are taken in by the mystification! 3) "Avenarius' conception of the starting point of knowledge is that each individual finds himself in a definite environment, in other words, the individual and the environment are represented as connected and inseparable [!] terms of one and the same co-ordination" (p. 148). Delightful! This is not idealism -- Bazarov and Valentinov have risen above materialism and idealism -- this "inseparability" of the subject and object is "realism" itself. 4) "Is the reverse assertion correct, namely, that there is no counter-term to which there is no corresponding central term -- an individual? Naturally [!] not. . . . In the Archean period the woods were verdant . . . yet there was no man" (p. 143). That means that the inseparable <I>can</I> be separated! Is that not "natural"? 5) "Yet from the standpoint of the theory of knowledge, the question of the object in itself is absurd" (p. 148). Of course! When there were no sentient organisms objects were nevertheless "complexes of elements" <I>identical</I> with sensations! 6) "The immanentist school, in the person of Schubert-Soldern and Schuppe, clad these [!] thoughts in an unsatisfactory form and found itself in the <I>cul-de-sac</I> of solips-
 
<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 90</B></FONT><P>

ism" (p. 149). But "these thoughts" themselves, of course, contain no solipsism, and empirio-criticism, of course, is not a paraphrase of the reactionary theories of the immanentists, who lie when they declare themselves to be in sympathy with Avenarius! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This, Messrs. Machians, is not philosophy, but an incoherent jumble of words.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Bazarov emphatically answers this question in the affirmative. He writes: "If Plekhanov's thesis that 'consciousness is an internal [? Bazarov] state of matter' be given a more satisfactory form, <I>e</I>.<I>g</I>., that 'every mental process is a function of the cerebral process,' then neither Mach nor Avenarius would dispute it" (<I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism</I>, p. 29). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  To the mouse no beast is stronger than the cat. To the Russian Machians there is no materialist stronger than Plekhanov. Was Plekhanov really the only one, or the first, to advance the materialist thesis that consciousness is an internal state of matter? And if Bazarov did not like Plekhanov's formulation of materialism, why did he take Plekhanov and not Engels or Feuerbach? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Because the Machians are afraid to admit the truth. They are fighting materialism, but pretend that it is only Plekhanov they are fighting. A cowardly and unprincipled method. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But let us turn to empirio-criticism. Avenarius "would not dispute" the statement that thought is a function of the brain. These words of Bazarov's contain a direct untruth. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 91</B></FONT><P>

Not only does Avenarius <I>dispute</I> the materialist thesis, but invents a whole "theory" in order to refute it. "The brain," says Avenarius in <I>The Human Concept of the World</I>, "is not the habitation, the seat, the creator, it is not the instrument or organ, the supporter or substratum, etc., of thought" (p. 76 --  approvingly quoted by Mach in the <I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 32). "Thought is not an indweller, or commander, or the other half, or side, etc., nor is it a product or even a physiological function, or a state in general of the brain" (<I>ibid</I>.). And Avenarius expresses himself no less emphatically in his <I>Notes </I>: "presentations" are "not functions (physiological, psychical, or psycho-physical) of the brain" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., &#167; 115, p. 419). Sensations are not "psychical functions of the brain" (&#167; 116). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus, according to Avenarius, the brain is not the organ of thought, and thought is not a function of the brain. Take Engels, and we immediately find directly contrary, frankly materialist formulations. "Thought and consciousness,"<A NAME="p91"> says Engels in <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, "are products of the human brain" (5th Germ. ed., p. 22).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en36">36</A>]</FONT> This idea is often repeated in that work. In <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I> we have the following exposition of the views of Feuerbach and Engels: ". . . the material (<I>stofflich </I>), sensuously perceptible world to which we ourselves belong is the only reality," "our consciousness and thinking, however suprasensuous they may seem, are the product (<I>Erzeugnis </I>) of a material, bodily organ, the brain. Matter is not a product of mind, but mind itself is merely the highest product of matter. This is, of course, pure materialism" (4th Germ. ed., p. 18). Or on p. 4, where he speaks of the reflection<A NAME="p91a"> of the processes of nature in "the thinking brain,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en37">37</A>]</FONT> etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Avenarius rejects this materialist standpoint and says that "the thinking brain" is a "<I>fetish of natural science </I>" (<I>The</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 92</B></FONT><P>

<I>Human Concept of the World</I>, 2nd Germ. ed., p. 70). Hence, Avenarius cherishes no illusions concerning his absolute disagreement with natural science on this point. He admits, as do Mach and all the immanentists, that natural science holds an instinctive and unconscious materialist point of view. He admits and explicitly declares that <I>he absolutely differs from the</I> "<I>prevailing psychology</I>" (<I>Notes</I>, p. 150, etc.). This prevailing psychology is guilty of an inadmissible "introjection" -- such is the new term contrived by our philosopher -- <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the insertion of thought into the brain, or of sensations into us. These "two words" (into us -- <I>in uns </I>), Avenarius goes on to say, contain the assumption (<I>Annahme </I>) that empirio-criticism disputes. "This insertion (<I>Hineinverlegung </I>) of the visible, etc., into man is what we call <I>introjection </I>" (&#167; 45, p. 153).
 
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Introjection deviates "in principle" from the "natural conception of the world" (<I>nat&uumlrlicher Weltbegriff </I>) by substituting "in me" for "before me" (<I>vor mir</I>, p. 154) "by turning a component part of the (real) environment into a component part of (ideal) thought" (<I>ibid</I>.). "Out of the <I>amechanical</I> [a new word in place of "mental"] which manifests itself freely and clearly in the experienced [or, in what is found -- <I>im Vorgefundenen </I>], introjection makes something which hides itself [<I>Latitierendes</I>, says Avenarius -- another new word] mysteriously in the central nervous system" (<I>ibid</I>.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here we have the same <I>mystification</I> that we encountered in the famous defence of "na&iumlve realism" by the empirio-criticists and immanentists. Avenarius<A NAME="p92"> here acts on the advice of the charlatan in Turgenev:<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en38">38</A>]</FONT> denounce most of all those vices which you yourself possess. Avenarius tries to pretend that he is combating idealism: philosophical idealism, you see, is usually deduced from introjection, the exter-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 93</B></FONT><P>

nal world is converted into sensation, into idea, and so forth, while I defend "na&iumlve realism," the equal reality of everything presented, both "<I>self </I>" and environment, without inserting the external world into the human brain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The sophistry here is the same as that which we observed in the case of the famous co-ordination. While distracting the attention of the reader by attacking idealism, Avenarius is in fact defending idealism, albeit in slightly different words: thought is not a function of the brain; the brain is not the organ of thought; sensations are not a function of the nervous system, oh, no! sensations are -- "elements," psychical only in one connection, while in another connection (although the elements are "<I>identical </I>") they are physical. With his new and muddled terminology, with his new and pompous epithets, supposedly expressing a new "theory," Avenarius merely beat about the bush and returned to his fundamental idealist premise. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And if our Russian Machians (<I>e</I>.<I>g</I>., Bogdanov) failed to notice the "mystification" and discerned a refutation of idealism in the "new" defence of idealism, in the analysis of empirio-criticism given by the professional philosophers we find a sober estimate of the true nature of Avenarius' ideas, which is laid bare when stripped of its pretentious terminology. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In 1903 Bogdanov wrote ("Authoritative Thinking," an article in the symposium <I>From the Psychology of Society</I>, p. 119, <I>et seq</I>.): 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Richard Avenarius presented a most harmonious and complete philosophical picture of the development of the dualism of spirit and body. The gist of his 'doctrine of introjection' is the following: [we observe only physical bodies directly, and we infer the experiences of others, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the mind of another person, only by hypothesis]. . . . The 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 94</B></FONT><P>

hypothesis is complicated by the fact that the experiences of the other person are assumed to be located in his body, are inserted (introjected) into his organism. This is already a superfluous hypothesis and even gives rise to numerous contradictions. Avenarius systematically draws attention to these contradictions by unfolding a series of successive historical facts in the development of dualism and of philosophical idealism. But here we need not follow Avenarius.". . . "Introjection serves as an explanation of the dualism of mind and body." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov swallowed the bait of professorial philosophy in believing that "introjection" was aimed against idealism. He accepted the evaluation of introjection given by Avenarius himself <I>at its face value</I> and failed to notice the <I>barb</I> directed against materialism. Introjection denies that thought is a function of the brain, that sensations are a function of man's central nervous system: that is, it denies thc- most elementary truth of physiology in order to destroy materialism. "Dualism," it appears, is refuted <I>idealistically</I> (notwithstanding all Avenarius' diplomatic rage against idealism), for sensation and thought prove to be not secondary, not a product of matter, but <I>primary</I>. Dualism is here refuted by Avenarius only in so far as he "refutes" the existence of the object without the subject, matter without thought, the external world independent of our sensations; that is, it is refuted <I>idealistically</I>. The absurd denial of the fact that the visual image of a tree is a function of the retina, the nerves and the brain, was required by Avenarius in order to bolster up his theory of the "indissoluble" connection of the "complete" experience, which includes not only the self but also the tree, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the environment. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 95</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The doctrine of introjection is a muddle, it smuggles in idealistic rubbish and is contradictory to natural science, which inflexibly holds that thought is a function of the brain, that sensations, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the images of the <I>external world</I>, exist <I>within us</I>, produced by the action of things on our sense-organs. The materialist elimination of the "dualism of mind and body" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialist monism) consists in the assertion that the mind does not exist independently of the body, that mind is secondary, a function of the brain, a reflection of the external world. The idealist elimination of the "dualism of mind and body" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., idealist monism) consists in the assertion that mind <I>is not</I> a function of the body, that, consequently, mind is primary, that the "environment" and the "self" exist only in an inseparable connection of one and the same "complexes of elements." Apart from these two diametrically opposed methods of eliminating "the dualism of mind and body," there can be no third method, unless it be eclecticism, which is a senseless jumble of materialism and idealism. And it was this jumble of Avenarius' that seemed to Bogdanov and Co. "the truth transcending materialism and idealism." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But the professional philosophers are not as na&iumlve and credulous as are the Russian Machians. True, each of these professors-in-ordinary advocates his "<I>own </I>" system of refuting materialism, or, at any rate, of "reconciling" materialism and idealism. But when it comes to a competitor they unceremoniously expose the unconnected fragments of materialism and idealism that are contained in all the "recent" and "original" systems. And if a few young intellectuals swallowed Avenarius' bait, that old bird Wundt was not to be enticed so easily. The idealist Wundt tore the mask from the poseur Avenarius very unceremoniously <I>when he praised</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 96</B></FONT><P>

<I>him for the anti-materialist tendency of the theory of introjection</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "If empirio-criticism," Wundt wrote, "reproaches vulgar materialism because by such expressions as the brain 'has' thought, or the brain 'produces' thought, it expresses a relation which generally cannot be established by factual observation and description [evidently, for Wundt it is a "fact" that a person thinks without the help of a brain!]. . . this reproach, of course, is well founded" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 47-48). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Well, of course! The idealists will always join the half-hearted Avenarius and Mach in attacking materialism! It is only a pity, Wundt goes on to say, that this theory of introjection "does not stand in any relation to the doctrine of the independent vital series, and was, to all appearances, only tacked on to it as an afterthought and in a rather artificial fashion" (p. 365). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Introjection, says O. Ewald, "is to be regarded as nothing but a fiction of empirio-criticism, which the latter requires in order to shield its own fallacies" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 44). "We observe a strange contradiction: on the one hand, the elimination of introjection and the restoration of the natural world conception is intended to restore to the world the character of living reality; on the other hand, in the principal co-ordination empirio-criticism is leading to a purely idealist theory of an absolute correlation of the counter-term and the central term. Avenarius is thus moving in a circle. He set out to do battle against idealism but laid down his arms before it came to an open skirmish. He wanted to liberate the world of objects from the yoke of the subject, but again bound that world to the subject. What he has actually destroyed by his criticism is a caricature of idealism rather than its genuine epistemological expression" (<I>ibid</I>., pp. 64-65). 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 97</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "In his [Avenarius'] frequently quoted statement," Norman Smith says, "that the brain is not the seat, organ or supporter of thought, he rejects the only terms which we possess for defining their connection" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 30). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Nor is it surprising that the theory of introjection approved by Wundt excites the sympathy of the outspoken spiritualist, James Ward,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp97">*</A>]</FONT> who wages systematic war on "naturalism and agnosticism, and especially on Thomas Huxley (not because he was an insufficiently outspoken and determined materialist, for which Engels reproached him, but) because his agnosticism served in fact to conceal materialism.

    Let us note that Karl Pearson, the English Machian, who avoid all philosophical artifices, and who recognises neither introjection, nor co-ordination, nor yet "the discovery of the world-elements," arrives at the inevitable outcome of Machism when it is stripped of such "disguises," namely, pure subjective idealism. Pearson knows no "elements"; "sense impressions" are his alpha and omega. He never doubts that man thinks with the help of the brain. And the contradiction between this thesis (which alone conforms with science) and the basis of his philosophy remains naked and obvious. Pearson spares no effort in combating the concept that matter exists <I>independently</I> of our sense-impressions (<I>The Grammar of Science</I>, Chap VII). Repeating all Berkeley's arguments, Pearson declare that matter is a nonentity. But when he comes to speak of the relation of the brain to thought, Pearson emphatically declares: "From will and consciousness associated with material machinery we can infer nothing whatever as to will

and consciousness without that machinery."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp98">*</A>]</FONT> He even advances the following thesis as a summary of his investigations in this field: "Consciousness has no meaning beyond nervous systems akin to our own; it is illogical to assert that all matter is conscious [but it is logical to assert that all matter possesses a property which is essentially akin to sensation, the property of reflection], still more that consciousness or will can exist outside matter" (<I>ibid</I>., p. 75, 2nd thesis). Pearson's muddle is glaring! Matter is nothing but groups of sense impressions. That is his premise, that is his philosophy. Hence, sensation and thought should be primary; matter, secondary. But no, consciousness without matter does not exist, and apparently not even without a nervous system! That is, consciousness and sensation are secondary. The waters rest on the earth, the earth rests on a whale, and the whale rests on the waters. Mach's "elements" and Avenarius' co-ordination and introjection do not clear up this muddle, all they do is to obscure the matter, to cover up traces with the help of an erudite philosophical gibberish. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Just such gibberish, and of this a word or two will suffice, is the special terminology of Avenarius, who coined a plenitude of diverse "notals," "securals," "fidentials," etc., etc. Our Russian Machians for the most part shamefacedly avoid this professorial rigmarole, and only now and again bombard the reader (in order to stun him) with an "existential" and such like. But if na&iumlve people take these words for a species of bio-mechanics, the German philosophers, who are themselves lovers of "erudite" words, laugh at Avenarius. To say "notal" (<I>notus</I> = known), or to say that this or the other thing is known to me, is absolutely one and the same, says

Wundt in the section entitled "Scholastic Character of the Empirio-Critical System." And, indeed, it is the purest and most dreary scholasticism. One of Avenarius' most faithful disciples, R. Willy, had the courage to admit it frankly. "Avenarius dreamed of a bio-mechanics," says he, "but an understanding of the life of the brain can be arrived at only by actual discoveries, and not by the way in which Avenarius attempted to arrive at it. Avenarius' bio-mechanics is not grounded on any new observations whatever; its characteristic feature is purely schematic constructions of concepts, and, indeed, constructions that do not even bear the nature of hypotheses that open up new vistas, but rather of stereotyped speculations (<I>blosse Spekulierschablonen </I>), which, like a wall, conceal our view."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp99">*</A>]</FONT>

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have seen that the starting point and the fundamental premise of the philosophy of empirio-criticism is subjective idealism. The world is our sensation -- this is the fundamen tal premise, which is obscured but in nowise altered by the word "element" and by the theories of the "independent series," "co-ordination," and "introjection." The absurdity

of this philosophy lies in the fact that it leads to solipsism, to the recognition of the existence of the philosophising individual only. But our Russian Machians assure their readers that to "charge" Mach "with idealism and even solipsism" is "extreme subjectivism." So says Bogdanov in the introduction to the Russian translation of <I>Analysis of Sensations</I> (p. xi), and the whole Machian troop repeat it in a great variety of keys. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Having examined the methods whereby Mach and Avenarius disguise their solipsism, we have now to add only one thing: the "extreme subjectivism" of assertion lies entirely with Bogdanov and Co.; for in philosophical literature writers of the most varied trends have long since disclosed the fundamental sin of Machism beneath all its disguises. We shall confine ourselves to a mere <I>summary</I> of opinions which sufficiently indicate the "subjective" <I>ignorance</I> of our Machians. Let us note in passing that nearly every professional philosopher sympathises with one or another brand of idealism: in their eyes idealism is not a reproach, as it is with us Marxists; but they point out Mach's <I>actual</I> philosophical trend and oppose one system of idealism by another system, also idealist, but to them more consistent.

Jerusalem, a most reactionary Kantian with whom Mach in the above-mentioned preface expresses his solidar ity ("a closer kinship" of thought than Mach had previously suspected -- <I>Vorwort zu "Erkenntnis und Irrtum</I>," S. x, 1906) says: "Consistent phenomenalism leads to solipsism." And therefore one must borrow a little from Kant! (See <I>Der kritische Idealismus und die reine Logik</I> [<I>Critical Idealism and Pure Logic </I>], 1905, S. 26.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   R. H&oumlnigswald says: ". . . the immanentists and the empirio-criticists face the alternative of solipsism or metaphysics in the spirit of Fichte, Schelling, or Hegel" (<I>Ueber die Lehre Hume's von der Realit&aumlt der Aussendinge</I> [<I>Hume's Doctrine of the Reality of the External World </I>], 1904, S. 68). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The English physicist Oliver Lodge, in his book denouncing the materialist Haeckel, speaks in passing, as though of something generally known, of "solipsists such as Mach and Karl Pearson" (Sir Oliver Lodge, <I>La vie et la mati&egravere</I> [<I>Life and Matter </I>], Paris, 1907, p. 15).

   <I>Nature</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en43">43</A>]</FONT> the organ of the English scientists, through the mouth of the geometrician E. T. Dixon, pronounced a very definite opinion of the Machian Pearson, one worth quoting, not because it is new, but because the Russian Machians have na&iumlvely accepted Mach's philosophical muddle as the "philosophy of natural science" (A. Bogdanov, introduction to <I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. xii, <I>et seq</I>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 102</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "The foundation of the whole book," Dixon wrote, "is the proposition that since we cannot directly apprehend anything but sense-impressions, therefore the things we commonly speak of as objective, or external to ourselves, and their variations, are nothing but groups of sense-impressions and sequences of such groups. But Professor Pearson admits the existence of other consciousness than his own, not only by implication in addressing his book to them, but explicitly in many passages." Pearson infers the existence of the consciousness of others by analogy, by observing the bodily motions of other people; but since the consciousness of others is real, the existence of people outside myself must be granted! "Of course it would be impossible thus to refute a consistent idealist, who maintained that not only external things but all other consciousness were unreal and existed only in his imagination, but to recognise the reality of other consciousness is to recognise the reality of the means by which we become aware of them, which . . . is the external aspect of men's bodies." The way out of the difficulty is to recognise the "hypothesis" that to our sense-impressions there corresponds an objective reality outside of us. This hypothesis satisfactorily explains our sense-impressions. "I cannot seriously doubt that Professor Pearson himself believes in them as much as anyone else. Only, if he were to acknowledge it explicitly, he would have to rewrite almost every page of <I>The Grammar of Science</I>."* 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Ridicule -- that is the response of the thinking scientists to the idealist philosophy over which Mach waxes so enthusiastic.

  And here, finally, is the opinion of a German physicist, L. Boltzmann. The Machians will perhaps say, as Friedrich Adler said, that he is a physicist of the old school. But we are concerned <I>now</I> not with theories of physics but with a fundamental philosophical problem. Writing against people who "have been carried away by the new epistemological dogmas," Boltzmann says: "Mistrust of conceptions which we can derive only from immediate sense-impressions has led to an extreme which is the direct opposite of former na&iumlve belief. Only sense-impressions are given us, and, therefore, it is said, we have no right to go a step beyond. But to be consistent, one must further ask: are our sense-impressions of yesterday also given? What is immediately given is only the one sense-impression, or only the one thought, namely, the one we are thinking at the present moment. Hence, to be consistent, one would have to deny not only the existence of other people outside one's <I>self</I>, but also all conceptions we ever had in the past."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp103">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This physicist rightly ridicules the supposedly "new" "phenomenalist" view of Mach and Co. as the old absurdity of philosophical subjective idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No, it is those who "failed to note" that solipsism is Mach's fundamental error who are stricken with "subjective" blindness.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Our Machians have written so much about the "thing-in itself" that were all their writings to be collected they would result in mountains of printed matter.<A NAME="p104"> The"thing-in-itself" is a veritable <I>b&ecircte noire</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en44">44</A>]</FONT> with Bogdanov and Valentinov, Bazarov and Chernov, Berman and Yushkevich. There is no abuse they have not hurled at it, there is no ridicule they have not showered on it. And against whom are they breaking lances because of this luckless "thing-in-itself"? Here a division of the philosophers of Russian Machism according to political parties begins. All the would-be Marxists among the Machians are combating <I>Plekhanov's</I> "thing-in-itself"; they accuse Plekhanov of having become entangled and straying into Kantianism, and of having forsaken Engels. (We shall discuss the first 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 105</B></FONT><P>

accusation in the fourth chapter; the second accusation we shall deal with now.) The Machian Mr. Victor Chernov, a Narodnik and a sworn enemy of Marxism, opens a direct campaign <I>against Engels</I> because of the "thing-in-itself." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One is ashamed to confess it, but it would be a sin to conceal the fact that on this occasion open enmity towards Marxism has made Mr. Victor Chernov a <I>more</I> principled<A NAME="p105"> literary antagonist than our comrades in party and opponents in philosophy.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en45">45</A>]</FONT> For only a <I>guilty conscience</I> (and in addition, perhaps, ignorance of materialism?) could have been responsible for the fact that the Machian would-be Marxists have diplomatically set Engels aside, have completely ignored Feuerbach and are circling exclusively around Plekhanov. It is indeed circling around one spot, tedious and petty pecking and cavilling at a disciple of Engels, while a frank examination of the views of the teacher himself is cravenly avoided. And since the purpose of these cursory comments is to disclose the reactionary character of Machism and the correctness of the materialism of Marx and Engels, we shall leave aside the fussing of the Machian would-be Marxists with Plekhanov and turn directly to Engels, whom the empirio-criticist Mr. V. Chernov refuted. In his <I>Philosophical and Sociological Studies</I> (Moscow, 1907 -- a collection of articles written, with few exceptions, before 1900) the article "Marxism and Transcendental Philosophy" bluntly begins with an attempt to set up Marx against Engels and accuses the latter of "na&iumlve dogmatic materialism," of "the crudest materialist dogmatism" (pp. 29 and 32). Mr. V. Chernov states that a "sufficient" example of this is Engels' argument against the Kantian thing-in itself and Hume's philosophical line. We shall begin with this argument. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 106</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In his <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>, Engels declares that the fundamental philosophical trends are materialism and idealism. Materialism regards nature as primary and spirit as secondary; it places being first and thought second. Idealism holds the contrary view. This root distinction between the "two great camps" into which the philosophers of the "various schools" of idealism and materialism are divided Engels takes as the cornerstone, and he directly charges with "confusion" those who use the terms idealism and materialism in any other way. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The great basic question of all philosophy," Engels says, "especially of modern philosophy, is that concerning the relation of thinking and being," of "spirit and nature." Having divided the philosophers into "two great camps" on this basic question, Engels shows that there is "yet another side" to this basic philosophical question, <I>viz</I>., "in what relation do our thoughts about the world surrounding us stand to this world itself? Is our thinking capable of the cognition of the real world? Are we able in our ideas and notions of the real world to produce a correct reflection of reality?* 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The overwhelming majority of philosophers give an affirmative answer to this question," says Engels, including under this head not only all materialists but also the most consistent idealists, as, for example, the absolute idealist Hegel, who considered the real world to be the realisation of some pre-

   "In addition [i.e., to the materialists and the consistent idealists] there is yet a set of different philosophers -- those who question the possibility of any cognition, or at least of an exhaustive cognition, of the world.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Mr. V. Chernov, quoting these words of Engels', launches into the fray. To the word "Kant" he makes the following annotation: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "In 1888 it was rather strange to term such philosophers as Kant and especially Hume as 'modern.' At that time it was more natural to hear mentioned such names as Cohen, Lange, Riehl, Laas, Liebmann, Goring, etc. But Engels, evidently, was not well versed in 'modern' philosophy" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 33, note 2).

authoritative (for Machism) and muddled professors whom Engels is refuting in his argument! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Having pointed out that Hegel had already presented the "decisive" arguments against Hume and Kant, and that the additions made by Feuerbach are more ingenious than profound, Engels continues: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The most telling refutation of this as of all other philosophical crotchets (<I>Schrullen </I>) is practice, namely, experiment and industry. If we are able to prove the correctness of our conception of a natural process by making it ourselves, bring ing it into being out of its conditions and making it serve our own purposes into the bargain, then there is an end to the Kantian incomprehensible [or ungraspable, <I>unfassbaren</I> -- this important word is omitted both in Plekhanov's translation and in Mr. V. Chernov's translation] 'thing-in-itself.' The chemical substances produced in the bodies of plants and animals remained just such 'things-in-themselves' until organic chemistry began to produce them one after another, where upon the 'thing-in-itself' became a 'thing for us,' as, for instance, alizarin, the colouring matter of the madder, which we no longer trouble to grow in the madder roots in the field,<A NAME="p108"> but produce much more cheaply and simply from coal tar" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 16).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en48">48</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Mr. V. Chernov, quoting this argument, finally loses patience and completely annihilates poor Engels. Listen to this: "No Neo-Kantian will of course be surprised that from coal tar we can produce alizarin 'more cheaply and simply.' But that together with alizarin it is possible to produce from this coal tar and just as cheaply a refutation of the 'thing-in-itself' will indeed seem a wonderful and unprecedented discovery -- and not to the Neo-Kantians alone. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 109</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "Engels, apparently, having learned that according to Kant the 'thing-in-itself' is unknowable, turned this theorem into its converse and concluded that everything unknown is a thing-in-itself" (p. 33). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Listen, Mr. Machian: lie, but don't overdo it! Why, be fore the very eyes of the public you are misrepresenting the very quotation from Engels you have set out to "tear to pieces," without even having grasped the point under discussion! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the first place, it is not true that Engels "is producing a refutation of the thing-in-itself." Engels said explicitly and clearly that he was refuting the <I>Kantian ungraspable</I> (or unknowable) thing-in-itself. Mr. Chernov confuses Engels' materialist conception of the existence of things independently of our consciousness. In the second place, if Kant's theorem reads that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, the "<I>converse </I>" theorem would be: the <I>unknowable</I> is the thing in-itself. Mr. Chernov <I>replaces</I> the unknowable by the <I>unknown</I>, without realising that by such a substitution he has again confused and distorted the materialist view of Engels! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Mr. V. Chernov is so bewildered by the reactionaries of official philosophy whom he has taken as his mentors that he raises an outcry against Engels <I>without in the least comprehending</I> the meaning of the example quoted. Let us try to explain to this representative of Machism what it is all about. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Engels clearly and explicitly states that he is contesting both Hume and Kant. Yet there is no mention whatever in Hume of "unknowable things-in-themselves." What then is there in common between these two philosophers? It is that they both <I>in principle fence off</I> "the appearance" from that which appears, the perception from that which is perceived the thing-for-us from the "thing-in-itself." Furthermore, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 110</B></FONT><P>

Hume does not want to hear of the "thing-in-itself," he regards the very thought of it as philosophically inadmissible, as "metaphysics" (as the Humeans and Kantians call it); whereas Kant grants the existence of the "thing-in-itself," but declares it to be "unknowable," fundamentally different from the appearance, belonging to a fundamentally different realm, the realm of the "beyond" (<I>Jenseits </I>), inaccessible to knowledge, but revealed to faith. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What is the kernel of Engels' objections? Yesterday we did not know that coal tar contained alizarin. Today we learned that it does. The question is, did coal tar contain alizarin yesterday? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Of course it did. To doubt it would be to make a mockery of modern science. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And if that is so, three important epistemological conclusions follow: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   1)&nbsp;Things exist independently of our consciousness, independently of our perceptions, outside of us, for it is beyond doubt that alizarin existed in coal tar yesterday and it is equally beyond doubt that yesterday we knew nothing of the existence of this alizarin and received no sensations from it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    2)&nbsp;There is definitely no difference in principle between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself, and there can be no such difference. The only difference is between what is known and what is not yet known. And philosophical inventions of specific boundaries between the one and the other, inventions to the effect that the thing-in-itself is "beyond" phenomena (Kant), or that we can and must fence ourselves off by some philosophical partition from the problem of a world which in one part or another is still unknown but which exists outside us (Hume) --<A NAME="p110"> all this is the sheerest nonsense, <I>Schrulle</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en49">49</A>]</FONT> crotchet, invention. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 111</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  3)&nbsp;In the theory of knowledge, as in every other branch of science, we must think dialectically, that is, we must not regard our knowledge as ready-made and unalterable, but must determine how <I>knowledge</I> emerges from <I>ignorance</I>, how incomplete, inexact knowledge becomes more complete and more exact. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Once we accept the point of view that human knowledge develops from ignorance, we shall find millions of examples of it just as simple as the discovery of alizarin in coal tar, millions of observations not only in the history of science and technology but in the everyday life of each and every one of us that illustrate the transformation of "things-in-themselves" into "things-for-us," the appearance of "phenomena" when our sense-organs experience an impact from external objects, the disappearance of "phenomena" when some obstacle prevents the action upon our sense-organs of an object which we know to exist. The sole and unavoidable deduction to be made from this -- a deduction which all of us make in everyday practice and which materialism deliberately places at the foundation of its epistemology -- is that outside us, and independently of us, there exist objects, things, bodies and that our perceptions are images of the external world. Mach's converse theory (that bodies are complexes of sensations) is nothing but pitiful idealist nonsense. And Mr. Chernov, in his "analysis" of Engels, once more revealed his Voroshilov qualities; Engels' simple example seemed to him "strange and na&iumlve"! He regards only <I>gelehrte</I> fiction as genuine philosophy and is unable to distinguish professorial eclecticism from the consistent materialist theory of knowledge. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is both impossible and unnecessary to analyse Mr. Chernov's other arguments; they all amount to the same pretentious rigmarole (like the assertion that for the materialists the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 112</B></FONT><P>

atom is the thing-in-itself!). We shall note only the argument which is relevant to our discussion (an argument which has apparently led certain people astray), <I>viz</I>., that Marx supposedly differed from Engels. The question at issue is Marx's <I>second</I><A NAME="p112"> Thesis on Feuerbach and Plekhanov's translation of the word <I>Diesseitigkeit</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en50">50</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
 Here is the second Thesis: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory, but is a practical question. In practice man must prove the truth, i.e., the reality and power, the 'this-sidedness' of his thinking. The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated<A NAME="p112a"> from practice is a purely scholastic question."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en51">51</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Instead of "prove the this-sidedness of thinking" (a literal translation), Plekhanov has: prove that thinking "does not stop at this side of phenomena." And Mr. V. Chernov cries: "The contradiction between Marx and Engels has been eliminated very simply. . . . It appears as though Marx, like Engels, asserted the knowability of things-in-themselves and the 'other-sidedness' of thinking" (<I>loc</I>. <I>cit</I>. p. 34, note). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What can be done with a Voroshilov whose every phrase makes confusion worse confoundedl It is sheer ignorance, Mr. Victor Chernov, not to know that all materialists assert the knowability of things-in-themselves. It is ignorance, Mr. Victor Chernov, or infinite slovenliness, to skip the <I>very first</I> phrase of the thesis and not to realise that the "objective truth" (<I>gegenst&aumlndliche Wahrheit </I>) of thinking means <I>nothing else</I> than the <I>existence</I> of objects (i.e., "things-in-themselves") <I>truly</I> reflected by thinking. It is sheer illiteracy Mr. Victor Chernov, to assert that from Plekhanov's paraphrase (Plekhanov gave a paraphrase and not a translation) "it appears as though" Marx defended the <I>other-sidedness</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 113</B></FONT><P>

of thought. Because only the Humeans and the Kantians confine thought to "this side of phenomena." But for all materialists, including those of the seventeenth century whom Bishop Berkeley demolished (see <A HREF="MEC08-old.html#intro">Introduction</A>), "phenomena" are "things-for-us" or <I>copies</I> of the "objects in themselves." Of course, Plekhanov's free paraphrase is not obligatory upon those who desire to know Marx himself, but it is obligatory to try to understand what Marx meant and not to prance about like a Voroshilov. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It is interesting to note that while among people who call themselves socialists we encounter an unwillingness or inability to grasp the meaning of Marx's "Theses," bourgeois writers, specialists in philosophy, sometimes manifest greater scrupulousness. I know of one such writer who studied the philosophy of Feuerbach and in connection with it Marx's "Theses." That writer is Albert L&eacutevy, who devoted the third chapter of the second part of his book on Feuerbach to an examination of the influence of Feuerbach on Marx.* Without going into the question whether L&eacutevy always interprets Feuerbach correctly, or how he criticises Marx from the ordinary bourgeois standpoint, we shall only quote his opinion of the philosophical content of Marx's famous "Theses." Regarding the first Thesis, L&eacutevy says: "Marx, on the one hand, together with all earlier materialism and with Feuerbach, recognises that there are real and distinct objects outside us corresponding to our ideas of things. . . ."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  As the reader sees, it was immediately clear to Albert Levy that the basic position not only of Marxist materialism but of every materialism, of "<I>all earlier </I>" materialism, is the recognition of real objects outside us, to which objects our ideas "correspond." This elementary truth, which holds good for all materialism in general, is unknown only to the Russian Machians. L&eacutevy continues: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . On the other hand, Marx expresses regret that materialism had left it to idealism to appreciate the importance of the active forces [i.e., human practice], which, according to Marx, must be wrested from idealism in order to integrate them into the materialist system. But it will of course be necessary to give these active forces the real and sensible character which idealism cannot grant them. Marx's idea, then, is the following: just as to our ideas there correspond real objects outside us, so to our phenomenal activity there corresponds a real activity outside us, an activity of things. In this sense humanity partakes of the absolute, not only through theoretical knowledge but also through practical activity; thus all human activity acquires a dignity, a nobility, that permits it to advance hand in hand with theory. Revolutionary activity henceforth acquires a metaphysical significance. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Albert L&eacutevy is a professor. And a proper professor must abuse the materialists as being metaphysicians. For the professorial idealists, Humeans and Kantians every kind of materialism is "metaphysics," because beyond the phenomenon (appearance, the thing-for-us) it discerns a reality outside us. A. L&eacutevy is therefore essentially right when he says that in Marx's opinion there corresponds to man's "phenomenal activity" "an activity of things," that is to say, human practice has not only a phenomenal (in the Humean 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 115</B></FONT><P>

and Kantian sense of the term), but an objectively real significance. The criterion of practice -- as we shall show in detail in its proper place (&#167; <A HREF="MEC08-old.html#c2s6">6</A>) -- has entirely different meanings for Mach and Marx. "Humanity partakes of the absolute" means that human knowledge reflects absolute truth (see below, &#167; <A HREF="MEC08-old.html#c2s5">5</A>); the practice of humanity, by verifying our ideas, corroborates what in those ideas corresponds to absolute truth. A. L&eacutevy continues: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . Having reached this point, Marx naturally encounters the objections of the critics. He has admitted the existence of things-in-themselves, of which our theory is the human translation. He cannot evade the usual objection: what assurance have you of the accuracy of the translation? What proof have you that the human mind gives you an objective truth? To this objection Marx replies in his second Thesis" (p. 291). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The reader sees that L&eacutevy does not for a moment doubt that Marx recognised the existence of things-in-themselves!

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  But while the Russian Machian would-be Marxists diplomatically evaded <I>one</I> of the most emphatic and explicit statements of Engels, they "revised" <I>another</I> statement of his in quite the Chernov manner. However tedious and laborious the task of correcting distortions and perversions of the meaning of quotations may be, he who wishes to speak of the Russian Machians cannot avoid it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is Bazarov's revision of Engels. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 116</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the article "On Historical Materialism,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp116">*</A>]</FONT> Engels speaks of the English agnostics (philosophers of Hume's trend of thought) as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    ". . . Our agnostic admits that all our knowledge is based upon the information (<I>Mitteilungen </I>) imparted to us by our senses. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Let us note for the benefit of our Machians that the agnostic (Humean) also starts from <I>sensations</I> and recognises no other source of knowledge. The agnostic is a pure "<I>positivist</I>," be it said for the benefit of the adherents of the "latest positivism!" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    ". . . But, he [the agnostic] adds, how do we know that our senses give us correct representations (<I>Abbilder</I>) of the objects we perceive through them? And he proceeds to in form us that, whenever he speaks of objects or their qualities, he does in reality not mean these objects and qualities, of which he cannot know anything for certain, but merely the impressions<A NAME="p116"> which they have produced on his senses. . . ."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en52">52</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    What two lines of philosophical tendency does Engels contrast here? One line is that the senses give us faithful images of things, that we know <I>the things themselves</I>, that the outer world acts on our sense-organs. This is materialism -- with which the agnostic is not in agreement. What then is the <I>essence</I> of the agnostic's line? It is that he <I>does not go beyond</I> sensations, that <I>he stops on this side of phenomena</I>, refusing to see anything "certain" beyond the

The only Russian translation, if I am not mistaken, is to be found in the symposium <I>Historical Materialism</I> p. 162, <I>et seq</I>. Bazarov quotes the passage in the <I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism</I>, p. 64. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 117</B></FONT><P>

boundary of sensations. About <I>these things themselves</I> (i.e., about the things-in-themselves, the "objects in themselves," as the materialists whom Berkeley opposed called them), we can know nothing certain -- so the agnostic categorically insists. Hence, in the controversy of which Engels speaks the materialist affirms the existence and knowability of things-in-themselves. The agnostic <I>does not even admit the thought</I> of things-in-themselves and insists that we can know nothing certain about them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It may be asked in what way the position of the agnostic as outlined by Engels differs from the position of Mach? In the "new" term "element"? But it is sheer childishness to believe that a nomenclature can change a philosophical line, that sensations when called "elements" cease to be sensations! Or does the difference lie in the "new" idea that the very same elements constitute the physical in one connection and the psychical in another? But did you not observe that Engels' agnostic <I>also</I> puts "impressions" in place of the "things themselves"? That means that <I>in essence</I> the agnostic too differentiates between physical and psychical "<I>impressions </I>"! Here again the difference is <I>exclusively</I> one of nomenclature. When Mach says that objects <I>are</I> complexes of sensations, Mach is a Berkeleian; when Mach "corrects" himself, and says that "elements" (sensations) can be physical in one connection and psychical in another, Mach is an agnostic, a Humean. Mach does not go beyond these two <I>lines</I> in his philosophy, and it requires extreme na&iumlvet&eacute to take this muddlehead at his word and believe that he has actually "transcended" both materialism and idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Engels deliberately mentions no names in his exposition, and criticises not individual representatives of Humism (professional philosophers are very prone to call original systems 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 118</B></FONT><P>

the petty variations one or another of them makes in terminology or argument), but <I>the whole</I> Humean line. Engels criticises not particulars but the essential thing; he examines the <I>fundamental</I> wherein <I>all</I> Humeans <I>deviate</I> from materialism, and his criticism therefore embraces Mill, Huxley and Mach alike. Whether we say (with J. S. Mill) that matter is the permanent possibility of sensation, or (with Ernst Mach) that matter is more or less stable complexes of "elements" -- sensations -- we remain <I>within the bounds</I> of agnosticism, or Humism. Both standpoints, or more correctly both formulations, are <I>covered</I> by Engels' exposition of agnosticism: the agnostic does not go beyond sensations and asserts that he <I>cannot</I> know anything certain about their source, about their original, etc. And if Mach attributes such great importance to his disagreement with Mill on this question, it is because Mach<A NAME="p118"> comes under Engels' characterisation of a professor-in-ordinary: <I>Flohknacker</I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en53">53</A>]</FONT> Ay, gentlemen, you have only cracked a flea by making petty corrections and by altering terminology instead of entirely abandoning the basic, half-hearted standpoint. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And how does the materialist Engels -- at the beginning of the article Engels explicitly and emphatically contrasts his materialism to agnosticism -- refute the foregoing arguments? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . Now, this line of reasoning seems undoubtedly hard to beat by mere argumentation. But before there was argumentation there was action. <I>Im Anfang war die That</I>. And human action had solved the difficulty long before human ingenuity invented it. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. From the moment we turn to our own use these objects, according to the qualities we perceive in them, we put to an infallible test the correctness or otherwise of our sense-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 119</B></FONT><P>

perceptions. If these perceptions have been wrong, then our estimate of the use to which an object can be turned must also be wrong, and our attempt must fail. But if we succeed in accomplishing our aim, if we find that the object does agree with our idea of it, and does answer the purpose we intended it for, then that is positive proof that our perceptions of it and of its qualities, so far, agree with reality outside ourselves. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus, the materialist theory, the theory of the reflection of objects by our mind, is here presented with absolute clarity: things exist outside us. Our perceptions and ideas are their images. Verification of these images, differentiation between true and false images, is given by practice. But let us listen to a little more of Engels (Bazarov at this point ends his quotation from Engels, or rather from Plekhanov, for he deems it unneccssary to deal with Engels himself): 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . And whenever we find ourselves face to face with a failure, then we generally are not long in making out the cause that made us fail; we find that the perception upon which we acted was either incomplete and superficial, or combined with the results of other perceptions in a way not warranted by them" (the Russian translation in <I>On Historical Materialism</I> is incorrect). "So long as we take care to train and to use our senses properly, and to keep our action within the limits prescribed by perceptions properly made and properly used, so long we shall find that the result of our action proves the conformity (<I>Uebereinstimmung </I>) of our perceptions with the objective (<I>gegenstandlich </I>) nature of the things perceived. Not in one single instance, so far, have we been led to the conclusion that our sense-perceptions, scientifically controlled, induce in our minds ideas respecting the outer world that are, by their very nature, at variance 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 120</B></FONT><P>

with reality, or that there is an inherent incompatibility between the outer world and our sense-perceptions of it.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "But then come the Neo-Kantian agnostics and say. . . ."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en54">54</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We shall leave to another time the examination of the arguments of the Neo-Kantians. Let us remark here that anybody in the least acquainted with the subject, or even the least bit attentive, cannot fail to understand that Engels is here expounding the very same materialism against which the Machians are always and everywhere doing battle. And now just watch the manner in which Bazarov revises Engels: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Here," writes Bazarov in connection with the fragment of the quotation we have given, "Engels is actually attacking Kantian idealism. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is not true. Bazarov is muddling things. In the passage which he quoted, and which is quoted by us more fully, there is <I>not a syllable either</I> about Kantianism or about idealism. Had Bazarov really read the whole of Engels' article, he could not have avoided seeing that Engels speaks of Neo-Kantianism, and of Kant's whole line, <I>only in the next</I> paragraph, just where we broke off our quotation. And had Bazarov attentively read and reflected on the fragment he himself quotes, he could not have avoided seeing that in the arguments of the agnostic which Engels here refutes there is <I>not a trace</I> of either idealism or Kantianism; for idealism begins only when the philosopher says that things are our sensations, while Kantianism begins when the philosopher says that the thing-in-itself exists but is unknowable. Bazarov confuses Kantianism with Humism; and he confuses them because, being himself a semi-Berkeleian, semi-Humean of the Machian sect, he does not understand (as will be shown in detail below) the distinction between the Humean and the materialist opposition to Kantianism. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 121</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  ". . . But, alas!" continues Bazarov, "his argument is aimed against Plekhanov's philosophy just as<A NAME="p121"> much as it is against Kantian philosophy. In the school of Plekhanov-Orthodox,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en55">55</A>]</FONT> as Bogdanov has already pointed out, there is a fatal misunderstanding regarding consciousness. To Plekhanov, as to all idealists, it seems that everything perceptually given, i.e., cognised, is 'subjective'; that to proceed only from what is factually given is to be a solipsist; that real being can be found only beyond the boundaries of everything that is immediately given. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is entirely in the spirit of Chernov and his assurances that Liebknecht was a true-Russian Narodnik! If Plekhanov is an idealist who has deserted Engels, then why is it that you, who are supposedly an adherent of Engels, are not a materialist? This is nothing but wretched mystification, Comrade Bazarov! By means of the Machian expression "<I>immediately given </I>" you begin to confuse the difference between agnosticism, idealism and materialism. Don't you understand that such expressions as the "immediately given" and the "factually given" are part of the rigmarole of the Machians, the immanentists, and the other reactionaries in philosophy, a masquerade, whereby the agnostic (and sometimes, as in Mach's case, the idealist too) disguises himself in the cloak of the materialist? For the materialist the "factually given" is the outer world, the image of which is our sensations. For the idealist the "factually given" is sensation, and the outer world is declared to be a "complex of sensations." For the agnostic the "immediately given" is also sensation, but the agnostic <I>does not go on</I> either to the materialist recognition of the reality of the outer world, or to the idealist recognition of the world as our sensation. Therefore your statement that "real being [according to 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 122</B></FONT><P>

Plekhanov] can be found only beyond the boundaries of <I>everything that is immediately given </I>" is sheer nonsense and inevitably follows from your Machian position. But while you have a perfect right to adopt any position you choose, including a Machian one, you have no right to falsify Engels once you have undertaken to speak of him. And from Engels' words it is perfectly clear that for the materialist real being lies <I>beyond</I> the "sense-perceptions," impressions and ideas of man, while for the agnostic it is impossible to go <I>beyond</I> these perceptions. Bazarov believed Mach, Avenarius, and Schuppe when they said that the "immediately" (or factually) given connects the perceiving <I>self</I> with the perceived environment in the famous "indissoluble" co-ordination, and endeavours, unobserved by the reader, to impute this nonsense to the materialist Engels! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . It is as though the foregoing passage from Engels was deliberately written by him in a very popular and accessible form in order to dissipate this idealist misunderstanding. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Not for nought was Bazarov a pupil of Avenarius! He continues his mystification: under the pretence of combating idealism (of which Engels is not speaking here), he smuggles in the <I>idealist</I> "co-ordination." Not bad, Comrade Bazarov! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . The agnostic asks, how do we know that our subjective senses give us a correct presentation of objects?. . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You are muddling things, Comrade Bazarov! Engels himself does not speak of, and does not even ascribe to his foe the agnostic, such nonsense as "<I>subjective </I>" senses. There are no other senses except human, i.e., "subjective" senses, for we are speaking from the standpoint of man and not of a hobgoblin. You are again trying to impute Machism to Engels, to imply that he says: the agnostic regards senses, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 123</B></FONT><P>

or, to be more precise, sensations, as <I>only</I> subjective (which the agnostic does <I>not</I> do!), while we and Avenarius have "co-ordinated" the object into an indissoluble connection with the subject. Not bad, Comrade Bazarov! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . But what do you term 'correct'? -- Engels rejoins. -- That is correct which is confirmed by our practice; and consequently, since our sense-perceptions are confirmed by experience, they are not 'subjective,' that is, they are not arbitrary, or illusory, but correct and real as such. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You are muddling things, Comrade Bazarov! You have substituted for the question of the existence of things outside our sensations, perceptions, ideas, the question of the criterion of the correctness of our ideas of "these things themselves," or, more precisely, you are <I>hedging</I> the former question with the help of the latter. But Engels says explicitly and clearly that what distinguishes him from the agnostic is not only the agnostic's doubt as to whether our images are "correct," but also the agnostic's doubt as to whether we may speak of the <I>things themselves</I>, as to whether we may have "certain" knowledge of their existence. Why did Bazarov resort to this juggling? In order to obscure and confound what is the <I>basic</I> question for materialism (and for Engels, as a materialist), <I>viz</I>., the question of the existence of things outside our mind, which, by acting on our sense-organs evoke sensations. It is impossible to be a materialist without answering this question in the affirmative; but one can be a materialist and still differ on what constitutes the criterion of the correctness of the images presented by our senses. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And Bazarov muddles matters still more when he attributes to Engels, in the dispute with the agnostic, the absurd and ignorant expression that our sense-perceptions are confirmed by "<I>experience</I>." Engels did not use and could not 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 124</B></FONT><P>

have used this word <I>here</I>, for Engels <I>was well aware</I> that the idealist Berkeley, the agnostic Hume and the materialist Diderot all had recourse to experience. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . Inside the limits within which we have to do with objects in practice, <I>perceptions of the object and of its properties coincide with the reality existing outside us</I>. 'To coincide' is somewhat different from being a 'hieroglyphic.' 'They coincide' means that, within the given limits, the sense perception <I>is</I> [Bazarov's italics] the reality existing outside us. . . .
 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The end crowns the work! Engels has been treated <I>&agrave la</I> Mach, fried and served with a Machian sauce. But take care you do not choke, worthy cooks! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Sense-perception <I>is</I> the reality existing outside us"!! This <I>is</I> just the fundamental absurdity, the fundamental muddle and falsity of Machism, from which flows all the rest of the balderdash of this philosophy and for which Mach and Avenarius have been embraced by those arrant reactionaries and preachers of priestlore, the immanentists. However much V. Bazarov wriggled, however cunning and diplomatic he was in evading ticklish points, in the end he gave himself away and betrayed his true Machian character! To say that "sense-perception is the reality existing outside us" <I>is to return to Humism</I>, <I>or even Berkeleianism</I>, concealing itself in the fog of "co-ordination." This is either an idealist lie or the subterfuge of the agnostic, Comrade Bazarov, for sense-perception <I>is not</I> the reality existing outside us, it is only the <I>image</I> of that reality. Are you trying to make capital of the ambiguous Russian word <I>sovpadat </I>? Are you trying to lead the unsophisticated reader to believe that <I>sovpadat</I> here means "to be identical," and not "to correspond"? That means basing one's falsification of Engels 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 125</B></FONT><P>

<I>&agrave la</I> Mach on a perversion of the meaning of a quotation, and nothing more. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take the German original and you will find there the words <I>stimmen mit</I>, which means to correspond with, "to voice with" -- the latter translation is literal, for <I>Stimme</I> means voice. The words "<I>stimmen mit </I>" cannot mean "to coincide" in the sense of "<I>to be</I> identical." And even for the reader who does not know German but who reads Engels with the least bit of attention, it is perfectly clear, it cannot be otherwise than clear, that Engels throughout his whole argument treats the expression "sense-perception" as the <I>image</I> (<I>Abbild </I>) of the reality existing outside us, and that therefore the word "coincide" can be used in Russian exclusively in the sense of "correspondence," "concurrence," etc. To attribute to Engels the thought that "sense-perception <I>is</I> the reality existing outside us" is such a pearl of Machian distortion, such a flagrant attempt to palm off agnosticism and idealism as materialism, that one must admit that Bazarov has broken all records! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One asks, how can sane people in sound mind and judgment assert that "sense-perception [within what limits is not important] is the reality existing outside us"? The earth is a reality existing outside us. It cannot "coincicle" (in the sense of being identical) with our sense-perception, or be in indissoluble co-ordination with it, or be a "complex of elements" in another connection identical with sensation; for the earth existed at a time when there were no men, no sense-organs, no matter organised in that superior form in which its property of sensation is in any way clearly perceptible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is just the point, that the tortuous theories of "co-ordination," "introjection," and the newly-discovered world-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 126</B></FONT><P>

elements which we analysed in Chapter I serve to cover up this idealist absurdity. Bazarov's formulation, so inadvertently and incautiously thrown off by him, is excellent in that it patently reveals that crying absurdity, which otherwise it would have been necessary to excavate from the piles of erudite, pseudoscientific, professorial rigmarole. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All praise to you, Comrade Bazarov! We shall erect a monument to you in your lifetime. On one side we shall engrave your dictum, and on the other: "To the Russian Machian who dug the grave of Machism among the Russian Marxists!" 
<P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  We shall speak separately of the two points touched on by Bazarov in the above-mentioned quotation, <I>viz</I>., the criteria of practice of the agnostics (Machians included) and the materialists, and the difference between the theory of reflection (or images) and the theory of symbols (or hieroglyphs). For the present we shall continue to quote a little more from Bazarov: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . But what is beyond these boundaries? Of this Engels does not say a word. He nowhere manifests a desire to perform that 'transcendence,' that stepping beyond the boundaries of the perceptually-given world, which lies at the foundation of Plekhanov's 'theory of knowledge'. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Beyond what "boundaries"? Does he mean the boundaries of the "co-ordination" of Mach and Avenarius, which supposedly indissolubly merges the <I>self</I> with the environment, the subject with the object? The very question put by Bazarov is devoid of meaning. But if he had put the question in an intelligible way, he wculd have clearly seen that

the external world lies "beyond the boundaries" of man's sensations, perceptions and ideas. But the word "transcendence" once more betrays Bazarov. It is a specifically Kantian and Humean "fancy" to erect <I>in principle</I> a boundary between the <I>appearance</I> and the <I>thing-in-itself</I>. To pass from the appearance, or, if you will, from our sensation, perception, etc., to the thing existing outside of perception is a <I>transcendence</I>, Kant says; and <I>transcendence</I> is permissible not to knowledge but to faith. Transcendence is not permissible at all, Hume objects. And the Kantians, like the Humeans, call the materialists <I>transcendental</I> realists, "metaphysicians," who effect an illegitimate <I>passage</I> (in Latin, <I>transcensus </I>) from one region to another, fundamentally different, region. In the works of the contemporary professors of philosophy who follow the reactionary line of Kant and Hume, you may encounter (take only the names enumerated by Voroshilov-Chernov) endless repetitions made in a thousand keys of the charge that materialism is "metaphysical" and "transcendent." Bazarov borrowed from the reactionary professors both the word and the line of thought, and flourishes them in the name of "recent positivism"! As a matter of fact the very idea of the "transcendence," i.e., of a boundary <I>in principle</I> between the appearance and the thing-in-itself, is a nonsensical idea of the agnostics (Humeans and Kantians included) and the idealists. We have already explained this in connection with Engels' example of alizarin, and we shall explain it again in the words of Feuerbach and Joseph Dietzgen. But let us first finish with Bazarov's "revision" of Engels: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . In one place in his <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, Engels says that 'being' outside of the realm of perception is an <I>offene Frage</I>, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 128</B></FONT><P>

i.e., a question, for the answer to which, or even for the asking of which we have no data." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bazarov repeats this argument after the German Machian, Friedrich Adler. This last example is perhaps even worse than the "sense-perception" which "is the reality existing outside us." In his <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, p. 31 (5th Germ. ed.), Engels says: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The unity of the world does not consist in its being, although its being is a pre-condition of its unity, as it must certainly first <I>be</I>, before it can be <I>one</I>. Being, indeed, is always an open question (<I>offene Frage </I>) beyond the point where our sphere of observation (<I>Gesichtskreis </I>) ends. The real unity of the world consists in its materiality, and this is proved not by a few juggling<A NAME="p128"> phrases, but by a long and wearisome development of philosophy and natural science."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en56">56</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Behold the new hash our cook has prepared. Engels is speaking of being <I>beyond</I> the point where our sphere of observation ends, for instance, the existence of men on Mars. Obviously, such being is indeed an open question. And Bazarov, as though deliberately refraining from giving the full quotation, paraphrases Engels as saying that "<I>being beyond the realm of perception </I>" is an open question!! This is the sheerest nonsense and Engels is here being saddled with the views of those professors of philosophy whom Bazarov is accustomed to take at their word and whom Dietzgen justly called the graduated flunkeys of clericalism or fideism. Indeed, fideism positively asserts that something does exist "beyond the world of perception." The materialists, in agreement with natural science, vigorously deny this. An intermediate position is held by those professors, Kantians, Humeans (including the Machians), etc., "who have found the truth outside materialism and idealism" and who "com-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 129</B></FONT><P>

promise," saying: it is an open question. Had Engels ever said anything like this, it would be a shame and disgrace to call oneself a Marxist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But enough! Half a page of quotation from Bazarov presents such a complete tangle that we are obliged to content ourselves with what has already been said and not to continue following all the waverings of Machian thought.

                                          ON THE THING-IN-ITSELF
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  To show how absurd are the assertions of our Machians that the materialists Marx and Engels denied the existence of things-in-themselves (i.e., things outside our sensations, perceptions, and so forth) and the possibility of their cognition, and that they admitted the existence of an absolute boundary between the appearance and the thing-in-itself, we shall give a few more quotations from Feuerbach. The whole trouble with our Machians is that they set about parroting the words of the reactionary professors on dialectical materialism without themselves knowing anything <I>either</I> of dialectics <I>or</I> of materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Modern philosophical spiritualism," says Feuerbach, "which calls itself idealism, utters the annihilating, in its own opinion, stricture against materialism that it is dogmatism, <I>viz</I>., that it starts from the sensuous (<I>sinnlichen </I>) world as though from an undisputed (<I>ausgemacht </I>) objective truth, and assumes that it is a world in itself (<I>an sich </I>), i.e., as existing without us, while in reality the world is only a product of spirit" (<I>S&aumlmtliche Werke</I>, X. Band, 1866, S. 185). 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 130</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  This seems clear enough. The world in itself is a world that exists <I>without us</I>. This materialism of Feuerbach's, like the materialism of the seventeenth century contested by Bishop Berkeley, consisted in the recognition that "objects in themselves" exist outside our mind. The <I>an sich</I> (of itself, or "in itself") of Feuerbach is the direct opposite of the <I>an sich</I> of Kant. Let us recall the excerpt from Feuerbach already quoted, where he rebukes Kant because for the latter the "thing-in-itself" is an "abstraction without reality." For Feuerbach the "thing-in-itself" is an "abstraction <I>with</I> reality," that is, a world existing outside us, completely knowable and fundamentally not different from "appearance." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Feuerbach very ingeniously and clearly explains how ridiculous it is to postulate a "transcendence" from the world of phenomena to the world in itself, a sort of impassable gulf created by the priests and taken over from them by the professors of philosophy. Here is one of his explanations: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Of course, the products of fantasy are also products of nature, for the force of fantasy, like all other human forces, is in the last analysis (<I>zuletzt </I>) both in its basis and in its origin a force of nature; nevertheless, a human being is a being distinguished from the sun, moon and stars, from stones, animals and plants, in a word, from those beings (<I>Wesen </I>) which he designates by the general name, 'nature'; and consequently, man's presentations (<I>Bilder </I>) of the sun, moon and stars and the other beings of nature (<I>Naturwesen </I>), although these presentations are products of nature, are yet products distinct from their objects in nature" (<I>Werke</I>, Band VII, Stuttgart, 1903, S. 516). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The objects of our ideas are distinct from our ideas, the thing-in-itself is distinct from the thing-for-us, for the latter is only a part, or only one aspect, of the former, just as 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 131</B></FONT><P>

man himself is only a fragment of the nature reflected in his ideas. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . The taste-nerve is just as much a product of nature as salt is, but it does not follow from this that the taste of salt is directly as such an objective property of salt, that what salt is merely as an object of sensation it also is in itself (<I>an und f&uumlr sich</I>), hence that the sensation of salt on the tongue is a property of salt thought of without sensation (<I>des ohne Empfindung gedachten Salzes </I>). . . ." And several pages earlier: "Saltiness, as a taste, is the subjective expression of an objective property of salt" (ibid, p. 514). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Sensation is the result of the action of a thing-in-itself, existing objectively outside us, upon our sense-organs -- such is Feuerbach's theory. Sensation is a subjective image of the objective world, of the world <I>an und f&uumlr sich</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . So is man also a being of nature (<I>Naturwesen </I>), like sun, star, plant, animal, and stone, nevertheless, he is distinct from nature, and, consequently, nature in the head and heart of man is distinct from nature outside the human head and heart." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . However, this object, <I>viz</I>., man, is the only object in which, according to the statement of the idealists themselves, the requirement of the 'identity of object and subject' is realised; for man is an object whose equality and unity with my being are beyond all possible doubt. . . . And is not one man for another, even the most intimate, an object of fantasy, of the imagination? Does not each man comprehend another in his own way, after his own mind (<I>in und nach seinem Sinne </I>)? . . . And if even between man and man, between mind and mind, there is a very considerable difference which it is impossible to ignore, how much greater must be the difference between an unthinking, non-human, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 132</B></FONT><P>

dissimilar (to us) being in itself (<I>Wesen an sich </I>) and the same being as we think of it, perceive it and apprehend it?" (<I>ibid</I>., p. 518). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  All the mysterious, sage and subtle distinctions between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself are sheer philosophical balderdash. In practice each one of us has observed times without number the simple and palpable transformation of the "thing-in-itself" into phenomenon, into the "thing-for-us." It is precisely this transformation that is cognition. The "doctrine" of Machism that since we know <I>only</I> sensations, we cannot know of the <I>existence</I> of anything beyond the bounds of sensation, is an old sophistry of idealist and agnostic philosophy served up with a new sauce. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Joseph Dietzgen is a dialectical materialist. We shall show below that his mode of expression is often inexact, that he is often not free from confusion, a fact which has been seized upon by various foolish people (Eugen Dietzgen among them) and of course by our Machians. But they did not take the trouble or were unable to analyse the dominant line of his philosophy and to disengage his materialism from alien elements. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Let us take the world as the 'thing-in-itself,'" says Dietzgen in his <I>The Nature of the Workings of the Human Mind</I>. "We shall easily see that the 'world <I>in itself'</I> and the world as it <I>appears</I> to us, the phenomena of the world, differ from each other only as the whole differs from its parts" (Germ. ed., 1903, p. 65). "A phenomenon differs no more and no less from the thing which produces it than the ten-mile stretch of a road differs from the road itself" (pp. 71-72). There is not, nor can there be, any essential difference here, any "transcendence," or "innate disagreement." But a difference there is, to be sure, <I>viz</I>., the passage <I>beyond the</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 133</B></FONT><P>

<I>bounds</I> of sense-perceptions to the existence of things outside us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "We learn by experience (<I>wir erfahren </I>)," says Dietzgen in his <I>Excursions of a Socialist into the Domain of the Theory of Knowledge</I>, "that each experience is only a part of that which, in the words of Kant, passes beyond the bounds of all experience. . . . For a consciousness that has become conscious of its own nature, each particle, be it of dust, or of stone, or of wood, is something <I>unknowable in its full extent</I> (<I>Unauskenntliches </I>), i.e., each particle is inexhaustible material for the human faculty of cognition and, consequently, something which passes beyond experience" (<I>Kleinere philosophische Schriften</I> [<I>Smaller Philosophical Essays </I>], 1903, S. 199). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You see: <I>in the words of Kant</I>, i.e., adopting -- exclusively for purposes of popularisation, for purposes of contrast -- Kant's <I>erroneous</I>, confusing terminology, Dietzgen recognises the passage "beyond experience." This is a good example of what the Machians are grasping at when they pass from materialism to agnosticism: you see, they say, we do not wish to go "beyond experience", for us "sense-perception <I>is</I> the reality existing outside us." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Unhealthy mysticism [Dietzgen says, objecting precisely to such a philosophy] unscientifically separates the absolute truth from the relative truth. It makes of the thing as it appears and the 'thing-in-itself,' that is, of the appearance and the verity, two categories which differ <I>toto coelo</I> [completely, fundamentally] from each other and are not contained in any common category" (S. 200). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We can now judge the knowledge and ingenuity of Bogdanov, the Russian Machian, who does not wish to acknowl-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 134</B></FONT><P>

edge himself a Machian and wishes to be regarded as a Marxist in philosophy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "A golden mean [between "panpsychism and panmaterialism"] has been adopted by materialists of a more critical shade who have rejected the <I>absolute</I> unknowability of the 'thing-in-itself,' but at the same time regard it as being <I>fundamentally</I> [Bogdanov's italics] different from the 'phenomenon' and, therefore, always only 'dimly discernible' in it, outside of experience as far as its content is concerned [that is, presumably, as far as the "elements" are concerned, which are not the same as elements of experience], but yet Iying within the bounds of what is called the forms of experience, i.e., time, space and causality. Such is approximately the standpoint of the French materialists of the eighteenth century and among<A NAME="p134"> the modern philosophers -- Engels and his Russian follower, Beltov"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en57">57</A>]</FONT> (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. II, 2nd ed., 1907, pp. 40-41). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is a complete muddle. 1) The materialists of the <I>seventeenth century</I>, against whom Berkeley argues, hold that "objects in themselves" are absolutely knowable, for our presentations, ideas, are only copies or reflections of those objects, which exist "outside the mind" (see <A HREF="MEC08-old.html#intro">Introduction</A>). 2) <I>Feuerbach</I>, and J. Dietzgen after him, vigorously dispute any "fundamental" difference between the thing-in-itself and the phenomenon, and Engels disposes of this view by his brief example of the transformation of the "thing-in-itself" into the "thing-for-us." 3) Finally, to maintain that the materialists regard things-in-themselves as "always only dimly discernible in the phenomenon" is sheer nonsense, as we have seen from Engels' refutation of the agnostic. The reason for Bogdanov's distortion of materialism lies in his failure to understand the relation of absolute truth to relative truth 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 135</B></FONT><P>

(of which we shall speak later). As regards the "outside-of-experience" thing-in-itself and the "elements of experience," these are already the beginnings of the Machian muddle of which we have already said enough. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Parroting the incredible nonsense uttered by the reactionary professors about the materialists, disavowing Engels in 1907, and attempting to "revise" Engels into agnosticism in 1908 -- such is the philosophy of the "recent positivism" of the Russian Machians!

                                   4.&nbsp;DOES OBJECTIVE TRUTH EXIST?
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Bogdanov declares: "As I understand it, Marxism contains a denial of the unconditional objectivity of any truth whatsoever, the denial of all eternal truths" (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, pp. iv-v). What is meant by "<I>unconditional</I> objectivity"? "Truth for all eternity" is "an objective truth in the absolute meaning of the word," says Bogdanov in the same passage, and agrees to recognise "objective truth only within the limits of a given epoch." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Two questions are obviously confused here: 1) Is there such a thing as objective truth, that is, can human ideas have a content that does not depend on a subject, that does not depend either on a human being, or on humanity? 2) If so, can human ideas, which give expression to objective truth, express it all at one time, as a whole, unconditionally, absolutely, or only approximately, relatively? This second question is a question of the relation of absolute truth to relative truth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov replies to the second question clearly, explicitly and definitely by rejecting even the slightest admission

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 136</B></FONT><P>

of absolute truth and by accusing Engels of <I>eclecticism</I> for making such an admission. Of this discovery of eclecticism in Engels by A. Bogdanov we shall speak separately later on. For the present we shall confine ourselves to the first question, which Bogdanov, without saying so explicitly, likewise answers in the negative -- for although it is possible to deny the element of relativity in one or another human idea without denying the existence of objective truth, it is impossible to deny absolute truth without denying the existence of objective truth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . The criterion of objective truth," writes Bogdanov a little further on (p. ix), "in Beltov's sense, does not exist truth is an ideological form, an organising form of human experience. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Neither "Beltov's sense" -- for it is a question of one of the fundamental philosophical problems and not of Beltov -- nor the criterion of truth -- which must be treated separately, without confounding it with the question of whether objective truth <I>exists</I> -- has anything to do with the case here. Bogdanov's negative answer to the latter question is clear:  if truth is <I>only</I> an ideological form, then there can be no truth independent of the subject, of humanity, for neither Bogdanov nor we know any other ideology but human ideology. And Bogdanov's negative answer emerges still more clearly from the second half of his statement: if truth is a form of human experience, then there can be no truth independent of humanity; there can be no objective truth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov's denial of objective truth is agnosticism and subjectivism. The absurdity of this denial is evident even from the single example of a scientific truth quoted above. Natural science leaves no room for doubt that its assertion that the earth existed prior to man is a truth. This is entirely 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 137</B></FONT><P>

compatible with the materialist theory of knowledge: the existence of the thing reflected independent of the reflector (the independence of the external world from the mind) is a fundamental tenet of materialism. The assertion made by science that the earth existed prior to man is an objective truth. This proposition of natural science is incompatible with the philosophy of the Machians and with their doctrine of truth: if truth is an organising form of human experience, then the assertion that the earth exists <I>outside</I> human experience cannot be true. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But that is not all. If truth is only an organising form of human experience, then the teachings, say, of Catholicism are also true. For there is not the slightest doubt that Catholicism is an "organising form of human experience." Bogdanov himself senses the crying falsity of his theory and it is extremely interesting to watch how he attempts to extricate himself from the swamp into which he has fallen. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The basis of objectivity," we read in Book I of <I>Empirio-Monism</I>, "must lie in the sphere of collective experience. We term those data of experience objective which have the same vital meaning for us and for other people, those data upon which not only we construct our activities without contradiction, but upon which, we are convinced, other people must also base themselves in order to avoid contradiction. The objective character of the physical world consists in the fact that it exists not for me personally, but for everybody [that is not true! It exists <I>independently</I> of "everybody"!], and has a dehnite meaning for everybody, the same, I am convinced, as for me. The objectivity of the physical series is its <I>universal significance </I>" (p. 25, Bogdanov's italics). "The objectivity of the physical bodies we encounter in our experience is in the last analysis established by the mutual verification and co-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 138</B></FONT><P>

ordination of the utterances of various people. In general, the physical world is socially-co-ordinated, socially-harmonised, in a word, <I>socially-organised experience </I>" (p. 36, Bogdanov's italics). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We shall not repeat that this is a fundamentally untrue, idealist definition, that the physical world exists independently of humanity and of human experience, that the physical world existed at a time when no "sociality" and no "organisation" of human experience was possible, and so forth. We shall now stop to expose the Machian philosophy from another aspect, namely, that objectivity is so defined that religious doctrines, which undoubtedly possess a "universal significance," and so forth, come under the definition. But listen to Bogdanov again: "We remind the reader once more that 'objective' experience is by no means the same as 'social' experience. . . . Social experience is far from being altogether socially organised and always contains various contradictions, so that certain of its parts do not agree with others. Sprites and hobgoblins may exist in the sphere of social experience of a given people or of a given group of people -- for example, the peasantry; but they need not therefore be included under socially-organised or objective experience, for they do not harmonise with the rest of collective experience and do not fit in with its organising forms, for example, with the chain of causality" (p. 45) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Of course it is very gratifying that Bogdanov himself "does not include" the social experience in respect to sprites and hobgoblins under objective experience. But this well-meant amendment in the spirit of anti-fideism by no means corrects the fundamental error of Bogdanov's whole position. Bogdanov's definition of objectivity and of the physical world completely falls to the ground, since the religious 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 139</B></FONT><P>

doctrine has "universal significance" to a greater degree than the scientific doctrine; the greater part of mankind cling to the former doctrine to this day. Catholicism has been "socially organised, harmonised and co-ordinated" by centuries of development; it "<I>fits in </I>" with the "chain of causality" in the most indisputable manner; for religions did not originate without cause, it is not by accident that they retain their hold over the masses under modern conditions, and it is quite "in the order of things" that professors of philosophy should adapt themselves to them. If this undoubtedly universally significant and undoubtedly highly-organised religious social experience does "not harmonise" with the "experience" of science, it is because there is a radical and fundamental difference between the two, which Bogdanov obliterated when he rejected objective truth. And however much Bogdanov tries to "correct" himself by saying that fideism, or clericalism, does not harmonise with science, the undeniable fact remains that Bogdanov's denial of objective truth completely "harmonises" with fideism. Contemporary fideism does not at all reject science; all it rejects is the "exaggerated claims" of science, to wit, its claim to objective truth. If objective truth exists (as the materialists think), if natural science, reflecting the outer world in human "experience," is alone capable of giving us objective truth, then all fideism is absolutely refuted. But if there is no objective truth, if truth (including scientific truth) is only an organising form of human experience, then this in itself is an admission of the fundamental premise of clericalism, the door is thrown open for it, and a place is cleared for the "organising forms" of religious expericnce. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The question arises, does this denial of objective truth belong personally to Bogdanov, who refuses to own himself 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 140</B></FONT><P>

a Machian, or does it follow from the fundamental teachings of Mach and Avenarius? The latter is the only possible an swer to the question. If only sensation exists in the world (Avenarius in 1876), if bodies are complexes of sensations (Mach, in the <I>Analysis of Sensations </I>), then we are obviously confronted with a philosophical subjectivism which inevitably leads to the denial of objective truth. And if sensations are called "elements" which in one connection give rise to the physical and in another to the psychical, this, as we have seen, only confuses but does not reject the fundamental point of departure of empirio-criticism. Avenarius and Mach recognise sensations as the source of our knowledge. Consequently, they adopt the standpoint of empiricism (all knowledge clerives from experience) or sensationalism (all knowledge derives from sensations). But this standpoint gives rise to the difference between the fundamental philosophical trends, idealism and materialism and does not eliminate that difference, no matter in what "new" verbal garb ("elements") you clothe it. Both the solipsist, that is, the subjective idealist, and the materialist may regard sensations as the source of our knowledge. Both Berkeley and Diderot started from Locke. The first premise of the theory of knowledge undoubtedly is that the sole source of our knowledge is sensation. Having recognised the first premise, Mach confuses the second important premise, i.e., regarding the objective reality that is given to man in his sensations, or that forms the source of man's sensations. Starting from sensations, one may follow the line of subjectivism, which leads to solipsism ("bodies are complexes or combinations of sensations"), or the line of objectivism, which leads to materialism (sensations are images of objects, of the external world). For the first point of view, i.e., agnosticism, or, pushed a little further, subjec-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 141</B></FONT><P>

tive idealism, there can be no objective truth. For the second point of view, i.e., materialism, the recognition of objective truth is essential. This old philosophical question of the two trends, or rather, of the two possible deductions from the premises of empiricism and sensationalism, is not solved by Mach, it is not eliminated or overcome by him, but is <I>muddled</I> by verbal trickery with the word "element," and the like. Bogdanov's denial of objective truth is an inevitable consequence of Machism as a whole, and not a deviation from it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Engels in his <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I> calls Hume and Kant philosophers "who question the possibility of any cognition, or at least of an exhaustive cognition, of the world." Engels, therefore, lays stress on what is common both to Hume and Kant, and not on what divides them. Engels states further that "what is decisive in the refutation<A NAME="p141"> of this [Humean and Kantian] view has already been said by Hegel" (4th Germ. ed., pp. 15-16).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en58">58</A>]</FONT> In this connection it seems to me not uninteresting to note that Hegel, declaring <I>materialism</I> to be "a consistent system of empiricism," wrote: "For empiricism the external (<I>das Ausserliche </I>) in general is the truth, and if then a supersensible too be admitted, nevertheless knowledge of it cannot occur (<I>soll doch eine Erkenntnis desselben</I> [<I>d</I>. <I>h</I>. <I>des Uebersinnlichen </I>] <I>nicht stattfinden k&oumlnnen </I>) and one must keep exclusively to what belongs to perception (<I>das der Wahrnehmung Angeh&oumlrige </I>). However, this principle in its realisation (<I>Durchf&uumlhrung </I>) produced what was subsequently termed materialism. This materialism regards matter, as such, as the truly objective (<I>das wahrhaft Objektive </I>)."*

  All knowledge comes from experience, from sensation, from perception. That is true. But the question arises, does <I>objective reality</I> "belong to perception," i.e., is it the source of perception? If you answer yes, you are a materialist. If you answer no, you are inconsistent and will inevitably arrive at subjectivism, or agnosticism, irrespective of whether you deny the knowability of the thing-in-itself, or the objectivity of time, space and causality (with Kant), or whether you do not even permit the thought of a thing-in-itself (with Hume). The inconsistency of your empiricism, of your philosophy of experience, will in that case lie in the fact that you deny the objective content of experience, the objective truth of experimental knowledge. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Those who hold to the line of Kant or Hume (Mach and Avenarius are among the latter, in so far as they are not pure Berkeleians) call us, the materialists, "metaphysicians" because we recognise objective reality which is given us in experience, because we recognise an objective source of our sensations independent of man. We materialists follow Engels in calling the Kantians and Humeans <I>agnostics</I>, because they deny objective reality as the source of our sensations. Agnostic is a Greek word: <I>a</I> in Greek means "no," <I>gnosis</I> "knowledge." The agnostic says: <I>I do not know</I> if there is an objective reality which is reflected, imaged by our sensations; I declare there is no way of knowing this (see the words of Engels above quoted setting forth the position of the agnostic). Hence the denial of objective truth by the agnostic, and the tolerance -- the philistine, cowardly tolerance -- of the dogmas regarding sprites, hobgoblins, Catholic saints, and the like. Mach and Avenarius, pretentiously resorting to a "new" terminology, a supposedly "new" 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 143</B></FONT><P>

point of view, repeat, in fact, although in a confused and muddled way, the reply of the agnostic: on the one hand, bodies are complexes of sensations (pure subjectivism, pure Berkeleianism); on the other hand, if we rechristen our sensations "elements," we may think of them as existing independently of our sense-organs! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Machians love to declaim that they are philosophers who completely trust the evidence of our sense-organs, who regard the world as actually being what it seems to us to be, full of sounds, colours, etc., whereas to the materialists, they say, the world is dead, devoid of sound and colour, and in its reality different from what it seems to be, and so forth. Such declamations, for example, are indulged in by J. Petzoldt, both in his <I>Introduction to the Philosophy of Pure Experience and in his World Problem from the Positivist Standpoint</I> (1906). Petzoldt is parroted by Mr. Victor Chernov, who waxes enthusiastic over the "new" idea. But, in fact, the Machians are subjectivists and agnostics, for they do not <I>sufficiently</I> trust the evidence of our sense-organs and are inconsistent in their sensationalism. They do not recognise objective reality, independent of man, as the source of our sensations. They do not regard sensations as a true copy of this objective reality, thereby directly conflicting with natural science and throwing the door open for fideism. On the contrary, for the materialist the world is richer, livelier, more varied than it actually seems, for with each step in the development of science new aspects are discovered. For the materialist, sensations are images of the sole and ultimate objective reality, ultimate not in the sense that it has already been explored to the end, but in the sense that there is not and cannot be any other. This view irrevocably closes the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 144</B></FONT><P>

door not only to every species of fideism, but also to that professorial scholasticism which, while not recognising an objective reality as the source of our sensations, "deduces" the concept of the objective by means of such artificial verbal constructions as universal significance, socially-organised, and so on and so forth, and which is unable, and frequently unwilling, to separate objective truth from belief in sprites and hobgoblins. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Machians contemptuously shrug their shoulders at the "antiquated" views of the "dogmatists," the materialists, who still cling to the concept <I>matter</I>, which supposedly has been refuted by "recent science" and "recent positivism." We shall speak separately of the new theories of physics on the structure of matter. But it is absolutely unpardonable to confound, as the Machians do, any particular theory of the structure of matter with the epistemological category, to confound the problem of the new properties of new aspects of matter (electrons, for example) with the old problem of the theory of knowledge, with the problem of the sources of our knowledge, the existence of objective truth, etc. We are told that Mach "discovered the world-elements": red, green, hard, soft, loud, long, etc. We ask, is a man given objective reality when he sees something red or feels something hard, etc., or not? This hoary philosophical query is confused by Mach. If you hold that it is not given, you, together with Mach, inevitably sink to subjectivism and agnosticism and deservedly fall into the embrace of the immanentists, i.e., the philosophical Menshikovs. If you hold that it is given, a philosophical concept is needed for this objective reality, and this concept has been worked out long, long ago. This concept is <I>matter</I>. Matter is a philosophical 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 145</B></FONT><P>

category denoting the objective reality which is given to mall by his sensations, and which is copied, photographed and reflected by our sensations, while existing independently of them. Therefore, to say that such a concept can become "antiquated" is <I>childish talk</I>, a senseless repetition of the arguments of fashionable <I>reactionary</I> philosophy. Could the struggle between materialism and idealism, the struggle between the tendencies or lines of Plato and Democritus in philosophy, the struggle between religion and science, the denial of objective truth and its assertion, the struggle between the adherents of supersensible knowledge and its adversaries have become antiquated during the two thousand years of the development of philosophy? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Acceptance or rejection of the concept matter is a question of the confidence man places in the evidence of his sense-organs, a question of the source of our knowledge, a question which has been asked and debated from the very inception of philosophy, which may be disguised in a thousand different garbs by professorial clowns, but which can no more become antiquated than the question whether the source of human knowledge is sight and touch, healing and smell. To regard our sensations as images of the external world, to recognise objective truth, to hold the materialist theory of knowledge -- these are all one and the same thing. To illustrate this, I shall only quote from Feuerbach and from two textbooks of philosophy, in order that the reader may judge how elementary this question is. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "How banal," wrote Feuerbach, "to deny that sensation is the evangel, the gospel (<I>Verk&uumlndung </I>) of an objective saviour."* A strange, a preposterous terminology, as you see, 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 146</B></FONT><P>

but a perfectly clear philosophical line: sensation reveals objective truth to man. "My sensation is subjective, but its foundation [or ground -- <I>Grund </I>] is objective" (S. 195). Compare this with the quotation given above where Feuerbach says that materialism starts from the perceptual world as an ultimate (<I>ausgemachte </I>) objective truth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Sensationalism, we read in Franck's dictionary of philosophy,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp146">*</A>]</FONT> is a doctrine which deduces all our ideas "from the experience of sense-organs, reducing all knowledge to sensations." There is subjective sensationalism (scepticism and Berkeleianism), moral sensationalism (Epicureanism), and objective sensationalism. "Objective sensationalism is nothing but materialism, for matter or bodies are, in the opinion of the materialists, the only objects that can affect our senses (<I>atteindre nos sens </I>)." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "If sensationalism," says Schwegler in his history of philosophy,** "asserted that truth or being can be apprehended exclusively by means of the senses, one had only [Schwegler is speaking of philosophy at the end of the eighteenth century in France] to formulate this proposition objectively and one had the thesis of materialism: only the perceptual exists; there is no other being save material being." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These elementary truths, which have managed to find their way even into the textbooks, have been forgotten by our Machians.

                              ECLECTICISM OF ENGELS AS DISCOVERED<BR>
                                                 BY A BOGDANOV
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Bogdanov made his discovery in 1906, in the preface to Book III of his <I>Empirio-Monism</I>. "Engels in <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>," writes Bogdanov, "expresses himself almost in the same sense in which I have just described the relativity of truth" (p. v) -- that is, in the sense of denying all eternal truth, "denying the unconditional objectivity of all truth whatsoever." "Engels is wrong in his indecision, in the fact that in spite of his irony he recognises certain 'eternal truths,' wretched though they may be. . ." (p. viii). "Only inconsistency can here permit such eclectic reservations as those of Engels. . ." (p. ix). Let us cite one instance of Bogdanov's refutation of Engels' eclecticism. "Napoleon died on May 5, 1821," says Engels in <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, in the chapter "Eternal Truths," where he reminds D&uumlhring of the "platitudes" (<I>Plattheiten </I>) to which he who claims to discover eternal truths in the historical sciences has to confine himself. Bogdanov thus answers Engels: "What sort of 'truth' is that? And what is there 'eternal' about it? The recording of a single correlation, which perhaps even has no longer any real significance for our generation, cannot serve as a basis for any activity, and leads nowhere" (p. ix). And on page viii: "Can <I>Plattheiten</I> be called <I>Wahrheiten </I>? Are 'platitudes' truths? Truth is a vital organising form of experience; it leads us somewhere in our activity and provides a point of support in the struggle of life." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is quite clear from these two quotations that Bogdanov, instead of refuting Engels, makes a mere <I>declamation</I>. If you cannot assert that the proposition "Napoleon died on 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 148</B></FONT><P>

May 5, 1821," is false or inexact, you acknowledge that it is true. If you do not assert that it may be refuted in the future, you acknowledge this truth to be eternal. But to call phrases such as truth is a "vital organising form of experience" an answer, is to palm off a mere <I>jumble of words</I> as philosophy. Did the earth have the history which is expounded in geology, or was the earth created in seven days? Is one to be allowed to dodge this question by talking about "vital" (what does that mean?) truth which "leads" some where, and the like? Can it be that knowledge of the history of the earth and of the history of humanity "has no real significance"? This is just turgid nonsense, used by Bogdanov to cover his <I>retreat</I>. For it is a retreat, when, having taken it upon himself to prove that the admission of eternal truths by Engels is eclecticism, he dodges the issue by a noise and clash of words and leaves unrefuted the fact that Napoleon did die on May 5, 1821, and that to regard this <I>truth</I> as refutable in the future is absurd. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The example given by Engels is elementary, and anybody without the slightest difficulty can think of scores of similar truths that are eternal and absolute and that only insane people can doubt (as Engels says, citing another example: "Paris is in France"). Why does Engels speak here of "platitudes"? Because he refutes and ridicules the dogmatic, metaphysical materialist D&uumlhring, who was incapable of applying dialectics to the relation between absolute and relative truth. To be a materialist is to acknowledge objective truth which is revealed to us by our sense-organs. To acknowledge objective truth, i.e., truth not dependent upon man and mankind, is, in one way or another, to recognise absolute truth. And it is this "one way or another" which distinguishes the metaphysical materialist D&uumlhring from the dia-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 149</B></FONT><P>

lectical materialist Engels. On the most complex questions of science in general, and of historical science in particular, D&uumlhring scattered words right and left: ultimate, final and eternal truth. Engels jeered at him. Of course there are eternal truths, Engels said, but it is unwise to use high-sounding words (<I>gewaltige Worte </I>) in connection with simple things. If we want to advance materialism, we must drop this trite play with the words "eternal truth"; we must learn to put, and answer, the question of the relation between absolute and relative truth dialectically. It was on this issue that the fight between D&uumlhring and Engels was waged thirty years ago. And Bogdanov, who managed "<I>not to notice </I>" Engels' explanation of the problem of absolute and relative truth given <I>in this very same chapter</I>, and who managed to accuse Engels of "eclecticism" for his admission of a proposition which is a truism for <I>all</I> forms of materialism, only once again betrays his utter ignorance of both materialism and dialectics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Now we come to the question," Engels writes in Anti-D&uumlhring, in the beginning of the chapter mentioned (Part I, Chap. IX), "whether any, and if so which, products of human knowledge ever can have sovereign validity and an unconditional claim (<I>Anspruch </I>) to truth" (5th German ed., p. 79). And Engels answers the question thus: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The sovereignty of thought is realised in a number of extremely unsovereignly-thinking human beings; the knowledge which has an unconditional claim to truth is realised in a number of relative errors; neither the one nor the other [i.e., neither absolutely true knowledge, nor sovereign thought] can be fully realised except through an endless eternity of human existence. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 150</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Here once again we find the same contradiction as we found above, between the character of human thought, necessarily conceived as absolute, and its reality in individual human beings with their extremely limited thought. This is a contradiction which can only be solved in the infinite progression, or what is for us, at least from a practical standpoint, the endless succession, of generations of mankind. In this sense human thought is just as much sovereign as not sovereign, and its capacity for knowledge just as much un limited as limited. It is sovereign and unlimited in its disposition (<I>Anlage </I>), its vocation, its possibilities and its historical ultimate goal; it is not sovereign and it is limited in its individual expression and in its realisation at each particular moment" (p. 81).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp150">*</A>]</FONT> 
<A NAME="p150">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "It is just the same," Engels continues, "with eternal truths."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en59">59</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This argument is extremely important for the question of <I>relativism</I>, i.e., the principle of the relativity of our knowledge, which is stressed by all Machians. The Machians <I>one and all</I> insist that they are relativists, but the Russian Machians, while repeating the words of the Germans, are afraid, or unable to propound the question of the relation of relativism to dialectics clearly and straightforwardly. For Bogdanov (as for all the Machians) recognition of the relativity of our knowledge <I>excludes</I> even the least admission of absolute truth. For Engels absolute truth is compounded

The difference is that Bogdanov tries to <I>cover up</I> his disagreement with Engels, to present it as a casual matter, etc., while Chernov feels that it is a question of a struggle against both materialism and dialectics. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 151</B></FONT><P>

from relative truths. Bogdanov is a relativist; Engels is a dialectician. Here is another, no less important, argument of Engels from the chapter of <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I> already quoted: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Truth and error, like all thought-concepts which move in polar opposites, have absolute validity only in an extremely limited field, as we have just seen, and as even Herr D&uumlhring would realise if he had any acquaintance with the first elements of dialectics, which deal precisely with the inadequacy of all polar opposites. As soon as we apply the antithesis between truth and error outside of that narrow field which has been referred to above it becomes relative and therefore unserviceable for exact scientific modes of expression; and if we attempt to apply it as absolutely valid outside that field we really find ourselves altogether beaten: both poles of the antithesis become transformed into their opposites,<A NAME="p151"> truth becomes error and error truth" (p. 86).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en60">60</A>]</FONT> Here follows the example of Boyle's law (the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure). The "grain of truth" contained in this law is only absolute truth within certain limits. The law, it appears, is a truth "only approximately." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Human thought then by its nature is capable of giving, and does give, absolute truth, which is compounded of a sum-total of relative truths. Each step in the development of science adds new grains to the sum of absolute truth, but the limits of the truth of each scientific proposition are relative, now expanding, now shrinking with the growth of knowledge. "Absolute truth," says<A NAME="p151a"> J. Dietzgen in his <I>Excursions</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en61">61</A>]</FONT> "can be seen, heard, smelt, touched and, of course, also be <I>known</I>, but it is not entirely absorbed (<I>geht nicht auf </I>) into knowledge" (p. 195). "It goes without saying that a picture does not exhaust its object and the artist 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 152</B></FONT><P>

remains behind his model. . . . How can a picture 'coincide' with its model? Approximately it can" (p. 197). "Hence, we can know nature and her parts only relatively; since even a part, though only a relation of nature, possesses nevertheless the nature of the absolute, the nature of nature as a whole (<I>des Naturganzen an sich </I>) which cannot be exhausted by knowledge. . . . How, then, do we know that behind the phenomena of nature, behind the relative truths, there is a universal, unlimited, absolute nature which does not reveal itself to man completely? . . . Whence this knowledge? It is innate; it is given us with consciousness" (p. 198). This last statement is one of the inexactitudes of Dietzgen's which led Marx,<A NAME="p152"> in one of his letters to Kugelmann, to speak of the confusion in Dietzgen's views.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en62">62</A>]</FONT> Only by seizing upon such incorrect passages can one speak of a specific philosophy of Dietzgen differing from dialectical materialism. But Dietzgen corrects himself <I>on the same page </I>: "When I say that the consciousness of eternal, absolute truth is innate in us, that it is the one and only <I>a priori</I> knowledge, experience also confirms this innate consciousness" (p. 198). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From all these statements by Engels and Dietzgen it is obvious that for dialectical materialism there is no impassable boundary between relative and absolute truth. Bogdanov entirely failed to grasp this if he could write: "It [the world outlook of the old materialism] sets itself up as the absolute <I>objective knowledge of the essence of things</I> [Bogdanov's italics] and is incompatible with the historically conditional nature of all ideologies" (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, p. iv). From the standpoint of modern materialism i.e., Marxism, the <I>limits</I> of approximation of our knowledge to objective, absolute truth are historically conditional, but the existence of such truth is <I>unconditional</I>, and the fact 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 153</B></FONT><P>

that we are approaching nearer to it is also unconditional. The contours of the picture are historically conditional, but the fact that this picture depicts an objectively existing model is unconditional. When and under what circumstances we reached, in our knowledge of the essential nature of things, the discovery of alizarin in coal tar or the discovery of electrons in the atom is historically conditional; but that every such discovery is an advance of "absolutely objective knowledge" is unconditional. In a word, every ideology is historically conditional, but it is unconditionally true that to every scientific ideology (as distinct, for instance, from religious ideology), there corresponds an objective truth, absolute nature. You will say that this distinction between relative and absolute truth is indefinite. And I shall reply: yes, it is sufficiently "indefinite" to prevent science from becoming a dogma in the bad sense of the term, from becoming something dead, frozen, ossified; but it is at the same time sufficiently "definite" to enable us to dissociate ourselves in the most emphatic and irrevocable manner from fideism and agnosticism, from philosophical idealism and the sophistry of the followers of Hume and Kant. Here is a boundary which you have not noticed, and not having noticed it, you have fallen into the swamp of reactionary philosophy. It is the boundary between dialectical materialism and relativism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are relativists, proclaim Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt. We are relativists, echo Mr. Chernov and certain Russian Machians, would-be Marxists. Yes, Mr. Chernov and Comrades Machians -- and therein lies your error. For to make relativism the basis of the theory of knowledge is inevitably to condemn oneself either to absolute scepticism, agnosticism and sophistry, or to subjectivism. Relativism as 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 154</B></FONT><P>

a basis of the theory of knowledge is not only the recognition of the relativity of our knowledge, but also a denial of any objective measure or model existing independently of humanity to which our relative knowledge approximates. From the standpoint of naked relativism one can justify any sophistry; one may regard it as "conditional" whether Napoleon died on May 5, 1821, or not; one may declare the admission, alongside of scientific ideology ("convenient" in one respect), of religious ideology (very "convenient" in another respect) a mere "convenience" for man or humanity, and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Dialectics -- as Hegel in his time explained -- <I>contains</I> the element of relativism, of negation, of scepticism, but <I>is not reducible</I> to relativism. The materialist dialectics of Marx and Engels certainly does contain relativism, but is not reducible to relativism, that is, it recognises the relativity of all our knowledge, not in the sense of denying objective truth, but in the sense that the limits of approximation of our knowledge to this truth are historically conditional. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov writes in italics: "<I>Consistent Marxism does not admit such dogmatism and such static concepts </I>" as eternal truths. (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, p. ix.) This is a muddle. If the world is eternally moving and developing matter (as the Marxists think), reflected by the developing human consciousness, what is there "static" here? The point at issue is not the immutable essence of things, or an immutable consciousness, but the <I>correspondence</I> between the consciousness which reflects nature and the nature which is reflected by consciousness. In connection with this question, and this question alone, the term "dogmatism" has a specific, characteristic philosophical flavour: it is a favourite word used by the idealists and the agnostics <I>against</I> the materialists, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 155</B></FONT><P>

as we have already seen in the case of the fairly "old" materialist, Feuerbach. The objections brought against materialism from the standpoint of the celebrated "recent positivism" are just ancient trash.

                                            THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  We have seen that Marx in 1845 and Engels in 1888 and 1892 placed the criterion of practice<A NAME="p155"> at the basis of the materialist theory of knowledge.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en63">63</A>]</FONT> "The dispute over the reality or non-reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question," says Marx in his second Thesis on Feuerbach. The best refutation of Kantian and Humean agnosticism as well as of other philosophical crotchets (<I>Schrullen </I>) is practice, repeats Engels. "The result of our action proves the conformity (<I>Uebereinstimmung </I>) of our perceptions with the objective nature<A NAME="p155a"> of the things perceived," he says in reply to the agnostics.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en64">64</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Compare this with Mach's argument about the criterion of practice: "In the common way of thinking and speaking <I>appearance</I>, <I>illusion</I>, is usually contrasted with <I>reality</I>. A pencil held in front of us in the air is seen as straight; when we dip it slantwise into water we see it as crooked. In the latter case we say that the pencil <I>appears crooked but in reality</I> it is straight. But what entitles us to declare <I>one</I> fact to be the reality, and to degrade <I>the other</I> to an appearance?. . . Our expectation is deceived when we fall into the natural error of expecting what we are accustomed to although the case is unusual. The facts are not to blame for that. In these cases, to speak of <I>appearance</I> may have a practical 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 156</B></FONT><P>

significance, but not a scientific significance. Similarly, the question which is often asked, whether the world is real or whether we merely dream it, is devoid of all scientific significance. Even the wildest dream is a fact as much as any other" (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, pp. 18-19). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is true that not only is the wildest dream a fact, but also the wildest philosophy. No doubt of this is possible after an acquaintance with the philosophy of Ernst Mach. Egregious sophist that he is, he confounds the scientific-historical and psychological investigation of human errors, of every "wild drcam" of humanity, such as belief in sprites, hobgoblins, and so forth, with the epistemological distinction between truth and "wildness<A NAME="p156">." It is as if an economist were to say that both Senior's theory<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en65">65</A>]</FONT> that the whole profit of the capitalist is obtained from the "last hour" of the worker's labour and Marx's theory are both facts, and that from the standpoint of science there is no point in asking which theory expresses objective truth and which -- the prejudice of the bourgeoisie and the venality of its professors. The tanner Joseph Dietzgen regarded the scientific, i.e., the materialist, theory of knowledge as a "universal weapon against religious belief" (<I>Kleinere philosophische Schriften</I> [<I>Smaller Philosophical Essays </I>], S. 55), but for the professor-in-ordinary Ernst Mach the distinction between the materialist and the subjective-idealist theories of knowledge "is devoid of all scientific significance"! That science is non partisan in the struggle of materialism against idealism and religion is a favourite idea not only of Mach but of all modern bourgeois professors, who are, as Dietzgen justly expresses it, "graduated flunkeys who stupefy the people by their twisted idealism" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 53). 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 157</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  And a twisted professorial idealism it is, indeed, when the criterion of practice, which for every one of us distinguishes illusion from reality, is removed by Mach from the realm of science, from the realm of the theory of knowledge. Human practice proves the correctness of the materialist theory of knowledge, said Marx and Engels, who dubbed all attempts to solve the fundamental question of epistemology without the aid of practice "scholastic" and "philosophical crotchets." But for Mach practice is one thing and the theory of knowledge another. They can be placed side by side without making the latter conditional on the former. In his last work, <I>Knowledge and Error</I>, Mach says: "Knowledge is a biologically useful (<I>f&oumlrderndes </I>) mental experience" (2nd Germ. ed., p. 115). "Only success can separate knowledge from error" (p. 116). "The concept is a physical working hypothesis" (p. 143). In their astonishing na&iumlvet&eacute our Russian Machian would-be Marxists regard such phrases of Mach's as proof that he <I>comes close</I> to Marxism. But Mach here comes just as close to Marxism as Bismarck to the labour movement, or Bishop Eulogius to democracy. With Mach such propositions <I>stand side by side</I> with his idealist theory of knowledge and do not determine the choice of one or another definite line of epistemology. Knowledge can be useful biologically, useful in human practice, useful for the preservation of life, for the preservation of the species, only when it reflects objective truth, truth which is independent of man. For the materialist the "success" of human practice proves the correspondence between our ideas and the objective nature of the things we perceive. For the solipsist "success" is everything needed <I>by me in practice</I>, which can be regarded separately from the theory of knowledge. If we include the criterion of practice in the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 158</B></FONT><P>

foundation of the theory of knowledge we inevitably arrive at materialism, says the Marxist. Let practice be materialist, says Mach, but theory is another matter.   "In practice," Mach writes in the Analysis of Sensations, "we can as little do without the idea of the self when we perform any act, as we can do without the idea of a body when we grasp at a thing. Physiologically we remain egoists and materialists with the same constancy as we forever see the sun rising again. But theoretically this view cannot be adhered to" (pp. 284-85). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Egoism is beside the point here, for egoism is not an epistemological category. The question of the apparent movement of the sun around the earth is also beside the point, for in practice, which serves us as a criterion in the theory of knowledge, we must include also the practice of astronomical observations, discoveries, etc. There remains only Mach's valuable admission that in their practical life men are entirely and exclusively guided by the materialist theory of knowledge; the attempt to obviate it "theoretically" is characteristic of Mach's <I>gelehrte</I> scholastic and twisted idealistic endeavours. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To what extent these efforts to eliminate practice -- as something unsusceptible to epistemological treatment -- in order to make room for agnosticism and idealism are not new is shown by the following example from the history of German classical philosophy. Between Kant and Fichte stands G. E. Schulze (known in the history of philosophy as Schulze-Aenesidemus). He openly advocates the sceptical trend in philosophy and calls himself a follower of Hume (and of the ancients Pyrrho and Sextus). He emphatically rejects every thing-in-itself and the possibility of objective knowledge, and emphatically insists that we should not go 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 159</B></FONT><P>

beyond "experience," beyond sensations, in which connection he anticipates the following objection from the other camp: "Since the sceptic when he takes part in the affairs of life assumes as indubitable the reality of objective things, behaves accordingly, and thus admits a criterion of truth, his own behaviour is the best and clearest refutation of his scepticism."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp159">*</A>]</FONT> "Such proofs," Schulze indignantly retorts, "are only valid for the mob (<I>P&oumlbel </I>)." For "my scepticism does not concern the requirements of practical life, but remains within the bounds of philosophy" (pp. 254, 255). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In similar manner, the subjective idealist Fichte also hopes to find room within the bounds of idealistic philosophy for that "realism which is inevitable (<I>sich aufdringt </I>) for all of us, and even for the most determined idealist, when it comes to action, i.e., the assumption that objects exist quite independently of us and outside us" (<I>Werke</I>, I, 455). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Mach's recent positivism has not travelled far from Schulze and Fichte! Let us note as a curiosity that on this question too for Bazarov there is no one but Plekhanov -- there is no beast stronger than the cat. Bazarov ridicules the "<A NAME="p159"><I>salto</I> vitale philosophy of Plekhanov" (<I>Studies</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en66">66</A>]</FONT> etc., p. 69), who indeed made the absurd remark that "belief" in the existence of the outer world "is an inevitable <I>salto vitale </I>" (vital leap) of philosophy (<I>Notes on Ludwig Feuerbach</I>, p. III). The word "belief" (taken from Hume), although put in quotation marks, discloses a confusion of terms on Plekhanov's part. There can be no question about that. But

what has Plekhanov got to do with it? Why did not Bazarov take some other materialist, Feuerbach, for instance? Is it only because he does not know him? But ignorance is no argument. Feuerbach also, like Marx and Engels, makes an impermissible -- from the point of view of Schulze, Fichte and Mach -- "leap" to practice in the fundamental problems of epistemology. Criticising idealism, Feuerbach explains its essential nature by the following striking quotation from Fichte, which superbly demolishes Machism: " 'You assume,' writes Fichte, 'that things are real, that they exist outside of you, only because you see them, hear them and touch them. But vision, touch and hearing are only sensations. . . . You perceive, not the objects, but only your sensations'" (Feuerbach, <I>Werke</I>, X. Band, S. 185). To which Feuerbach replies that a human being is not an abstract ego, but either a man or woman, and the question whether the world is sensation can be compared to the question: is the man or woman my sensation, or do our relations in practical life prove the contrary? "This is the, fundamental defect of idealism: it asks and answers the question of objectivity and subjectivity, of the reality or unreality of the world, only from the standpoint of theory" (<I>ibid</I>., p. 189). Feuerbach makes the sum-total of human practice the basis of the theory of knowledge. He says that idealists of course also recognise the reality of the <I>I</I> and the <I>Thou</I> in practical life. For the idealists "this point of view is valid only for practical life and not for speculation. But a speculation which contradicts life, which makes the standpoint of death, of a soul separated from the body, the standpoint of truth, is a dead and false speculation" (p. 192). Before we <I>perceive</I>, we breathe; we cannot exist without air, food and drink. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 161</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "Does this mean that we must deal with questions of food and drink when examining the problem of the ideality or reality of the world? -- exclaims the indignant idealist. How vile! What an offence against good manners soundly to berate materialism in the scientific sense from the chair of philosophy and the pulpit of theology, only to practise materialism with all one's heart and soul in the crudest form at the table d'h&ocircte" (p. 195). And Feuerbach exclaims that to identify subjective sensation with the objective world "is to identify pollution with procreation" (p. 198). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A comment not of the politest order, but it hits the vital spot of those philosophers who teach that sense-perception is the reality existing outside us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The standpoint of life, of practice, should be first and fundamental in the theory of knowledge. And it inevitably leads to materialism, brushing aside the endless fabrications of professorial scholasticism. Of course, we must not forget that the criterion of practice can never, in the nature of things, either confirm or refute any human idea <I>completely</I>. This criterion also is sufficiently "indefinite" not to allow human knowledge to become "absolute," but at the same time it is sufficiently definite to wage a ruthless fight on all varieties of idealism and agnosticism. If what our practice confirms is the sole, ultimate and objective truth, then from this must follow the recognition that the only path to this truth is the path of science, which holds the materialist point of view. For instance, Bogdanov is prepared to recognise Marx's theory of the circulation of money as an objective truth only for "our time," and calls it "dogmatism" to at tribute to this theory a "super-historically objective" truth (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, p. vii). This is again a muddle. The correspondence of this theory to practice cannot be 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 162</B></FONT><P>

altered by any future circumstances, for the same simple reason that makes it an <I>eternal</I> truth that Napoleon died on May 5, 1821. But inasmuch as the criterion of practice, i.e., the course of development of <I>all</I> capitalist countries in the last few decades, proves only the objective truth of Marx's <I>whole</I> social and economic theory in general, and not merely of one or other of its parts, formulations, etc., it is clear that to talk of the "dogmatism" of the Marxists is to make an unpardonable concession to bourgeois economics. The sole conclusion to be drawn from the opinion of the Marxists that Marx's theory is an objective truth is that by following the <I>path</I> of Marxist theory we shall draw closer and closer to objective truth (without ever exhausting it); but by following <I>any other path</I> we shall arrive at nothing but confusion and lies.

                                      LEFT AND FROM THE RIGHT
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Both Mach and Avenarius began their philosophical careers in the 'seventies, when the fashionable cry<A NAME="p227"> in German professorial circles was "Back to Kant"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en84">84</A>]</FONT> And, indeed, both founders of empirio-criticism in their philosophical development started from Kant. "His [Kant's] critical idealism," says Mach, "was, as I acknowledge with the dcepest gratitude, the starting point of all my critical thought. But I found 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 228</B></FONT><P>

it impossible to remain faithful to it. Very soon I began to return to the views of Berkeley . . . [and then] arrived at views akin to those of Hume. . . . And even today I cannot help regarding Berkeley and Hume as far more consistent thinkers than Kant" (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 292). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus Mach quite definitely admits that having begun with Kant he soon followed the line of Berkeley and Hume. Let us turn to Avenarius. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In his <I>Prolegomena to a</I> "<I>Critique of Pure Experience </I>" (1876), Avenarius already in the foreword states that the words <I>Kritik der reinen Erfahrung</I> (<I>Critique of Pure Experience </I>) are indicative of his attitude towards Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason," and "of course, of an antagonistic attitude" towards Kant (1876 ed., p. iv). In what does Avenarius' antagonism to Kant consist? In the fact that Kant, in Avenarius' opinion, had not sufficiently "purified experience." It is with this "purification of experience" that Avenarius deals in his <I>Prolegomena</I> (&#167;&#167; 56, 72 and many other places). Of what does Avenarius "purify" the Kantian doctrine of experience? In the first place, of apriorism. In &#167; 56 he says: "The question as to whether the superfluous <I>'a priori</I> conceptions of reason' should and could be eliminated from the content of experience and thereby <I>pure experience par excellence</I> established is, as far as I know, raised here, as such, for the first time." We have already seen that Avenarius in this way "purified" Kantianism of the recognition of necessity and causality. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Secondly, he purifies Kantianism of the assumption of substance (&#167; 95), <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the thing-in-itself, which, in Avenarius' opinion "is not given in the stuff of actual experience but is imported into it by thought." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We shall presently see that Avenarius' definition of his philosophical line entirely coincides with that of Mach, dif-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 229</B></FONT><P>

fering only in pompousness of formulation. But we must first note that Avenarius is telling a <I>plain untruth</I> when he asserts that it was he who in 1876 <I>for the first time</I> raised the question of "purifying experience," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of purifying the Kantian doctrine of apriorism and the assumption of the thing-in-itself. As a matter of fact, the development of German classical philosophy immediately after Kant gave rise to a criticism of Kantianism exactly <I>along the very line</I> followed by Avenarius. This line is represented in German classical philosophy by Schulze-Aenesidemus, an adherent of Humean agnosticism, and by J. G. Fichte, an adherent of Berkeleianism, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of subjective idealism. In 1792 Schulze-Aenesidemus criticised Kant for <I>this very</I> recognition of apriorism (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 56,141, etc.) and of the thing-in-itself. We sceptics, or followers of Hume, says Schulze, reject the thing-in-itself as being "beyond the bounds of all experience" (p. 57). We reject <I>objective knowledge</I> (p. 25); we deny that space and time really exist outside us (p. 100); we reject the presence in our experience of necessity (p. 112), causality, force, etc. (p. 113). One cannot attribute to them any "reality outside our conceptions" (p. 114). Kant proves apriority "dogmatically," saying that since we cannot think otherwise there is therefore an <I>a priori</I> law of thought. "This argument," Schulze replies to Kant, "has long been utilised in philosophy to prove the objective nature of what lies outside our ideas" (p. 141), Arguing thus, we may attribute causality to things in-themselves (p. 142). "Experience never tells us (<I>wir erfahren niemals </I>) that the action on us of objective things produces ideas," and Kant by no means proved that "this something (which lies outside our reason) must be regarded as a thing in-itself, distinct from our sensation (<I>Gemut </I>). But sensation also may be thought of as the <I>sole</I> basis of all our knowledge" 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 230</B></FONT><P>

(p. 265). The Kantian critique of pure reason "bases its argument on the proposition that every act of cognition begins with the action of objective things on our organs of sensation (<I>Gem&uumlt </I>), but it then disputes the truth and reality of this proposition" (p. 266). Kant in no way refuted the idealist Berkeley (pp. 268-72). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is evident from this that the Humean Schulze rejects Kant's doctrine of the thing-in-itself as an inconsistent concession to materialism, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., to the "dogmatic" assertion that in our sensations we are given objective reality, or, in other words, that our ideas are caused by the action of objective things (independent of our mind) on our sense-organs. The agnostic Schulze reproaches the agnostic Kant on the grounds that the latter's assumption of the thing-in-itself contradicts agnosticism and leads to materialism. In the same way, but even more vigorously, Kant is criticised by the subjective idealist Fichte, who maintains that Kant's assumption of the thing-in-itself independent of the <I>self</I> is "<I>realism </I>" (<I>Werke</I>, I, S. 483), and that Kant makes "no clear" distinction between "realism" and "idealism." Fichte sees a crying inconsistency in the assumption of Kant and the Kantians that the thing-in-itself is the "basis of objective reality" (p. 480), for this is in contradiction to critical idealism. "With you," exclaims Fichte, addressing the realist expositors of Kant, "the earth rests on the great elephant, and the great elephant rests on the earth. Your thing-in-itself, which is only thought, acts on the <I>self </I>!" ( p. 483). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus Avenarius was profoundly mistaken in imagining that he "for the first time" undertook a "purification of the experience" of Kant from apriorism and from the thing-in-itself and that he was thereby giving rise to a "new" trend in philosophy. In reality he was continuing the <I>old</I> line of Hume and 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 231</B></FONT><P>

Berkeley, Schulze-Aenesidemus and J. G. Fichte. Avenarius imagined that he was "purifying experience" in general. In reality he was only <I>purifying agnosticism of Kantianism</I>. He fought not against the agnosticism of Kant (agnosticism is a denial of objective reality given in sensation), but for a <I>purer agnosticism</I>, for the elimination of Kant's assumption, which is contradictory to agnosticism, that there is a thing-in itself, albeit unknowable, noumenal and other-sided, that there is necessity and causality, albeit <I>a priori</I>, given in our understanding, and not in objective reality. He fought Kant not from the <I>Left</I>, as the materialists fought Kant, but from the <I>Right</I>, as the sceptics and idealists fought Kant. He imagined that he was advancing, when in reality he was retreating to the programme of criticising Kant which Kuno Fischer, speaking of Schulze-Aenesidemus, aptly characterised in the following words: "The critique of pure reason with pure reason [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., apriorism] left out is scepticism. The critique of pure reason with the thing-in-itself left out is Berkeleian idealism" (<I>History of Modern Philosophy</I>, German ed., 1869, Vol. V, p. 115). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This brings us to one of the most curious episodes in our whole "Machiad," in the whole campaign of the Russian Machians against Engels and Marx. The latest discovery by Bogdanov and Bazarov, Yushkevich and Valentinov, trumpeted by them in a thousand different keys, is that Plekhanov is making a "luckless attempt to reconcile Engels with Kant by the aid of a compromise<A NAME="p231"> -- a thing-in-itself which is just a wee bit knowable" (<I>Studies</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en85">85</A>]</FONT> <I>etc</I>., p. 67 and many other places). This discovery of our Machians discloses a veritable bottomless pit of utter confusion and monstrous misunderstanding both of Kant and of the whole course of development of German classical philosophy. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 232</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The principal feature of Kant's philosophy is the reconciliation of materialism with idealism, a compromise between the two, the combination within one system of heterogeneous and contrary philosophical trends. When Kant assumes that something outside us, a thing-in-itself, corresponds to our ideas, he is a materialist. When he declares this thing-in-itself to be unknowable, transcendental, other-sided, he is an idealist. Recognising experience, sensations, as the only source of our knowledge, Kant is directing his philosophy towards sensationalism, and <I>via</I> sensationalism, under certain conditions, towards materialism. Recognising the apriority of space, time, causality, etc., Kant is directing his philosophy towards idealism. Both consistent materialists and consistent idealists (as well as the "pure" agnostics, the Humeans) have mercilessly criticised Kant for this inconsistency. The materialists blamed Kant for his idealism, rejected the idealist features of his system, demonstrated the knowability, the this-sidedness of the thing-in-itself, the absence of a fundamental difference between the thing-in-itself and the phenomenon, the need of deducing causality, etc., not from <I>a priori</I> laws of thought, but from objective reality. The agnostics and idealists blamed Kant for his assumption of the thing-in-itself as a concession to materialism, "realism" or "na&iumlve realism." Thc agnostics, moreover, rejected not only the thing-in-itself, but apriorism as well; while the idealists demanded the consistent deduction from pure thought not only of the <I>a priori</I> forms of the under standing, but of the world as a whole (by magnifying human thought to an abstract <I>Self</I> or to an "Absolute Idea," or to a "<I>Universal Will</I>," etc., etc.). And here our Machians, "without noticing" that they had taken as their teachers men who had criticised Kant from the standpoint or scepticism and idealism, began to rend their clothes and to cover their 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 233</B></FONT><P>

heads with ashes at the sight of monstrous people who criticised Kant from a <I>diametrically opposite point of view</I>, who rejected the slightest element of agnosticism (scepticism) and idealism in his system, who argued that the thing-in-ittelf is objectively real, fully knowable and this-sided, that it does not differ fundamentally from appearances that it becomes transformed into appearance at every step in the development of the individual consciousness of man and the collective consciousness of mankind. Help, they cried, this is an illegitimate mixture of materialism and Kantianism! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When I read the assurances of our Machians that they criticise Kant far more consistently and thoroughly<A NAME="p233"> than any of the antiquated materialists, it always seems to me as though Purishkevich<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en86">86</A>]</FONT> had joined our company and was shouting: I criticised the Constitutional-Democrats far more consistently and thoroughly than you Marxist gentlemen! There is no question about it, Mr. Purishkevich, politically consistent people can and always will criticise the Constitutional-Democrats from diametrically opposite points of view, but after all it must not be forgotten that you criticised the Constitutional-Democrats for being <I>excessively</I> democratic, while we criticised them for being <I>insufficiently</I> democratic! The Machians criticise Kant for being too much of a materialist, while we criticise him for not being enough of a materialist. The Machians criticise Kant frorn the Right, we from the Left. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Humean Schulze and the subjective idealist Fichte may be taken as examples of the former category of critics in the history of classical German philosophy. As we have already seen, they try to obliterate the "realistic" elements of Kantianism. Just as Schulze and Fichte criticised Kant himself, so the Humean empirio-criticists and the subjective idealist-immanentists criticised the German Neo-Kantians of the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 234</B></FONT><P>

second half of the nineteenth century. The line of Hume and Berkeley reappeared in a slightly renovated verbal garb. Mach and Avenarius reproached Kant not because his treatment of the thing-in-itself was not sufficiently realistic, not sufficiently materialistic, but because he <I>assumed</I> its existence; not because he refused to deduce causality and necessity in nature from objective reality, but because he assumed causality and necessity at all (except perhaps purely "logical" necessity). The immanentists were at one with the empirio-criticists, also criticising Kant from the Humean and Berkeleian standpoint. For instance, Leclair in 1879, in the work in which he praised Mach as a remarkable philosopher, reproached Kant for his "inconsistency and connivance at realism" as expressed in the concept of the "<I>thing-in-itself </I>" -- that "nominal residuum of vulgar realism" (<I>Der Realismus der modernen Naturwissenschaft</I>, <I>usw</I>., S. 9). Leclair calls materialism "vulgar realism" -- in order "to make it stronger." "In our opinion," writes Leclair, "all those parts of the Kantian theory which gravitate towards <I>realismus vulgaris</I> should be vanquished and eliminated as being inconsistencies and bastard (<I>zwitterhaft </I>) products from the idealist point of view" (p. 41). "The inconsistencies and contradictions in the Kantian theory of knowledge [arise from] the amalgamation (<I>Verquickung </I>) of idealist criticism with still unvanquished remnants of realistic dogmatism" (p. 170). By realistic dogmatism Leclair means materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Another immanentist, Johannes Rehmke, reproached Kant because he <I>realistically walled himself off</I> from Berkeley with the thing-in-itself (Johannes Rehmke, <I>Die Welt als Wahrnehmung und Begriff</I>, Berlin, 1880, S. 9). "The philosophical activity of Kant bore an essentially polemical character: with the thing-in-itself he turned against German rationalism [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 235</B></FONT><P>

the old fideism of the eighteenth century], and with pure contemplation against English empiricism" (p. 25). "I would compare the Kantian thing-in-itself with a movable lid placed over a pit: the thing looks so innocent and safe; one steps on it and suddenly falls into . . . the <I>'world-in-itself </I>'" (p. 27). That is why Kant is not liked by the associates of Mach and Avenarius, the immanentists; they do not like him because in some respects he approaches the "pit" of materialism! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And here are some examples of the criticism of Kant from the Left. Feuerbach reproaches Kant not for his "realism," but for his <I>idealism</I>, and describes his system as "idealism based on empiricism" (<I>Werke</I>, II, 296). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is a particularly important remark on Kant by Feuerbach. "Kant says: If we regard -- as we should -- the objects of our perceptions as mere appearances, we thereby admit that at the bottom of appearances is a thing-in-itself, although we do not know how it is actually constructed, but only know its appearance, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the manner in which our senses are affected (<I>affiziert </I>) by this unknown something. Hence, our reason, by the very fact that it accepts appearances, also admits the existence of things-in-themselves; and to that extent we can say that to entertain an idea of such entities which lie at the bottom of appearances, and consequently are but thought entities, is not only permissible, but unavoidable. . . ." Having selected a passage from Kant where the thing-in-itself is regarded merely as a mental thing, a thought entity, and not a real thing, Feuerbach directs his whole criticism against it. ". . . Therefore," he says, "the objects of the senses [the objects of experience] are for the mind only appearances, and not truth. . . . Yet the thought entities are not actual objects for the mind! The Kantian philosophy is a contradiction between subject and object, between entity and existence, thinking and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 236</B></FONT><P>

being. Entity is left to the mind, existence to the senses. Existence without entity [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the existence of appearances without objective reality] is mere appearance -- the sensible things -- while entity without existence is mere thought -- the thought entities, the noumena; they are thought of, but they lack existence -- at least for us -- and objectivity; they are the things-in-themselves, the true things, but they are not real things. . . . But what a contradiction, to sever truth from reality, reality from truth!" (<I>Werke</I>, II, S. 302-03). Feuerbach reproaches Kant not because he assumes things-in-themselves, but because he does not grant them reality, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., objective reality, because he regards them as mere thought, "thought entities," and not as "entities possessing existence," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., real and actually existing. Feuerbach rebukes Kant for deviating from materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The Kantian philosophy is a contradiction," Feuerbach wrote to Bolin on March 26, 1858, "it inevitably leads either to Fichtean idealism or to sensationalism." The former conclusion "belongs to the past," the latter "to the present and the future" (Gr&uumln, <I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., II, 49). We have already seen that Feuerbach advocates objective sensationalism, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialism. The new turn from Kant to agnosticism and idealism, to Hume and Berkeley, is undoubtedly <I>reactionary</I>, even from Feuerbach's standpoint. And his ardent follower, Albrecht Rau, who together with the merits of Feuerbach also adopted his faults, which were eliminated by Marx and Engels, criticised Kant wholly in the spirit of his teacher: "The Kantian philosophy is an amphibole [ambiguity]; it is both materialism and idealism, and the key to its essence lies in its dual nature. As a materialist or an empiricist, Kant cannot help conceding things an existence (<I>Wesenheit </I>) outside us. But as an idealist he could not rid himself of the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 237</B></FONT><P>

prejudice that the soul is an entity totally different from sensible things. Hence there are real things and a human mind which apprehends those things. But how can the mind approach things totally different from itself? The way out adopted by Kant is as follows: the mind possesses certain <I>a priori</I> knowledge, in virtue of which things must appear to it as they do. Hence, the fact that we understand things as we do is a fact of our creation. For the mind which lives within us is nothing but the divine mind, and just as God created the world out of nothing, so the human mind creates out of things something which they are not in themselves. Thus Kant guarantees real things their existence as 'things-in-themselves.' Kant, however, needed the soul, because immortality was for him a moral postulate. The 'thing-in-itself,' gentle men [says Rau, addressing the Neo-Kantians in general and the muddleheaded A. Lange in particular, who falsified the <I>History of Materialism </I>], is what separates the idealism of Kant from the idealism of Berkeley; it spans the gap between materialism and idealism. Such is my criticism of the Kantian philosophy, and let those who can refute it. . . ." "For the materialist a distinction between <I>a priori</I> knowledge and the 'thing-in-itself' is absolutely superfluous, for since he nowhere breaks the continuity of nature, since he does not regard matter and mind as two fundamentally different things, but as two aspects of one and the same thing, he need not resort to artifice in order to bring the mind and the thing into conjunction."*

   Further, Engels as we have seen, rebuked Kant for being an agnostic, but not for his deviation from consistent agnosticism. Lafargue, Engels' disciple, argued in 1900 against the Kantians (amongst whom at that time was Charles Rappoport) as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . At the beginning of the nineteenth century our bourgeoisie, having completed its task of revolutionary destruction, began to repudiate its Voltairean and free-thinking philosophy. Catholicism, which the master decorator Chateaubriand painted in romantic colours (<I>peinturlurait </I>), was restored to fashion, and Sebastian Mercier imported the idealism of Kant in order to give the <I>coup de gr&acircce</I> to the materialism of the Encyclopaedists, whose protagonists had been guillotined by Robespierre. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "At the end of the nineteenth century, which will go down in history as the 'bourgeois century,' the intellectuals attempted to crush the materialism of Marx and Engels beneath the philosophy of Kant. The reactionary movement started in Germany<A NAME="p238"> -- without offence to the socialist <I>integralistes </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en87">87</A>]</FONT> who would like to ascribe the honour to their chief, Malon. But Malon himself had been to the school of H&oumlchberg, Bernstein and the other disciples of D&uumlhring, who were reforming Marxism in Zurich. [Lafargue is referring to the ideological movement in German socialism in the later 'seventies.] It is to be expected that Jaur&egraves, Fourni&egravere and our other intellectuals will also treat us to Kant as soon as they have mastered his terminology. . . . Rappoport is mistaken when he assures us that for Marx the 'ideal and the real are identical.' In the first place we never employ such metaphysical phraseology. An idea is as real as the object of which it is the reflection in the brain. . . . To provide a little 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 239</B></FONT><P>

recreation for the comrades who have to acquaint themselves with bourgeois philosophy, I shall explain the substance of this famous problem which has so much exercised spiritualist minds. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The workingman who eats sausage and receives a hundred sous a day knows very well that he is robbed by the employer and is nourished by pork meat, that the employer is a robber and that the sausage is pleasant to the taste and nourishing to the body. Not at all, say the bourgeois sophists, whether they are called Pyrrho, Hume or Kant. His opinion is personal, an entirely subjective opinion; he might with equal reason maintain that the employer is his benefactor and that the sausage consists of chopped leather, for he cannot know <I>things-in-themselves</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The question is not properly put, that is the whole trouble. . . . In order to know an object, man must first verify whether his senses deceive him or not. . . . The chemists have gone still further -- they have penetrated into bodies, they have analysed them, decomposed them into their elements, and then performed the reverse procedure, they have recomposed them from their elements. And from the moment that man is able to produce things for his own use from these elements, he may, as Engels says, assert that he knows <I>the things-in-themselves</I>. The God of the Christians, if he existed and if he created the world, could do no more."* 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    We have taken the liberty of making this long quotation in order to show how Lafargue understood Engels and how he criticised Kant from the Left, not for those aspects of

Kantianism which distinguish it from Humism, but for those which are common to both Kant and Hume; not for his assumption of the thing-in-itself, but for his inadequately materialist view of it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And lastly, Karl Kautsky in his <I>Ethics</I> also criticises Kant from a standpoint diametrically opposed to that of Hume and Berkeley. "That I see green, red and white," he writes, arguing against Kant's epistemology, "is grounded in my faculty of sight. But that green is something different from red testifies to something that lies outside of me, to real differences between the things. . . . The relations and differences between the things themselves revealed to me by the individual space and time concepts . . . are real relations and differences of the external world, not conditioned by the nature of my perceptive faculty. . . . If this were really so [if Kant's doctrine of the ideality of time and space were true], we could know nothing about the world outside us, not even that it exists." (Russ. trans., pp. 33-34.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus the <I>entire school</I> of Feuerbach, Marx and Engels turned from Kant to the Left, to a complete rejection of all idealism and of all agnosticism. But our Machians followed the <I>reactionary</I> trend in philosophy, Mach and Avenarius, who criticised Kant from the standpoint of Hume and Berkeley. Of course, it is the sacred right of every citizen, and particularly of every intellectual, to follow any ideological reactionary he likes. But when people who have radically severed relations with the very <I>foundations of Marxism</I> in philosophy begin to dodge, confuse matters, hedge and assure us that they "too" are Marxists in philosophy, that they are "almost" in agreement with Marx, and have only slightly "supplemented" him -- the spectacle is a far from pleasant one.

                        2.&nbsp;HOW THE "EMPIRIO-SYMBOLIST" YUSHKEVICH<BR>
                         &nbsp;RIDICULED THE "EMPIRIO-CRITICIST" CHERNOV
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "It is, of course, amusing," writes Mr. P. Yushkevich, "to see how Mr. Chernov tries to make the agnostic positivist Comtean and Spencerian, Mikhailovsky, a forerunner of Mach and Avenarius" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 73). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   First of all, what is amusing here is Mr. Yushkevich's astonishing ignorance. Like all Voroshilovs, he conceals this ignorance under a display of erudite words and names. The passage quoted is from a paragraph devoted to the relation between Machism and Marxism. And although he undertakes to treat of this subject, Mr. Yushkevich does not know that for Engels (as for every materialist) the adherents of the Humean line and the adherents of the Kantian line are equally agnostics. Therefore, to contrast agnosticism generally with Machism, when even Mach himself confesses to being a follower of Hume, is simply to prove oneself an ignoramus in philosophy. The phrase "agnostic positivism" is also absurd, for the adherents of Hume in fact call themselves positivists. Mr. Yushkevich, who has taken Petzoldt as his teacher, should have known that Petzoldt definitely regards empirio-criticism as positivism. And finally, to drag in the names of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer is again absurd, for Marxism rejects not what distinguishes one positivist from another, but what is common to both and what makes a philosopher a positivist instead of a materialist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our Voroshilov needed this display of words so as to "mesmerise" his reader, to stun him with a cacophony of words, to distract his attention away <I>from the essence of the matter</I> to empty trifles. And the essence of the matter is the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 242</B></FONT><P>

radical difference between materialism and the broad current of positivism, which includes Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Mikhailovsky, a number of Neo-Kantians, and Mach and Avenarius. The essence of the matter has been very accurately expressed by Engels in his <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>, where he places all the Kantians and Humeans of that period (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the 'eighties of the last century) in the camp of wretched eclectics, pettifoggers (<A NAME="p242"><I>Flohknacker </I>: literally, flea-crackers), and so on.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en89">89</A>]</FONT> To whom this characterisation can and must apply is a question on which our Voroshilovs did not wish to reflect. And since they are incapable of reflecting, we shall cite one illuminating comparison. Engels,<A NAME="p242a"> speaking both in 1888 and 1892 of the Kantians and Humeans in general, mentions no names.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en90">90</A>]</FONT> The only reference Engels makes to a book is his reference to the work of Starcke on Feuerbach, which Engels analysed. "Starcke," says Engels, "takes great pains to defend Feuerbach against the attacks and doctrines of the vociferous lecturers who today go by the name of philosophers in Germany. For people who are interested in this afterbirth of German classical philosophy this is a matter of importance; for Starcke himself it may have appeared necessary. We, however, will spare the reader this" (<A NAME="p242b"><I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>, S. 25).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en91">91</A>]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Engels wanted to "spare the reader," that is, to save the Social-Democrats from a pleasant acquaintance with the degenerate chatterboxes who call themselves philosophers. And who are implied by this "afterbirth"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We open Starcke's book (C. N. Starcke, <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>, Stuttgart, 1885), and find constant references to the adherents of <I>Hume and Kant</I>. Starcke dissociates Feuerbach from these two trends. Starcke quotes in this connection 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 243</B></FONT><P>

<I>A</I>. <I>Riehl</I>, <I>Windelband and A</I>. <I>Lange</I> (pp. 3, 18-19, 127, etc., in Starcke). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We open Avenarius' <I>The Human Concept of the World</I>, which appeared in 1891, and on page 120 of the first German edition we read: "The final result of our analysis concurs -- although not absolutely (<I>durchgehend </I>) in the measure of the various points of view -- with that reached by other investigators, for example, <I>E</I>. <I>Laas</I>, <I>E</I>. <I>Mach</I>, <I>A</I>. <I>Riehl</I>, <I>W</I>. <I>Wundt</I>. See also <I>Schopenhauer</I>." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Whom was our Voroshilov-Yushkevich jeering at? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Avenarius has not the slightest doubt as to his kinship in principle -- not regarding any particular question, but regard ing the "final result" of empirio-criticism -- to the <I>Kantians</I> Riehl and Laas and to the <I>idealist</I> Wundt. He mentions Mach between the two Kantians. And, indeed, are they not all one company, since Riehl and Laas purified Kant <I>&agrave la</I> Hume, and Mach and Avenarius purified Hume <I>&agrave la</I> Berkeley? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is it surprising that Engels wished to "spare" the German workers, to save them from a close acquaintance with this whole company of "flea-cracking" university lecturers? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Engels could spare the German workers, but the Voroshilovs do not spare the Russian reader. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It should be noted that an essentially eclectic combination of Kant and Hume, or Hume and Berkeley, is possible, so to speak, in varying proportions, by laying principal stress now on one, now on another element of the mixture. We saw above, for instance, that only one Machian, H. Kleinpeter, openly admits that he and Mach are solipsists (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., consistent Berkeleians). On the other hand, the Humean trend in the views of Mach and Avenarius is emphasised by many of their disciples and followers: Petzoldt, Willy, Pearson, the Russian empirio-criticist Lessevich, the Frenchman Henri Dela-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 244</B></FONT><P>

croix<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp244">*</A>]</FONT> and others. We shall cite one example -- an especially emincllt scientist who in philosophy also combined Hume with Berkeley, but who emphasised the materialist elements of this mixture. He is Thomas Huxley, the famous English scientist, who gave currency to the term "agnostic" and whom Engels undoubtedly had chiefly and primarily in mind when he spoke of English agnosticism.<A NAME="p244"> Engels in 1892 called this type of agnostics "shamefaced materialists."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en92">92</A>]</FONT> James Ward, the English spiritualist, in his book <I>Naturalism and Agnosticism</I>, wherein he chiefly attacks the "scientific champion of agnosticism," Huxley (Vol. II, p. 229), bears out Engels' opinion when he says: "In Huxley's case indeed the leaning towards the primacy of the physical side ["series of elements" Mach calls it] is often so pronounced that it can hardly be called parallelism at all. In spite of his vehement repudiation of the title of materialist as an affront to his untarnished agnosticism, I know of few recent writers who on occasion better deserve the title" (Vol. II, pp. 30-3l). And James Ward quotes the following statements by Huxley in confirmation of his opinion: "'Anyone who is acquainted with the history of science will admit, that its progress has, in all ages, meant, and now more than ever means, the extension of the province of what we call matter and causation, and the concomitant gradual banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity.'" Or: "'It is in itself of little moment whether we express the phenomena of matter in terms of spirit, or the phenomena of spirit in terms of

Among the followers of Hume the author includes Avenarius and the immanentists in Germany, Ch. Renouvier and his school (the neo-criticists) in France.

matter -- each statement has a certain relative truth ["relatively stable complexes of elements," according to Mach]. But with a view to the progress of science, the materialistic terminology is in every way to be preferred. For it connects thought with the other phenomena of the universe. . . whereas the alternative, or spiritualistic, terminology is utterly barren, and leads to nothing but obscurity and confusion of ideas. . . . Thus there can be little doubt, that the further science advances, the more extensively and consistently will all the phenomena of Nature be represented by materialistic formulae and symbols'" (Vol. I, p. 17-19). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   So argued the "shamefaced materialist" Huxley, who refused to accept materialism, regarding it as "metaphysics" that illegitimately goes beyond "groups of sensations." And this same Huxley wrote: "'If I were obliged to choose between absolute materialism and absolute idealism I should feel compelled to accept the latter alternative. . . . Our one certainty is the existence of the mental world'" (J. Ward, Vol. II, p. 216). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Huxley's philosophy is as much a mixture of Hume and Berkeley as is Mach's philosophy. But in Huxley's case the Berkeleian streaks are incidental, and agnosticism serves as a fig-leaf for materialism. With Mach the "colouring" of the mixture is a different one, and Ward, the spiritualist, while bitterly combating Huxley, pats Avenarius and Mach affectionately on the back.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In speaking of empirio-criticism we could not avoid repeatedly mentioning the philosophers of the so-called im-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 246</B></FONT><P>

manentist school, the principal representatives of which are Schuppe, Leclair, Rehmke, and Schubert-Soldern. It is now necessary to examine the relation of empirio-criticism to the immanentists and the nature of the philosophy preached by the latter. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In 1902 Mach wrote: ". . . Today I see that a host of philosophers -- positivists, empirio-criticists, adherents of the immanentist philosophy -- as well as a very few scientists, have all, without knowing anything of each other, entered on new paths which, in spite of their individual differences, converge almost towards one point" (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 9). Here we must first note Mach's unusually frank admission that <I>very few</I> scientists are followers of the supposedly "new," but in truth very old, Humean-Berkeleian philosophy. Secondly, extremely important is Mach's opinion that this "new" philosophy is a broad <I>current</I> in which the immanentists are on the same footing as the empirio-criticists and the positivists. "Thus" -- repeats Mach in the introduction to the Russian translation of the <I>Analysis of Sensations</I> (1906) -- "there is a common movement. . ." (p. 4). "My position [Mach says in another place], moreover, borders closely on that of the representatives of the immanentist philosophy. . . . I found hardly anything in this book [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., W. Schuppe, <I>Outline of the Theory of Knowledge and Logic </I>] with which, with perhaps a very slight change, I would not gladly agree" (p. 46). Mach considers that Schubert-Soldern is also "following close paths" (p. 4), and as to Wilhelm Schuppe, Mach even <I>dedicates</I> to him his latest work, the summary so to speak of his philosophical labours, <I>Knowledge and Error</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Avenarius, the other founder of empirio-criticism, wrote in 1894 that he was "gladdened" and "encouraged" by 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 247</B></FONT><P>

Schuppe's sympathy for empirio-criticism, and that the "differences" between him and Schuppe "exist, perhaps, only temporarily" (<I>vielleicht nur einstweilen noch bestehend </I>).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp247">*</A>]</FONT> And, finally, J. Petzoldt, whose teachings Lessevich regards as the last word in empirio-criticism, <I>openly acclaims the trio</I> -- Schuppe, Mach and Avenarius -- <I>as the leaders of the "new" trend</I>. (<I>Einf&uumlhrung in die Philosophie der reinen Erfahrung</I>, Bd. II, 1904, S. 295; <I>Das Weltproblem</I>, 1906, S. v. und 146). On this point Petzoldt is definitely opposed to Willy (<I>Einf</I>., II, 321), probably the only outstanding Machian who felt ashamed of such a kinship as Schuppe's and who tried to dissociate himself from him fundamentally, for which this disciple was reprimanded by his beloved teacher Avenarius. Avenarius wrote the words about Schuppe above quoted in a comment on Willy's article against Schuppe, adding that Willy's criticism perhaps "was put more strongly than was really necessary" (<I>Vierteljahrsschrift f&uumlr wissenschaftliche Philosophie</I>, 18. Jahrg., 1894, S. 29; which also contains Willy's article against Schuppe). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Having acquainted ourselves with the empirio-criticists' opinion of the immanentists, let us examine the immanentists' opinion of the empirio-criticists. We have already mentioned the opinion uttered by Leclair in 1879. Schubert-Soldern in 1882 explicitly expressed his "agreement" "in part with the elder Fichte" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the distinguished representative of subjective idealism, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, whose son was as inept in philosophy as was the son of Joseph Dietzgen), and "with Schuppe, Leclair, <I>Avenarius</I> and partly with Rehmke," while <I>Mach</I> (<I>Die Geschichte und die Wurzel des</I>

<I>Satzes von der Erhaltung der Arbeit </I>) is cited with particular gusto in opposition to "natural-historical metaphysics"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp248">*</A>]</FONT> -- the term given to natural-historical materialism by all the reactionary university lecturers and professors in Germany. In 1893, after the appearance of Avenarius' <I>The Human Concept of the World</I>, W. Schuppe hailed this work in <I>An Open Letter to Prof</I>. <I>Avenarius</I> as a "confirmation of the na&iumlve realism" which he (Schuppe) himself advocated. "My conception of thought," Schuppe wrote, "excellently harmonises with your [Avenarius'] pure experience."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp248">**</A>]</FONT> Then, in 1896, Schubert-Soldern, summarising the "methodological trend in philosophy" on which he "bases himself," traces his genealogy from Berkeley and Hume down through F. A. Lange ("the real beginning of our movement in Germany dates from Lange"), and then through Laas, Schuppe and Co., <I>Avennrius</I> and <I>Mach</I>, <I>Riehl</I> (among the Neo-Kantians), Ch. Renouvier (among the Frenchmen), etc.*** Finally, in their programmatic "Introduction" printed in the first issue of the philosophical organ of the immanentists, alongside a declaration of war on materialism and an expression of sympathy with Charles Renouvier, we read: "Even in the camp of the scientists themselves voices of individual thinkers are being raised sermonising against the growing arrogance

of their colleagues, against the unphilosophical spirit which has taken possession of the natural sciences. Thus the physicist Mach. . . .

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A word or two about Ch. Renouvier. He is the head of the influential and widespread school in France known as the neo-criticists. His theoretical philosophy is a combination of the phenomenalism of Hume and the apriorism of Kant. The thing-in-itself is absolutely rejected. The connection of phenomena, order and law is declared to be <I>a priori </I>; law is written with a capital letter and is converted into the basis of religion. The Catholic priests go into raptures over this philosophy. The Machian Willy scornfully refers to Renouvier as a "second apostle Paul," as "an obscurantist of the first water" and as a "casuistic preacher of free will" (<I>Gegen die Schulweisheit</I>, S. 129). And it is such co-thinkers of the immanentists who <I>warmly greet</I><A NAME="p249"> Mach's philosophy. When his <I>Mechanics</I> appeared in a French translation,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en94">94</A>]</FONT> the organ of the neo-criticists -- <I>L'Ann&eacutee philosophique</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en95">95</A>]</FONT> -- edited by Pillon, a collaborator and disciple of Renouvier, wrote: "It is unnecessary to speak of the extent to which, in this criticism of substance, the thing, the thing-in-itself, Mach's positive science agrees with neo-critical idealism" (Vol. XV, 1904, p. 179). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As for the Russian Machians, they are all ashamed of their kinship with the immanentists, and one of course could not expect anything else of people who did not deliberately

Bazarov alone refers to "certain representatives of the immanentist school" as "realists."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp250">*</A>]</FONT> Bogdanov briefly (<I>and in fact falsely </I>) declares that "the immanentist school is only an intermediate form between Kantianism and empirio-criticism" (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, p. xxii). V. Chernov writes: "Generally speaking, the immanentists approach positivism in only one aspect of their theory, in other aspects they go far beyond it" (<I>Philosophical and Sociological Studies</I>, p. 37). Valentinov says that "the immanentist school clothed these [Machian] ideas in an unsuitable form and found themselves in the blind alley of solipsism" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 149). As you see, you pay your money and take your choice: constitution and salmon mayonnaise, realism and solipsism. Our Machians are afraid to tell the plain and clear truth about the immanentists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The fact is that the immanentists are rank reactionaries, I open advocates of fideism, unadulterated in their obscurantism. There is <I>not one</I> of them who has not <I>frankly</I> made his more theoretical works on epistemology a defence of religion and a justification of medievalism of one kind or another. Leclair, in 1879, advocated his philosophy as one that satisfies "all the needs of a religiously inclined mind" (<I>Der Realismus</I>, <I>etc</I>., S. 73). J. Rehmke, in 1880, dedicated his "theory of knowledge" to the Protestant pastor Biedermann and closed his book by preaching not a supersensible God, but God as a "real concept" (it was for this reason

presumably, that Bazarov ranked "certain" immanentists among the "realists"?), and moreover the "objectivisation of this real concept is relegated to practical life," while Biedermann's "Christian dogmatism" is declared to be a model of "scientific theology" (J. Rehmke, <I>Die Welt als Wahrnehmung und Begriff</I>, Berlin, 1880, S. 312). Schuppe in the <I>Zeitschrift f&uumlr immanente Philosophie</I> assures us that though the immanentists deny the transcendental, God and the future life do not come under this concept (<I>Zeitschrift f&uumlr immanente Philosophie</I>, II.

In his <I>Ethik</I> he insists on the "connection of the moral law . . . with the metaphysical world conception" and condemns the separation of the church from the state as a "senseless phrase" (Dr. Wilhelm Schuppe, <I>Grundz&uumlge der Ethik und Rechtsphilosophie</I> [<I>Principles of Ethics and the Philosophy of Law </I>], Breslau, 1881, S. 181, 325). Schubert-Soldern in his <I>Grundlage einer Erkenntnistheorie</I> deduces both the pre-existence of the self before the body and the after-existence of the <I>self</I><A NAME="p251"> after the body, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the immortality of the soul (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 82), etc. In <I>The Social Question</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en96">96</A>]</FONT> arguing against Bebel, he defends, together with "social reforms," suffrage based on class distinction, and says that the "Social-Democrats ignore the fact that without the divine gift of unhappiness there could be no happiness" (p. 330), and thereupon laments the fact that materialism "prevails" (p. 242): "he who in our time believes in a life beyond, or even in its possibility, is considered a fool" (<I>ibid</I>.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And German Menshikovs like these, no less obscurantists of the first water than Renouvier, live in lasting concubinage with the empirio-criticists. Their theoretical kinship is in contestable. There is no more Kantianism in the immanentists than in Petzoldt or Pearson. We saw above that they 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 252</B></FONT><P>

themselves regard themselves as disciples of Hume and Berkeley, an opinion of the immanentists that is generally recognised in philosophical literature. In order to show clearly what epistemological premises these comrades-in-arms of Mach and Avenarius proceed from, we shall quote some fundamental theoretical propositions from the works of im manentists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Leclair in 1879 had not yet invented the term "immanent," which really signifies "experiential," "given in experience," and which is just as spurious a label for concealing corruption as the labels of the European bourgeois parties. In his first work, Leclair frankly and explicitly calls himself a "<I>critical idealist </I>" (<I>Der Realismus</I>, <I>etc</I>., S. 11, 21, 206, etc.). In this work he criticises Kant, as we have already seen, for his concessions to materialism, and clearly indicates his <I>wn</I> path <I>away from</I> Kant to Fichte and Berkeley. Leclair fights materialism in general and <I>the tendency towards materialism displayed by the majority of scientists</I> in particular as mercilessly as Schuppe, Schubert-Soldern and Rehmke. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "If we return," Leclair says, "to the standpoint of critical idealism, if we do not attribute a transcendental existence [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., an existence outside of human consciousness] to nature or the processes of nature, then for the subject the aggregate of bodies and his own body, in so far as he can see and feel it, together with all its changes, will be a directly given phenomenon of spatially connected co-existences and successions in time, and the whole explanation of nature will reduce itself to stating the laws of these co-existences and successions" (p. 21). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Back to Kant! -- said the reactionary Neo-Kantians. Back to Fichte and Berkeley! -- is <I>essentially</I> what the reactionary immanentists are saying. For Leclair, all that exists consists 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 253</B></FONT><P>

of "<I>complexes of sensations </I>" (p. 38), while certain classes of properties (<I>Eigenschaften </I>), which act upon our sense-organs, he designates, for example, by the letter M, and other classes, which act upon other objects of nature, by the letter N (p. 150, etc.). Moreover, Leclair speaks of nature as the "phenomena of the consciousness" (Bewusstseinsph&aumlnomen) not of a single person, but of "mankind" (pp. 55-56). If we remember that Leclair published his book in Prague, where Mach was professor of physics,<A NAME="p253"> and that Leclair cites with rapture only Mach's <I>Erhaltung der Arbeit</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en97">97</A>]</FONT> which appeared in 1872, the question involuntarily arises: ought we not to regard the advocate of fideism and frank idealist Leclair as the true progenitor of the "original" philosophy of Mach? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    As for Schuppe, who, according to Leclair,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp253">*</A>]</FONT> arrived at the "same results," he, as we have seen, really claims to defend "na&iumlve realism," and in his <I>Open Letter to Prof</I>. <I>Avenarius</I> bitterly complains of the "established perversion of my [Schuppe's] theory of knowledge to subjective idealism." The true nature of the crude forgery which the immanentist Schuppe calls a defence of realism is quite clear from his rejoinder to Wundt, who did not hesitate to class the immanentists with the Fichteans, the subjective idealists (<I>Philosophische Studien</I>, <I>loc</I>. <I>cit</I>., S. 386, 397, 407). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "In my case," Schuppe <I>retorts</I> to Wundt, "the proposition 'being is consciousness' means that consciousness without the external world is inconceivable, that the latter belongs to the former, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the absolute connection (<I>Zusammengeh&oumlrigkeit </I>) of the one with the other, which I have so often asserted

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    One must be extremely na&iumlve not to discern unadulterated subjective idealism in such "realism"! Just think: the external world "belongs to consciousness" and is in <I>absolute</I> connection with it! The poor professor was indeed slandered by the "established" practice of ranking him with the subjective idealists! Such a philosophy completely coincides with Avenarius' "principal co-ordination"; no reservations and protests on the part of Chernov and Valentinov can sunder them; both philosophies will be consigned together to the museum of reactionary fabrications of German professordom. As a curiosity once more testifying to Valentinov's lack of judgment, let us note that he calls Schuppe a solipsist (it goes without saying that Schuppe vowed and swore that he was not a solipsist -- and wrote special articles to this effect  -- just as vehemently as did Mach, Petzoldt, and Co.), yet is highly delighted with Bazarov's article in the <I>Studies </I>! I should like to translate into German Bazarov's dictum that "sense-perception is the reality existing outside us" and forward it to some more or less intelligent immanentist. He would embrace and kiss Bazarov as heartily as the Schuppes, Leclairs and Schubert-Solderns embraced Mach and Avenarius. For Bazarov's dictum is the <I>alpha and omega</I> of the doctrines of the immanentist school. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And here, lastly, is Schubert-Soldern. "The materialism of natural science," the "metaphysics" of recognising the objective reality of the external world, is the chief enemy of

this philosopher (<I>Grundlagen einer Erkenntnistheorie</I>, 1884, p. 31 and the whole of Chapter II: "The Metaphysics of Natural Science"). "Natural science abstracts from all relations of consciousness" (p. 52) -- that is the chief evil (and that is just what constitutes materialism!). For the individual cannot escape from "sensations and, hence, from a state of consciousness" (pp. 33-34). Of course, Schubert-Soldern admitted in 1896, my standpoint is <I>epistemological solipsism</I> (<I>Die soziale Frage</I>, S. x), but not "metaphysical," not "practical" solipsism. "What is given us immediately is sensations, complexes of constantly changing sensations" (<I>Ueber Transcendenz des Objekts und Subjekts</I>, S. 73). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Marx took the material process of production," says Schubert-Soldern, "as the cause of inner processes and motives, in the same way (and just as falsely) as natural science regards the common [to humanity] external world as the cause of the individual inner worlds" (<I>Die soziale Frage</I>, S. xviii). That Marx's historical materialism is connected with natural-historical materialism and philosophical materialism in general, it does not even occur to this comrade in-arms of Mach to doubt. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Many, perhaps the majority, will be of the opinion that from the standpoint of epistemological solipsism no metaphysics is possible, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., that metaphysics is always transcendental. Upon more mature reflection I cannot concur with this opinion. Here are my reasons. . . . The immediate foundation of all that is given is the spiritual (solipsist) connection, the central point of which is the individual <I>self</I> (the individual realm of thought) with its body. The rest of the world is inconceivable without this <I>self</I>, just as this <I>self</I> is inconceivable without the rest of the world. With the destruction of the individual <I>self</I> the world is also anni-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 256</B></FONT><P>

hilated, which appears impossible -- and with the destruction of the rest of the world, nothing remains for my individual <I>self</I>, for the latter can be separated from the world only logically, but not in time and space. Therefore my individual <I>self</I> must continue to exist after my death also, if the entire world is not to be annihilated with it. . ." (<I>ibid</I>., p. xxiii). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "principal co-ordination," "complexes of sensations" and the rest of the Machian banalities render faithful service to the proper people! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . What is the hereafter (<I>das Jenseits </I>) from the solipsist point of view? It is only a possible future experience for me. . ." (<I>ibid</I>.). "Spiritualism . . . would be obliged to prove the existence of the Jenseits. But at any rate the materialism of natural science cannot be brought into the field against spiritualism, for this materialism, as we have seen, is only one aspect of the world process within the all-embracing spiritual connection" ( = the "principal co-ordination") (p. xxiv). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All this is said in that philosophical introduction to <I>Die soziale Frage</I> (1896) wherein Schubert-Soldern <I>all the time</I> appears arm in arm with Mach and Avenarius. Only for the handful of Russian Machians does Machism serve exclusively for purposes of intellectual prattle. In its native country its role as a flunkey to fideism is openly proclaimed!

                         4.&nbsp;WHITHER IS EMPIRIO-CRITICISM TENDING?
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Let us now cast a glance at the development of Machism after Mach and Avenarius. We have seen that their philosophy is a hash, a pot-pourri of contradictory and disconnected epistemological propositions. We must now examine how and whither, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., in what direction, this philosophy is 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 257</B></FONT><P>

developing, for this will help us to settle certain "disputable" questions by referring to indisputable historical facts. And indeed, in view of the eclecticism and incoherence of the initial philosophical premises of the trend we are examining, varying interpretations of it and sterile disputes over particulars and trifles are absolutely inevitable. But empirio-criticism, like every ideological current, is a living thing, which grows and develops, and the fact that it is growing in one direction or another will help us more than long arguments to settle the <I>basic</I> question as to what the real essence of this philosophy is. We judge a person not by what he says or thinks of himself but by his actions. And we must judge philosophers not by the labels they give themselves ("positivism," the philosophy of "pure experience," "monism" or "empirio-monism," the "philosophy of natural science," etc.) but by the manner in which they actually settle fundamental theoretical questions, by their associates, by what they are teaching and by what they have taught their disciples and followers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is this last question which interests us now. Everything essential was said by Mach and Avenarius more than twenty years ago. It was bound to become clear in the interval <I>how</I> these "leaders" were <I>understood</I> by those who wanted to understand them, and whom they themselves (at least Mach, who has outlived his colleague) regard as their successors. To be specific, let us take those who themselves claim to be disciples of Mach and Avenarius (or their adherents) and whom Mach himself ranks as such. We shall thus obtain a picture of empirio-criticism as a philosophical <I>current</I>, and not as a collection of literary oddities. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In Mach's Introduction to the Russian translation of the <I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, Hans Cornelius is recommended as 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 258</B></FONT><P>

a "young investigator" who is following "if not quite the same, at least very close paths" (p. 4). In the text of the <I>Analysis of Sensations</I> Mach once again "mentions with pleasure the works" of Cornelius and others, "who have disclosed the kernel of Avenarius' ideas and have developed them further" (p. 48). Let us take Cornelius' <I>Einleitung in die Philosophie</I> [<I>Introduction to Philosophy </I>] (Germ. ed., 1903) and we find that its author also speaks of his endeavour to follow in the footsteps of Mach and Avenarius (pp. viii, 32). We have before us then a <I>disciple acknowledged by the teacher</I>. This disciple also begins with sensations-elements (pp. 17, 24), categorically declares that he confines himself to experience (p. vi), calls his views "consistent or epistemological empiricism" (p. 335), emphatically condemns the "one sidedness" of idealism and the "dogmatism" of both the idealists and the materialists (p. 129), vehemently denies the possible "misconception" (p. 123) that his philosophy implies the recognition of the world as existing in the mind of man, flirts with na&iumlve realism no less skilfully than Avenarius, Schuppe or Bazarov ("a visual, as well as every other sense perception, is located where we find it, and only where we find it, that is to say, where the na&iumlvena&iumlve mind, untouched by a false philosophy, localises it" -- p. 125) -- and this disciple, acknowledged as such by his teacher, arrives at <I>immortality</I> and <I>God</I>. Materialism -- thunders this police sergeant in a professorial chair, I beg your pardon, this disciple of the "recent positivists" -- converts man into an automaton. "It need hardly be said that together with the belief in the freedom of our decisions it destroys all considerations of the moral value of our actions and our responsibility for them. Just as little room is left for the idea of the continuation of our life after death" (p. 116). The final note of the book is: 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 259</B></FONT><P>

Education (or the youth stultified by this man of science presumably) is necessary not only for action but "above all . . . to inculcate veneration (<I>Ehrfurcht </I>) not for the transitory values of a fortuitous tradition, but for the imperishable values of duty and beauty, for the divine (<I>dem G&oumlttlichen </I>) within us and without" (p. 357). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Compare this with Bogdanov's assertion that "there is <I>absolutely no room </I>" (Bogdanov's italics) and "there cannot be any room" for the idea of God, freedom of the will and immortality of the soul in Mach's philosophy in view of his denial of every "thing-in-itself" (p. xii). While Mach in this same book (p. 293) declares that "there is no Machian philosophy," and recommends not only the immanentists, but also Cornelius who had disclosed the kernel of Avenarius' ideas! Thus, in the first place, Bogdanov <I>absolutely does not know</I> the "Machian philosophy" as a current which not only nestles under the wing of fideism, but which itself goes to the length of fideism. In the second place, Bogdanov <I>absolutely does not know</I> the history of philosophy; for to associate a denial of the ideas mentioned above with a denial of the thing-in-itself is to insult the history of philosophy. Will Bogdanov take it into his head to deny that all consistent followers of Hume, by rejecting every kind of thing-in-itself, <I>do leave room</I> for these ideas? Has Bogdanov never heard of the subjective idealists, who reject every kind of thing in-itself and thereby make room for these ideas? "There can be no room" for these ideas <I>solely</I> in a philosophy that teaches that nothing exists but perceptual being, that the world is matter in motion, that the external world, the physical world familiar to all, is the sole objective reality -- <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., in the philosophy of materialism. And it is for this, precisely for this, that materialism is combated by the immanentists 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 260</B></FONT><P>

recommended by Mach, by Mach's disciple Cornelius, and by modern professorial philosophy in general. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our Machians began to repudiate Cornelius only after this indecency had been pointed out to them. Such repudiations are not worth much. Friedrich Adler evidently has not been "warned," and therefore recommends this Cornelius in a socialist journal (<I>Der Kampf</I>, 1908, 5, S. 235: "a work that is easy to read and highly to be commended"). Through the medium of Machism, downright philosophical reactionaries and preachers of fideism are palmed off on the workers as teachers! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Petzoldt, without having been warned, detected the falsity in Cornelius: but his method of combating this falsity is a gem. Listen to this: "To assert that the world is idea [as is asserted by the idealists -- whom we are combating, no joke!] has sense only when it implies that it is the idea of the predicator, or, if you like, of all predicators, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., that its existence depends exclusively upon the thought of that individual or of those individuals; it exists only inasmuch as he thinks about it, and what he does not think of does not exist. We, on the contrary, make the world dependent not upon the thought of an individual or individuals, or, to put it better and clearer, not upon the act of thinking, or upon any actual thought, but -- and exclusively in the logical sense -- upon thought in general. The idealist confuses one with the other, and the result is agnostic semi-solipsism, as we observe it in Cornelius" (<I>Einf&uumlhrung</I>, II, 317). 
<A NAME="p260">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Stolypin denied the existence of the <I>cabinets noirs </I>!<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en98">98</A>]</FONT> Petzoldt annihilates the idealists! It is truly astonishing how much this annihilation of idealism resembles a recommendation to the idealists to exercise more skill in concealing their idealism. To say that the world depends upon man's 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 261</B></FONT><P>

thought is perverted idealism. To say that the world depends upon thought in general is recent positivism, critical realism -- in a word, thoroughgoing bourgeois charlatanism! If Cornelius is an agnostic semi-solipsist, Petzoldt is a solipsist semi-agnostic. You are cracking a flea, gentlemen! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us proceed. In the second edition of his <I>Erkenntnis und Irrtum</I>, Mach says: "A systematic exposition [of Mach's views], one to which in all its essentials I can subscribe, is given by Professor Dr. Hans Kleinpeter" (<I>Die Erkenntnistheorie der Naturforschung der Gegenwart</I>, Leipzig, 1905: <I>The Theory of Knowledge of Modern Natural Science </I>). Let us take Hans Number Two. This professor is an accredited disseminator of Machism: a pile of articles on Mach's views in philosophical journals, both in German and in English, translations of works recommended by Mach with introductions by Mach -- in a word, the right hand of the "teacher." Here are his views: ". . . All my (outer and inner) experience, all my thoughts and aspirations are given me as a psychical process, as a part of my consciousness" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>. p. 18). "That which we call physical is a construction of psychical elements" (p. 144). "<I>Subjective conviction</I>, <I>not objective certainty</I> (<I>Gewissheit </I>) <I>is the only attainable goal of any science </I>" (p. 9). (The italics are Kleinpeter's, who adds the following remark: "Something similar was already said by Kant in the <I>Critique of Practical Reason</I>.") "The assumption that there are other minds is one which can never be confirmed by experience" (p. 42). "I do not know. . . whether, in general, there exist other <I>selves</I> outside of myself" (p. 43). In &#167; 5, entitled "Activity (Spontaneity) in Consciousness," we read that in the case of the animal-automaton the succession of ideas is purely mechanical. The same is true of us when we dream. "The quality of our consciousness 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 262</B></FONT><P>

in its normal state essentially differs from this. It possesses a property which these [the automata] entirely lack, and which it would be very difficult, to say the least, to explain mechanically or automatically: the so-called self-activity of the <I>self</I>. Every person can dissever himself from his states of consciousness, he can manipulate them, can make them stand out more clearly or force them into the background, can analyse them, compare various parts, etc. All this is a fact of (immediate) experience. Our <I>self</I> is therefore essentially different from the sum-total of the states of consciousness and cannot be put as an equivalent of it. Sugar consists of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen; were we to attribute a soul to it, then by analogy it would have to possess the faculty of directing the movement of the hydrogen, oxygen and carbon at will" (pp. 29-30). &#167; 4 of the following chapter is headed: "The Act of Cognition -- an Act of Will (<I>Willenshandlung </I>)." "It must be regarded as definitely established that all my psychical experiences are divisible into two large main groups: compulsory acts and deliberate acts. To the former belong all impressions of the external world" (p. 47). "That it is possible to advance several theories regarding one and the same realm of facts . . . is as well known to physicists as it is incompatible with the premises of an absolute theory of knowledge. And this fact is also linked with the volitional character of our thought; it also implies that our volition is not bound by external circumstances" (p. 50). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Now judge how bold Bogdanov was in asserting that in Mach's philosophy "there is absolutely no room for free will," when Mach himself recommends such a specimen as Kleinpeter! We have already seen that the latter does not attempt to conceal either his own idealism or Mach's. In 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 263</B></FONT><P>

1898-99 Kleinpeter wrote: "Hertz proclaims the same subjectivist view [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., as Mach] of the nature of our concepts. . . . If Mach and Hertz [with what justice Kleinpeter here implicates the famous physicist we shall soon see] deserve credit from the standpoint of idealism for having emphasised the subjective origin of <I>all</I> our concepts and of the connections between them -- and not only of certain individual ones -- from the standpoint of empiricism they deserve no less credit for having acknowledged that experience alone, as a court entirely independent of thought, can solve the question of their correctness" (<I>Archiv f&uumlr systematische Philosophie</I>, Bd. V, 1898-99, S. 169-70). In 1900 he wrote that in spite of all the points on which Mach differs from Kant and Berkeley, "they at any rate are more akin to him than the metaphysical empiricism prevailing in natural science [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialism! The professor does not like to call the devil by name] which is indeed the main target of Mach's attacks" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., Bd. VI, S. 87). In 1903 he wrote: "The starting point of Berkeley and Mach is irrefutable. . . . Mach completed what Kant began" (<I>Kantstudien</I>, Bd. VIII, 1903, S. 314, 274). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In the preface to the Russian edition of the <I>Analysis of Sensations</I> Mach also mentions T. Ziehen, "who is following, if not the same, at least very close paths." We take Professor Theodor Ziehen's book <I>The Psychophysiological Theory of Knowledge</I> (<I>Psychophysiologische Erkenntnistheorie</I>, Jena, 1898) and hnd that the author refers to Mach, Avenarius, Schuppe, and so forth in the very introduction. Here therefore we again have a case of a disciple acknowledged by the teacher. Ziehen's "recent" theory is that only the "mob" is capable of believing that "real objects evoke our sensations" (p. 3), and that "over the portals of the theory 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 264</B></FONT><P>

of knowledge there can be no other inscription than the words of Berkeley: 'The external objects subsist not by themselves, but exist in our minds!'" (p. 5). "What is given us is sensations and ideas. Both are embraced by the word psychical. Non-psychical is a word devoid of meaning" (p. 100). The laws of nature are relations not of material bodies but of "reduced sensations" (p. 104. This "new" concept -- "reduced sensations" -- contains everything that is original in Ziehen's Berkeleianismt). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Petzoldt repudiated Ziehen as an idealist as far back as 1904 in the second volume of his <I>Introduction</I> (S. 298-301). By 1906 he had already included Cornelius, Kleinpeter, Ziehen and Verworn (<I>Das Weltproblem</I>, <I>etc</I>., S. 137 Fussnote) in the list of <I>idealists or psychomonists</I>. In the case of all these worthy professors, you see, there is a "misconception" in their interpretations "of the views of Mach and Avenarius" (ibid .). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Poor Mach and Avenarius! Not only were they slandered by their enemies for idealism and "even" (as Bogdanov expresses it) solipsism, but their very friends, disciples and followers, expert professors, also understood their teachers pervertedly, in an idealist sense. If empirio-criticism is developing into idealism, that by no means demonstrates the radical falsity of its muddled Berkeleian basic premises. God forbid!<A NAME="p264"> It is only a slight "misconception," in the Nozdriev-Petzoldt</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en99">99</A>]</FONT> sense of the term. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The funniest thing of all perhaps is that Petzoldt himself, the guardian of purity and innocence, firstly, "supplemented" Mach and Avenarius with his "logical <I>a priori </I>" and, secondly, coupled them with Wilhelm Schuppe, the vehicle of fideism. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 265</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Had Petzoldt been acquainted with Mach's English adherents he would have had very considerably to extend the list of Machians who had lapsed (because of a "misconception") into idealism. We have already referred to Karl Pearson, whom Mach praised, as an unadulterated idealist. Here are the opinions of two other "slanderers" who say the same thing of Pearson: "Professor Pearson is merely echoing a doctrine first given clear utterance by the truly great Berkeley" (Howard V. Knox, <I>Mind</I>, Vol. VI, 1897, p. 205). "There can be no doubt that Mr. Pearson is an idealist in the strictest sense of the word" (Georges Rodier, <I>Revue philosophique</I>, 1888, II, Vol. 26, p. 200). The English idealist, William Clifford, whom Mach regards as "coming very close" to his philosophy (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 8), must be considered a teacher rather than a disciple of Mach, for Clifford's philosophical works appeared in the 'seventies. Here the "misconception" is due to Mach himself, who in 1901 "failed to notice" the idealism in Clifford's doctrine that the world is "mind-stuff," a "social object," a "highly organised experience," and so forth.* For a characterisation of the charlatanism of the German Machians, it is sufficient to note that Kleinpeter in 1905 elevated this idealist to the rank of founder of the "epistemology of modern science"!

When Haeckel issued his theses for a Monistic Alliance, Carus vigorously opposed him on the ground that, first, Haeckel vainly attempts to refute apriorism, which is "quite in keeping with scientific philosophy"; second, that Haeckel's doctrine of determinism "excludes the possibility of free will"; third, that Haeckel is mistaken "in emphasising the one-sided view of the naturalist against the traditional conservatism of the churches.

                                  5.&nbsp;A. BOGDANOV'S "EMPIRIO-MONISM"
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "I personally," writes Bogdanov of himself, "know so far of only one empirio-monist in literature -- a certain A. Bogdanov. But I know him very well and can answer for it that his views fully accord with the sacramental formula of the primacy of nature over mind. To wit, he regards all that exists as a continuous chain of development, the lower links of which are lost in the chaos of elements, while the higher links, known to us, represent the <I>experience of men</I> [Bogdanov's italics] -- psychical and, still higher, physical experience. This experience, and the knowledge 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 268</B></FONT><P>

resulting therefrom, correspond to what is usually called mind" (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, III, xii). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "sacramental" formula here ridiculed by Bogdanov is the well-known proposition of Engels, whom Bogdanov, however, diplomatically avoids mentioning! We do not differ from Engels, oh, no! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But let us examine more carefully Bogdanov's own summary of his famous "empirio-monism" and "substitution." The physical world is called the <I>experience of men</I> and it is declared that physical experience is "<I>higher </I>" in the chain of development than psychical. But this is utter nonsense! And it is precisely the kind of nonsense that is characteristic of all idealist philosophies. It is simply farcical for Bogdanov to class this "system" as materialism. With me, too, he says, nature is primary and mind secondary. If Engels' definition is to be thus construed, then Hegel is also a materialist, for with him, too, psychical experience (under the title of the Absolute Idea) comes first, then follow, "higher up," the physical world, nature, and, lastly, human knowledge, which through nature apprehends the Absolute Idea. Not a single idealist will deny the primacy of nature taken in this sense for it is not a genuine primacy, since in fact nature is not taken as the <I>immediately</I> given, as the starting point of epistemology. Nature is in fact reached as the result of a long process <I>through abstraction</I> of the "psychical." It is immaterial what these abstractions are called: whether Absolute Idea, Universal Self, World Will, and so on and so forth. These terms distinguish the different varieties of idealism, and such varieties exist in countless numbers. The essence of idealism is that the psychical is taken as the starting point; from it external nature is deduced, <I>and only then</I> is the ordinary human consciousness deduced from nature. Hence, this primary 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 269</B></FONT><P>

"psychical" always turns out to be a <I>lifeless abstraction</I> concealing a diluted theology. For instance, everybody knows what a human <I>idea</I> is; but an idea independent of man and prior to man, an idea in the abstract, an Absolute Idea, is a theological invention of the idealist Hegel. Everybody knows what human sensation is; but sensation independent of man, sensation prior to man, is nonsense, a lifeless abstraction, an idealist artifice. And it is precisely to such an idealistic artifice that Bogdanov resorts when he erects the following ladder. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    1)&nbsp;The chaos of "elements" (we know that no other human concept lies back of the term "element" save sensation). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    2)&nbsp;The psychical experience of men. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    3)&nbsp;The physical experience of men. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    4)&nbsp;"The knowledge emerging therefrom." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There are no sensations (human) without man. Hence, the first rung of this ladder is a lifeless idealist abstraction. As a matter of fact, what we have here is not the usual and familiar <I>human</I> sensations, but fictitious sensations, <I>nobody's</I> sensations, sensations <I>in general</I>, divine sensations -- just as the ordinary human idea became divine with Hegel when it was divorced from man and man's brain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   So away with the first rung! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Away also with the second rung, for the <I>psychical before</I> the physical (and Bogdanov places the second rung <I>before</I> the third) is something unknown to man or science. The physical realm existed before the psychical could have appeared, for the latter is the highest product of the highest forms of organic matter. Bogdanov's second rung is also a lifeless abstraction, it is thought without brain, human reason divorced from man. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 270</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Only when we throw out the hrst two rungs, and only then, can we obtain a picture of the world that truly corresponds to science and materialism. To wit: 1) the physical world exists <I>independently</I> of the mind of man and existed long <I>prior to</I> man, <I>prior to</I> any "human experience"; 2) the psychical, the mind, etc., is the highest product of matter (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the physical), it is a function of that particularly complex fragment of matter called the human brain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The realm of substitution," writes Bogdanov, "coincides with the realm of physical phenomena; for the psychical phenomena we need substitute nothing, because they are immediate complexes" (p. xxxix). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And this precisely is idealism; for the psychical, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., consciousness, idea, sensation, etc., is taken as the <I>immediate</I> and the physical is deduced from it, substituted for it. The world is the <I>non-ego</I> created by the <I>ego</I>, said Fichte. The world is absolute idea, said Hegel. The world is will, said Schopenhauer. The world is conception and idea, says the immanentist Rehmke. Being is consciousness, says the immanentist Schuppe. The physical is a substitution for the psychical, says Bogdanov. One must be blind not to perceive the identical idealist essence under these various verbal cloaks. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Let us ask ourselves the following question," writes Bogdanov in Book I of <I>Empirio-Monism</I> (pp. 128-29): "What is a 'living being,' for instance, 'man'?" And he answers: "'Man' is primarily a definite complex of 'immediate experiences.' [Mark, "<I>primarily </I>"!] <I>Then</I>, in the further development of experience, 'man' becomes both for himself and for others a physical body amidst other physical bodies." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Why, this is a sheer "complex" of absurdities, fit only for deducing the immortality of the soul, or the idea of God, and so forth. Man is primarily a complex of immediate expe-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 271</B></FONT><P>

riences and in the course of <I>further development</I> becomes a physical body! That means that there are "immediate experiences" <I>without</I> a physical body, <I>prior to</I> a physical body! What a pity that this magnificent philosophy has not yet found acceptance in our theological seminaries! There its merits would have been fully appreciated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . We have admitted that physical nature itself is a <I>product</I> [Bogdanov's italics] of complexes of an immediate character (to which psychical co-ordinations also belong), that it is the reflection of such complexes in others, analogous to them, but of the most complex type (in the socially organised experience of living beings)" (p. 146). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A philosophy which teaches that physical nature itself is a product, is a philosophy of the priests pure and simple. And its character is in no wise altered by the fact that personally Bogdanov emphatically repudiates all religion. D&uumlhring was also an atheist; he even proposed to prohibit religion in his "socialitarian" order. Nevertheless, Engels was absolutely right in pointing out that D&uumlhring's "system" could not make ends meet without religion. The same is true of Bogdanov, with the essential difference that the quoted passage is not a chance inconsistency but the very essence of his "empirio-monism" and of all his "substitution." If nature is a product, it is obvious that it can be a product only of some thing that is greater, richer, broader, mightier than nature, of something that exists; for in order to "produce" nature, it must exist independently of nature. That means that something exists <I>outside</I> nature, something which moreover <I>produces</I> nature. In plain language this is called God. The idealist philosophers have always sought to change this latter name, to make it more abstract, more vague and at the same time (for the sake of plausibility) to bring it nearer to the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 272</B></FONT><P>

"psychical," as an "immediate complex," as the immediately given which requires no proof. Absolute Idea, Universal Spirit, World Will, "<I>general substitution </I>" of the psychical for the physical, are different formulations of one and the same idea. Every man knows, and science investigates, idea, mind, will, the psychical, as a function of the normally operating human brain. To divorce this function from substance organised in a definite way, to convert this function into a universal, general abstraction, to "substitute" this abstraction for the whole of physical nature, this is the raving of philosophical idealism and a mockery of science. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Materialism says that the "socially-organised experience of living beings" is a product of physical nature, a result of a long development of the latter, a development from a state of physical nature when no society, organisation, experience, or living beings existed or could have existed. Idealism says that physical nature is a product of this experience of living beings, and in saying this, idealism is equating (if not subordinating) nature to God. For God is undoubtedly a product of the socially-organised experience of living beings. No matter from what angle you look at it, Bogdanov's philosophy contains nothing but a reactionary muddle. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov thinks that to speak of the social organisation of experience is "cognitive socialism" (Bk. III, p. xxxiv). This is insane twaddle. If socialism is thus regarded, the Jesuits are ardent adherents of "cognitive socialism," for the basis of their epistemology is divinity as "socially-organised experience." And there can be no doubt that Catholicism is a socially-organised experience; only, it reflects not objective truth (which Bogdanov denies, but which science reflects), but the exploitation of the ignorance of the masses by definite social classes. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 273</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  But why speak of the Jesuits! We find Bogdanov's "cognitive socialism" in its entirety among the immanentists, so beloved of Mach. Leclair regards nature as the consciousness of "mankind" (<I>Der Realismus</I>, <I>etc</I>., S. 55), and not of the individual. The bourgeois philosophers will serve you up any amount of such Fichtean cognitive socialism. Schuppe also emphasises <I>das generische</I>, <I>das gattungsm&aumlssige Moment des Bewusstseins</I> (<I>Vierteljahrsschrift f&uumlr wissenschaftliche Philosophie</I>, Bd. XVII, S. 379-80), <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the general, the generic factor of consciousness. To think that philosophical idealism vanishes when the consciousness of mankind is substituted for the consciousness of the individual, or the socially-organised experience for the experience of one person, is like thinking that capitalism vanishes when one capitalist is replaced by a joint-stock company. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our Russian Machians, Yushkevich and Valentinov, echo the materialist Rakhmetov in asserting that Bogdanov is an idealist (at the same time foully abusing Rakhmetov himself). But they could not stop to think where this idealism came from. They make out that Bogdanov is an individual and chance phenomenon, an isolated case. This is not true. Bogdanov personally may think that he has invented an "original" system, but one has only to compare him with the afore mentioned disciples of Mach to realise the falsity of such an opinion. The difference between Bogdanov and Cornelius is far less than the difference between Cornelius and Carus. The difference between Bogdanov and Carus is less (as far as their philosophical systems are concerned, of course, and not the deliberateness of their reactionary implications) than the difference between Carus and Ziehen, and so on. Bogdanov is only one of the manifestations of that "socially-organised experience" which testifies to the growth of Machism into 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 274</B></FONT><P>

idealism. Bogdanov (we are here, of course, speaking exclusively of Bogdanov as a philosopher) could not have come into God's world had the doctrines of his teacher Mach contained no "elements". . . of Berkeleianism. And I cannot imagine a more "terrible vengeance" on Bogdanov than to have his <I>Empirio-Monism</I> translated, say, into German and presented for review to Leclair and Schubert-Soldern, Cornelius and Kleinpeter, Carus and Pillon (the French collaborator and disciple of Renouvier). The compliments that would be paid by these outright comrades-in-arms and, at times, direct followers of Mach to the "substitution" would be much more eloquent than their arguments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   However, it would scarcely be correct to regard Bogdanov's philosophy as a finished and static system. In the nine years from 1899 to 1908, Bogdanov has gone through four stages in his philosophical peregrinations. At the beginning he was a "natural-historical" materialist (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., semi-consciously and instinctively faithful to the spirit of science). His <I>Fundamental Elements of the Historical Outlook on Nature</I> bears obvious traces of that stage. The second stage was the "energetics" of Ostwald, which was so fashionable in the latter 'nineties, a muddled agnosticism which at times stumbled into idealism. From Ostwald (the title page of Ostwald's <I>Lectures on Natural Philosophy</I> bears the inscription: "Dedicated to E. Mach") Bogdanov went over to Mach, that is, he borrowed the fundamental premises of a subjective idealism that is as inconsistent and muddled as Mach's entire philosophy. The fourth stage is an attempt to eliminate some of the contradictions of Machism, and to create a semblance of objective idealism. "The theory of general substitution" shows that Bogdanov has described a curve of almost 180&#176; from his starting position. Is this stage of Bogdanov's 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 275</B></FONT><P>

philosophy more remote or less remote from dialectical materialism than the previous stages? If Bogdanov remains in one place, then he is, of course, more remote. If he keeps moving along the same curve in which he has been moving for the last nine years, he is less remote. He now has <I>only</I> one serious step to make in order to return once more to materialism, namely, universally to discard his whole universal substitution. For this universal substitution gathers into one Chinese pigtail all the transgressions of half-hearted idealism and all the weaknesses of consistent subjective idealism, just as (<I>si licet parva componere magnis </I>! -- if it is permissible to compare the great with the small) Hegel's "Absolute Idea" gathered together all the contradictions of Kantian idealism and all the weaknesses of Fichteanism. Feuerbach had to make only <I>one</I> serious step in order to return to materialism, namely, universally to discard, absolutely to eliminate, the Absolute Idea, that Hegelian "substitution of the psychical" for physical nature. Feuerbach cut off the Chinese pigtail of philosophical idealism, in other words, he took nature as the basis without any "substitution" whatever. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must wait and see whether the Chinese pigtail of Machian idealism will go on growing for much longer.

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  As a supplement to what has been said above of the idealists as the comrades-in-arms and successors of empirio-criticism, it will be appropriate to dwell on the character of the Machian criticism of certain philosophical propositions touched upon in our literature. For instance, our Machian would-be 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 276</B></FONT><P>

Marxists fastened with glee on Plekhanov's "hieroglyphs," that is, on the theory that man's sensations and ideas are not copies of real things and processes of nature, not their images, but conventional signs, symbols, hieroglyphs, and so on. Bazarov ridicules this hieroglyphic materialism; and, it should be stated, <I>he would be right</I> in doing so if he rejected hieroglyphic materialism in favour of non-hieroglyphic <I>materialism</I>. But Bazarov here again resorts to a sleight-of-hand and palms off his renunciation of materialism as a criticism of "hieroglyphism." Engels speaks neither of symbols nor of hieroglyphs, but of copies, photographs, images, mirror-reflections of things. Instead of pointing out the erroneousness of Plekhanov's deviation from Engels' formulation of materialism, Bazarov uses Plekhanov's error in order to conceal Engels' truth from the reader. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To make clear both Plekhanov's error and Bazarov's confusion we shall refer to an important advocate of the "theory of symbols" (calling a symbol a hieroglyph changes nothing), Helmholtz, and shall see how he was criticised by the materialists and by the idealists in conjunction with the Machians. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Helmholtz, a scientist of the first magnitude, was as inconsistent in philosophy as are the great majority of scientists. He tended towards Kantianism, but in his epistemology he did not adhere even to these views consistently. Here for instance are some passages on the subject of the correspondance of ideas and objects from his <I>Handbook of Physiological Optics </I>: "I have . . . designated sensations as merely <I>symbols</I> for the relations of the external world and I have denied that they have any similarity or equivalence to what they represent" (French translation, p. 579; German original, p. 442). This is agnosticism, but on the same page further on we read: "Our concepts and ideas are <I>effects</I> wrought on 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 277</B></FONT><P>

our nervous system and our consciousness by the objects that are perceived and apprehended." This is materialism. But Helmholtz is not clear as to the relation between absolute and relative truth, as is evident from his subsequent remarks. For instance, a little further on he says: "I therefore think that there can be no possible meaning in speaking of the truth of our ideas save as a <I>practical</I> truth. Our ideas of things <I>cannot be anything but</I> symbols, natural signs for things, which we learn to use in order to regulate our movements and actions. When we have learned to read these symbols rightly we are in a position with their aid to direct our actions so as to achieve the desired result. . . ." This is not correct. Helmholtz here lapses into subjectivism, into a denial of objective reality and objective truth. And he arrives at a flagrant untruth when he concludes the paragraph with the words: "An idea and the object it represents obviously belong to two entirely different worlds. . . ." Only the Kantians thus divorce idea from reality, consciousness from nature. However, a little further on we read: "As to the properties of the objects of the external world, a little reflection will show that all the properties we may attribute to them merely signify the <I>effects</I> wrought by them either on our senses or on other natural objects" (French ed., p. 581; German original, p. 445; I translate from the French). Here again Helmholtz reverts to the materialist position. Helmholtz was an inconsistent Kantian, now recognising <I>a priori</I> laws of thought, now tending towards the "transcendental reality" of time and space (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., to a materialist conception of them); now deriving human sensations from external objects, which act upon our sense organs, and now declaring sensations to be only symbols, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., certain arbitrary signs divorced from the "entirely different" world of the things signified (<I>cf&nbsp;. Viktor Heyfelder, <I>Ueber</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 278</B></FONT><P>

<I>den Begriff der Erfahrung bei Helmholtz</I> [<I>Helmholtz's Conception of Experience </I>], Berlin 1897). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is how Helmholtz expressed his views in a speech delivered in 1878 on "Facts in Perception" ("a noteworthy pronouncement from the realistic camp," as Leclair characterised this speech): "Our sensations are indeed effects wrought by external causes in our organs, and the manner in which such effects manifest themselves, of course, depends very essentially on the nature of the apparatus on which these effects are wrought. Inasmuch as the quality of our sensation informs us of the properties of the external action by which this sensation is produced, the latter can be regarded as its <I>sign</I> (<I>Zeichen </I>), but not as its <I>image</I>. For a certain resemblance to the object imaged is demanded of an image. . . . But a sign need not resemble that of which it is a sign. . ." (<I>Vortr&aumlge und Reden</I> [<I>Lectures and Speeches </I>], 1884, Bd. II, S. 226). If sensations are not images of things, but only signs or symbols which do "not resemble" them, then Helmholtz's initial materialist premise is undermined; the existence of external objects becomes subject to doubt; for signs or symbols may quite possibly indicate imaginary objects, and everybody is familiar with instances of <I>such</I> signs or symbols. Helmholtz, following Kant, attempts to draw something like an absolute boundary between the "phenomenon" and the "thing-in itself." Helmholtz harbours an insuperable prejudice against straightforward, clear, and open materialism. But a little further on he says: "I do not see how one could refute a system even of the most extreme subjective idealism that chose to regard life as a dream. One might declare it to be highly improbable and unsatisfactory -- I myself would in this case subscribe to the severest expressions of dissent -- yet it could be constructed consistently. . . . The realistic hypo-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 279</B></FONT><P>

thesis, on the contrary, trusts the evidence (<I>Aussage </I>) of ordinary self-observation, according to which the changes of perception that follow a certain action have no psychical connection with the preceding impulse of volition. This hypothesis regards everything that seems to be substantiated by our everyday perception, <I>viz</I>., the material world outside of us, as existing independently of our ideas." (pp. 242-43.) "Undoubtedly, the realistic hypothesis is the simplest we can construct; it has been tested and verified in an extremely broad field of application; it is sharply defined in its several parts and, therefore, it is in the highest degree useful and fruitful as a basis of action" (p. 243). Helmholtz's agnosticism also resembles "shamefaced materialism," with certain Kantian twists, in distinction to Huxley's Berkeleian twists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Albrecht Rau, a follower of Feuerbach, therefore vigorously criticises Helmholtz's theory of symbols as an inconsistent deviation from "realism." Helmholtz's basic view, says Rau, is a realistic hypothesis, according to which "we apprehend the objective properties of things with the help of our senses."* The theory of symbols cannot be reconciled with such a view (which, as we have seen, is wholly materialist), for it implies a certain distrust of perception, a distrust of the evidence of our sense-organs. It is beyond doubt that an image cannot wholly resemble the model, but an image is one thing, a symbol, a <I>conventional sign</I>, another. The image inevitably and of necessity implies the objective reality of that which it "images." "Conventional sign," symbol, hieroglyph are concepts which introduce an entirely unnecessary element of agnosticism. Albrecht Rau, therefore,

</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 280</B></FONT><P>

is perfectly right in saying that Helmholtz's theory of symbols pays tribute to Kantianism. "Had Helmholtz," says Rau, "remained true to his realistic conception, had he consistently adhered to the basic principle that the properties of bodies express the relations of bodies to each other and also to us, he obviously would have had no need of the whole theory of symbols; he could then have said, briefly and clearly: the sensations which are produced in us by things are reflections of the nature of those things" (<I>ibid</I>., p. 320). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is the way a materialist criticises Helmholtz. He rejects Helmholtz's hieroglyphic or symbolic materialism or semi-materialism in favour of Feuerbach's consistent materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The idealist Leclair (a representative of the "immanentist school," so dear to Mach's heart and mind) also accuses Helmholtz of inconsistency, of wavering between materialism and spiritualism. (<I>Der Realismus</I>, <I>etc</I>., S. 154.) But for Leclair the theory of symbols is not insufficiently materialistic but too materialistic. Leclair says: "Helmholtz thinks that the perceptions of our consciousness offer sufficient support for the cognition of sequence in time as well as of the identity or non-identity of transcendental causes. This in Helmholtz's opinion is sufficient for the assumption and cognition of law in the realm of the transcendental" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., in the realm of the objectively real) (p. 33). And Leclair thunders against this "dogmatic prejudice of Helmholtz's": "Berkeley's God," he exclaims, "as the hypothetical cause of <I>the conformity to natural law</I> of the ideas in our mind is at least just as capable of satisfying our need of causality as a world of external objects" (p. 31). "A consistent application of the theory of symbols. . . can achieve nothing without a generous admixture of vulgar realism" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialism) (p. 35). 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 281</B></FONT><P>

  This is how a "critical idealist" criticised Helmholtz for his materialism in 1879. Twenty years later, in his article "The Fundamental Views of Ernst Mach and Heinrich Hertz on Physics,"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp281">*</A>]</FONT> Kleinpeter, the disciple of Mach so highly praised by his teacher, refuted in the following way the "antiquated" Helmholtz with the aid of Mach's "recent" philosophy. Let us for the moment leave aside Hertz (who, in fact, was as inconsistent as Helmholtz) and examine Kleinpeter's comparison of Mach and Helmholtz. Having quoted a number of passages from the works of both writers, and having particularly stressed Mach's well-known statements to the effect that bodies are mental symbols for complexes of sensations and so on, Kleinpeter says: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "If we follow Helmholtz's line of thought, we shall encounter the following fundamental premises: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "1)&nbsp;There exist objects of the external world. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "2)&nbsp;A change in these objects is inconceivable without the action of some cause (which is thought of as real). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "3)&nbsp;'Cause, according to the original meaning of the word, is the unchangeable residue or being behind the changing phenomena, namely, substance and the law of its action, force.' [The quotation is taken by Kleinpeter from Helmholtz.] 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "4)&nbsp;It is possible to deduce all phenomena from their causes in a logically strict and uniquely determined manner. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "5)&nbsp;The achievement of this end is equivalent to the possession of objective truth, the acquisition (<I>Erlangung </I>) of which is thus regarded as conceivable" (p. 163). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Rendered indignant by these premises, by their contradictoriness and their creation of insoluble problems, Klein-

peter remarks that Helmholtz does not hold strictly to these views and sometimes employs "turns of speech which are somewhat suggestive of Mach's purely logical understanding of such words" as matter, force, causality, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It is not difficult to find the source of our dissatisfaction with Helmholtz, if we recall Mach's fine, clear words. The false understanding of the words mass, force, etc., is the basic weakness of Helmholtz's whole argument. These are only concepts, products of our imagination and not realities existing outside of thought. We are not even in a position to know such things. From the observation of our senses we are in general unable, owing to their imperfection, to make even a single uniquely determined conclusion. We can never assert, for instance, that upon reading a certain scale (<I>durch Ablesen einer Skala </I>) we shall obtain a definite figure: there are always, within certain limits, an infinite number of possible figures all equally compatible with the facts of the observation. And to have knowledge of something real lying outside us -- that is for us impossible. Let us assume, however, that it were possible, and that we did get to know reality; in that case we would have no right to apply the laws of logic to it, for they are <I>our</I> laws, applicable only to our conceptions, to <I>our</I> mental products [Kleinpeter's italics]. Between facts there is no logical connection, but only a simple succession; apodictic assertions are here unthinkable. It is therefore incorrect to say that one fact is the cause of another and, consequently, the whole deduction built up by Helmholtz on this conception falls to the ground. Finally, the attainment of objective truth, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., truth existing independently of any subject, is impossible, not only because of the nature of our senses, but also because as men (<I>als Menschen </I>) we can 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 283</B></FONT><P>

in general have no notion of what exists quite independently of us (p. 164). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As the reader sees, our disciple of Mach, repeating the favourite phrases of his teacher and of Bogdanov, who does not own himself a Machian, rejects Helmholtz's whole philosophy, rejects it from the idealist standpoint. The theory of symbols is not even especially singled out by the idealist, who regards it as an unimportant and perhaps accidental deviation from materialism. And Helmholtz is chosen by Kleinpeter as a representative of the "traditional views in physics," "views shared to this day by the majority of phys icists (p. 160). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The result we have arrived at is that Plekhanov was guilty of an obvious mistake in his exposition of materialism, but that Bazarov completely muddled the matter, mixed up materialism with idealism and advanced in opposition to the "theory of symbols," or "hieroglyphic materialism," the idealist nonsense that "sense-perception is the reality existing out side us." From the Kantian Helmholtz, just as from Kant himself, the materialists went to the Left, the Machians to the Right.

                              7.&nbsp;TWO KINDS OF CRITICISM OF D&#220;HRING
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Let us note another characteristic feature in the Machians' incredible perversion of materialism. Valentinov endeavours to beat the Marxists by comparing them to B&uumlchner, who supposedly has much in common with Plekhanov, although Engels sharply dissociated himself from Buchner. Bogdanov, approaching the same question from another angle, defends, as it were, the "materialism of the natural scientists," which, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 284</B></FONT><P>

he says, "is usually spoken of with a certain contempt" (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, p. x). Both Valentinov and Bogdanov are wretchedly muddled on this question. Marx and Engels always "spoke contemptuously" of bad socialists; but from this it follows that they demanded the teaching of correct socialism, scientific socialism, and not a flight from socialism to bourgeois views. Marx and Engels always condemned <I>bad</I> (and, particularly, anti-dialectical) materialism; but they condemned it from the standpoint of a higher, more advanced dialectical <I>materialism</I>, and not from the standpoint of Humism or Berkeleianism. Marx, Engels and Dietzgen would discuss the bad materialists, reason with them and seek to correct their errors. But they would not even discuss the Humeans and Berkeleians, Mach and Avenarius, confining themselves to a single still more contemptuous remark about their trend <I>as a whole</I>. Therefore, the endless faces and grimaces made by our Machians over Holbach and Co., B&uumlchner and Co., etc., are absolutely nothing but an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public, a cover for the departure of Machism as a whole from the very foundations of materialism in general, and a fear to take up a straightforward and clear position with regard to Engels. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And it would be hard to express oneself more clearly on the French materialism of the eighteenth century and on B&uumlchner, Vogt and Moleschott, than Engels does at the end of Chapter II of his <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>. It is impossible not to understand Engels, unless one deliberately wishes to distort him. Marx and I are materialists -- says Engels in this chapter, explaining what <I>fundamentally</I> distinguishes all schools of materialism from <I>the whole camp</I> of the idealists, from all the Kantians and Humeans in general. And Engels <I>reproaches Feuerbach for a certain pusillanimity</I>, a certain 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 285</B></FONT><P>

frivolity of thought, as expressed in his rejection at times of materialism in general because of the mistakes of one or another school of materialists. Feuerbach "should not have confounded the doctrines of these hedge-preachers<A NAME="p285"> [B&uumlchner and Co.] with materialism in general," says Engels (p. 21).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en102">102</A>]</FONT> Only minds that are spoilt by reading and credulously accepting the doctrines of the German reactionary professors could have <I>misunderstood</I> the nature of such reproaches levelled by Engels at Feuerbach. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Engels says very clearly that B&uumlchner and Co. "by no means overcame the limitations of their teachers," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the materialists of the eighteenth century, that they had not made a single <I>step forward</I>. And it is for this, and <I>this alone</I>, that Engels took B&uumlchner and Co. to task; not for their materialism, as the ignoramuses think, but because they did not <I>advance</I> materialism, because "<I>it was quite outside their scope to develop the theory</I> [of materialism] <I>any further</I>." It was for this alone that Engels took B&uumlchner and Co. to task. And thereupon point by point Engels enumerates three fundamental "limitations" (<I>Beschr&aumlnktheit </I>) of the French materialists of the eighteenth century, from which Marx and Engels had emancipated themselves, but from which B&uumlchner and Co. were unable to emancipate themselves. The first limitation was that the views of the old materialists were "mechanical," <I>in the sense</I> that they believed in "the exclusive application of the standards of mechanics to processes of a chemical and organic nature" (p. 19). We shall see in the next chapter that failure to understand these words of Engels' caused certain people to succumb to idealism through the new physics. Engels does not reject <I>mechanical</I> materialism for the faults attributed to it by physicists of the "recent" idealist (alias Machian) trend. The second limitation was the meta-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 286</B></FONT><P>

physical character of the views of the old materialists, meaning the "<I>anti-dialectical character of their philosophy</I>." This limitation is fully shared with B&uumlchner and Co. by our Machians, who, as we have seen, entirely failed to understand Engels' application of dialectics to epistemology (for example, absolute and relative truth). The third limitation was the preservation of idealism "up above," in the realm of the social sciences, a non-understanding of historical materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Having enumerated these three "limitations" and explained them with exhaustive clarity (pp. 19-21), Engels <I>then and there</I> adds that they (B&uumlchner and Co.) did not emerge "<I>from these limits </I>" (<I>&uumlber diese Schranken </I>). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Exclusively</I> for these three things and exclusively within these limits, does Engels refute both the materialism of the eighteenth century and the doctrines of B&uumlchner and Co.! On all other, more elementary, questions of materialism (questions distorted by the Machians) <I>there is and can be no difference</I> between Marx and Engels on the one hand and all these old materialists on the other. It was only the Russian Machians who brought confusion into this perfectly clear question, since for their West-European teachers and co-thinkers the radical difference between the line of Mach and his friends and the line of the materialists generally is perfectly obvious. Our Machians found it necessary to confuse the issue in order to represent their break with Marxism and their desertion to the camp of bourgeois philosophy as "minor corrections" of Marxism! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take D&uumlhring. It is hard to imagine anything more contemptuous than the opinion of him expressed by Engels. But <I>at the same time that D&uumlhring was criticised by Engels</I>, just see <I>how he was criticised by Leclair</I>, who praises Mach's "revolutionising philosophy." Leclair regards D&uumlhring as the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 287</B></FONT><P>

"<I>extreme Left </I>" of materialism, which "without any evasion declares sensation, as well as every activity of consciousness and intelligence in general, to be the secretion, function, supreme flower, aggregate effect, etc., of the animal organism" (<I>Der Realismus</I>, <I>etc</I>., 1879, S. 23-24). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is it for this that Engels criticised D&uumlhring? No. In this he was in <I>full agreement</I> with D&uumlhring, as he was with every other materialist. He criticised D&uumlhring from the diametrically opposite standpoint, namely, for the inconsistency of his materialism, for his idealist fancies, which left a loophole for fideism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Nature itself works both within ideating beings and from without, in order to create the required knowledge of the course of things by systematically producing coherent views." Leclair quotes these words of D&uumlhring's and savagely attacks the materialism of such a point of view, the "crude metaphysics" of this materialism, the "self-deception," etc., etc. (pp. 160 and 161-63). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is it for this that Engels criticised D&uumlhring? No. He ridiculed all florid language, but as regards the cognition of objective law in nature, reflected by the consciousness, <I>Engels was fully in agreement with D&uumlhring</I>, as he was with every other materialist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Thought is a form of reality higher than the rest. . . . A fundamental premise is the independence and distinction of the materially real world from the groups of manifestations of the consciousness." Leclair quotes these words of D&uumlhring's together with a number of D&uumlhring's attacks on Kant, etc., and for this accuses D&uumlhring of "metaphysics" (pp. 218-22), of subscribing to "a metaphysical dogma," etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is it for this that Engels criticised D&uumlhring? No. That the world exists independently of the mind and that every 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 288</B></FONT><P>

deviation from this truth on the part of the Kantians, Humeans, Berkeleians, and so forth, is false, on this point Engels was fully in agreement with D&uumlhring, as he was with every other materialist. Had Engels seen <I>from what angle</I> Leclair, in the spirit of Mach, criticised D&uumlhring, he would have called both these philosophical reactionaries names <I>a hundred times</I> more contemptuous than those he called D&uumlhring. To Leclair D&uumlhring was the incarnation of pernicious realism and materialism (<I>cf</I>. also <I>Beitr&aumlge zu einer monistischen Erkenntnistheorie</I>, 1882, S. 45). In 1878, W. Schuppe, teacher and comrade-in-arms of Mach, accused D&uumlhring of "visionary realism" (<I>Traumrealismus </I>)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp288">*</A>]</FONT> in revenge for the epithet "visionary idealism" which D&uumlhring had hurled against all idealists. For Engels, <I>on the contrary</I>, D&uumlhring was <I>not a sufficiently</I> steadfast, clear and consistent materialist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Marx and Engels, as well as J. Dietzgen, entered the philosophical arena at a time when materialism reigned among the advanced intellectuals in general, and in working-class circles in particular. It is therefore quite natural that they should have devoted their attention not to a repetition of old ideas but to a serious theoretical <I>development</I> of materialism, its application to history, in other words, to the <I>completion</I> of the edifice of materialist philosophy <I>up to its summit</I>. It is quite natural that in the sphere of epistemology they <I>confined</I> themselves to correcting Feuerbach's errors, to ridiculing the banalities of the materialist D&uumlhring, to criticising the errors of B&uumlchner (see J. Dietzgen), to emphasising what these most widely known and popular writers among the workers <I>particularly</I> lacked, namely, dialectics. Marx, Engels and J. Dietz-

gen did not worry about the elementary truths of materialism, which had been cried by the hucksters in dozens of books, but devoted all their attention to ensuring that these elementary truths should not be vulgarised, should not be over-simplified, should not lead to stagnation of thought ("materialism below, idealism above"), to forgetfulness of the <I>valuable</I> fruit of the idealist systems, Hegelian dialectics -- that pearl which those farmyard cocks, the B&uumlchners, the D&uumlhrings and Co. (as well as Leclair, Mach, Avenarius and so forth), could not pick out from the dungheap of absolute idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If one envisages at all concretely the historical conditions in which the philosophical works of Engels and J. Dietzgen were written, it will be perfectly clear why they were <I>more concerned to dissociate</I> themselves from the vulgarisation of the elementary truths of materialism than to <I>defend</I> the truths themselves. Marx and Engels were similarly more concerned to dissociate themselves from the vulgarisation of the fundamental demands of political democracy than to defend these demands. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Only disciples of the philosophical reactionaries could have "failed to notice" this circumstance, and could have presented the case to their readers in such a way as to make it appear that Marx and Engels did not know what being a materialist means.

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The previously cited example of Helfond already contains the answer to this question, and we shall not examine the innumerable instances in which J. Dietzgen receives Helfond-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 290</B></FONT><P>

like treatment at the hands of our Machians. It is more expedient to quote a number of passages from J. Dietzgen himself in order to bring out his weak points. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Thought is a function of the brain," says Dietzgen (<I>Das Wesen der menschlichen Kopfarbeit</I>, 1903, S. 52; there is a Russian translation). "Thought is a product of the brain. . . . My desk, as the content of my thought, is identical with that thought, does not differ from it. But my desk outside of my head is a separate object quite distinct from it" (p. 53). These perfectly clear materialistic propositions are, however, supplemented by Dietzgen thus: "Nevertheless, the non-sensible idea is also sensible, material, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., real. . . . The mind differs no more from the table, light, or sound than these things differ from each other" (p. 54). This is obviously false. That both thought and matter are "real," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., exist, is true. But to say that thought is material is to make a false step, a step towards confusing materialism and idealism. As a matter of fact this is only an inexact expression of Dietzgen's, who elsewhere correctly says: "Mind and matter at least have this in common, that they exist" (p. 80). "Thinking," says Dietzgen, "is a work of the body. . . . In order to think I require a substance that can be thought of. This substance is provided in the phenomena of nature and life. . . . Matter is the boundary of the mind, beyond which the latter cannot pass. . . . Mind is a product of matter, but matter is more than a product of mind. . ." (p. 64). The Machians refrain from analysing materialist arguments of the materialist Dietzgen such as these! They prefer to fasten on passages where he is inexact and muddled. For example, he says that scientists can be "idealists only outside their field" (p. 108). Whether this is so, and why it is so, on this the Machians are silent. But a page or so earlier Dietzgen recognises the "positive side 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 291</B></FONT><P>

of modern idealism" (p. 106) and the "inadequacy of the materialist principle," which should rejoice the Machians. The incorrectly expressed thought of Dietzgen's consists in the fact that the difference between matter and mind is also <I>relative and not excessive</I> (p. 107). This is true, but what follows from this is not that materialism as such is inadequate, but that metaphysical, anti-dialectical materialism is inadequate. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Simple, scientific truth is not based on a person. It has its foundation outside [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of the person], in its material; it is objective truth. . . . We call ourselves materialists. . . . Philosophical materialists are distinguished by the fact that they put the corporeal world at the beginning, at the head, and put the idea, or spirit, as the sequel, whereas their opponents, after the manner of religion, derive things from the word. . . the material world from the idea" (<I>Kleinere philosophische Schriften</I>, 1903, S. 59, 62). The Machians avoid this recognition of objective truth and repetition of <I>Engels'</I> definition of materialism. But Dietzgen goes on to say: "We would be equally right in calling ourselves idealists, for our system is based on the total result of philosophy, on the scientific investigation of the idea, on a clear insight into the nature of mind" (p. 63). It is not difficult to seize upon this obviously incorrect phrase in order to deny materialism. Actually, Dietzgen's formulation is more inexact than his basic thought, which amounts to this, that the old materialism was unable to investigate ideas scientifically (with the aid of historical materialism). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here are Dietzgen's ideas on the old materialism. "Like our understanding of political economy, our materialism is a scientific, historical conquest. Just as definitely as we distinguish ourselves from the socialists of the past, so we distinguish ourselves from the old materialists. With the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 292</B></FONT><P>

latter we have only this in common, that we acknowledge matter to be the premise, or prime base of the idea" (p. 140). This word "only" is significant! It contains the <I>whole</I> epistemological foundation of materialism, <I>as distinguished from</I> agnosticism, Machism, idealism. But Dietzgen's attention is here concentrated on dissociating himself from vulgar materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
  But then follows a little further on a passage that is quite incorrect: "The concept matter must be broadened. It embraces all the phenomena of reality, as well as our faculty of knowing or explaining" (p. 141). This is a muddle which can only lead to confusing materialism and idealism under the guise of "broadening" the former. To seize upon this "broadening" would be to forget the <I>basis</I> of Dietzgen's philosophy, the recognition of matter as the primary, "the boundary of the mind." But, as a matter of fact, a few lines further down Dietzgen corrects himself: "The whole governs the part, matter the mind. . . . In this sense we may love and honour the material world . . . as the first cause, as the creator of heaven and earth" (p. 142). That the conception of "matter" must also include thoughts,<A NAME="p292"> as Dietzgen repeats in the <I>Excursions</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en103">103</A>]</FONT> (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 214), is a muddle, for if such an inclusion is made, the epistemological contrast between mind and matter, idealism and materialism, a contrast upon which Dietzgen himself insists, loses all meaning. That this contrast must not be made "excessive," exaggerated, metaphysical, is beyond dispute (and it is to the great credit of the <I>dialectical</I> materialist Dietzgen that he emphasised this). The limits of the absolute necessity and absolute truth of this relative contrast are precisely those limits which define the <I>trend</I> of epistemological investigations. To operate beyond these limits with the distinction between matter and mind, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 293</B></FONT><P>

physical and mental, as though they were absolute opposites, would be a great mistake. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Dietzgen, unlike Engels, expresses his thoughts in a vague, unclear, mushy way. But apart from his defects of exposition and his individual mistakes, he not unsuccessfully champions the "<I>materialist theory of knowledge </I>" (pp. 222 and 271), "<I>dialectical materialism </I>" (p. 224). "The materialist theory of knowledge then," says Dietzgen, "amounts to the recognition that the human organ of perception radiates no metaphysical light, but is a piece of nature which reflects other pieces of nature" (pp. 222-23). "Our perceptive faculty is not a supernatural source of truth, but a mirror-like instrument, which reflects the things of the world, or nature" (p. 243). Our profound Machians avoid an analysis of each individual proposition of Dietzgen's <I>materialist theory of knowledge</I>, but seize upon his <I>deviations</I> from that theory, upon his vagueness and confusion. J. Dietzgen could find favour with the reactionary philosophers only because he occasionally gets muddled. And, it goes without saying, where there is a muddle there you will find Machians. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marx wrote to Kugelmann on December 5, 1868: "A fairly long time ago he [Dietzgen] sent me a fragment of a manuscript on the 'faculty of thought' which in spite of a certain confusion and of too frequent repetition, contains much that is excellent<A NAME="p293"> and -- as the independent product of a working man -- admirable" (Russ. trans., p. 53).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en104">104</A>]</FONT> Mr. Valentinov quotes this opinion, but <I>it never dawned on him to ask what</I> Marx regarded as Dietzgen's <I>confusion</I>, whether it was that which brings Dietzgen close to Mach, or that which distinguishes Dietzgen from Mach. Mr. Valentinov does not ask this question because he read both Dietzgen and Marx's letters after the manner of Gogol's Petrushka. Yet it is not 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 294</B></FONT><P>

difficult to find the answer to this question. Marx frequently called his world outlook dialectical materialism, and Engels' <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, <I>the whole of which Marx read through in manuscript</I>, expounds precisely this world outlook. Hence, it should have been clear even to the Valentinovs that Dietzgen's <I>confusion</I> could lie only in <I>his deviation</I> from a consistent application of dialectics, from consistent <I>materialism</I>, in particular from <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Does it now dawn upon Mr. Valentinov and his brethren that what Marx could call Dietzgen's confusion is <I>only what brings Dietzgen close to Mach</I>, who went from Kant not towards materialism, but towards Berkeley and Hume? Or was it that the materialist Marx called Dietzgen's materialist theory of knowledge confused, yet approved his deviations from materialism, that is, approved what differs from <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, which was written with his (Marx's) participation? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Whom are they trying to fool, our Machians, who desire to be regarded as Marxists and at the same time inform the world that "<I>their </I>" Mach approved of Dietzgen? Have our heroes failed to guess that Mach could approve in Dietzgen only that which Marx called confusion? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But taken as a whole, J. Dietzgen does not deserve so severe a censure. He is nine-tenths a materialist and never made any claims either to originality or to possessing a special philosophy distinct from materialism. He spoke of Marx frequently, and invariably as the <I>head of the trend</I> (<I>Kleinere philosophische Schriften</I>, S. 4 -- an opinion uttered in 1873; on page 95 -- 1876 -- he emphasises that Marx and Engels "possessed the necessary philosophical training"; on page 181 -- 1886 -- he speaks of Marx and Engels as the "acknowledged founders" of the trend).<A NAME="p294"> Dietzgen was a Marxist, and Eugene Dietzgen,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en105">105</A>]</FONT> and -- alasl -- Comrade P. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 295</B></FONT><P>

Dauge are rendering him left-handed service by their invention of "Naturmonismus," "Dietzgenism," etc. "Dietzgenism" as distinct from dialectical materialism is <I>confusion</I>, a <I>step</I> towards reactionary philosophy, an attempt to create a trend not from what is great in Joseph Dietzgen (and in that worker-philosopher, who discovered dialectical materialism in his own way, there is much that is great!) but <I>from his weak points</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I shall confine myself to two examples in order to illustrate how Comrade P. Dauge and Eugene Dietzgen are sliding into reactionary philosophy. 
<A NAME="p295">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the second edition of the <I>Akquisit</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en106">106</A>]</FONT> (p. 273), Dauge writes: "Even bourgeois criticism points out the connection between Dietzgen's philosophy and empirio-criticism and also the immanentist school," and, further on, "especially Leclair" (a quotation from a "bourgeois criticism"). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That P. Dauge values and esteems J. Dietzgen cannot be doubted. But it also cannot be doubted that he is <I>defaming</I> him by citing <I>without protest</I> the opinion of a bourgeois scribbler who classes the sworn enemy of fideism and of the professors -- the "graduated flunkeys" of the bourgeoisie --  with the outspoken preacher of fideism and avowed reactionary, Leclair. It is possible that Dauge repeated another's opinion of the immanentists and of Leclair without himself being familiar with the writings of these reactionaries. But let this serve him as a warning: the road <I>away from</I> Marx to the peculiarities of Dietzgen -- to Mach -- to the immanentists -- is a road leading into a morass. To class him not only with Leclair but even with Mach is to lay stress on Dietzgen the muddlehead as distinct from Dietzgen the materialist. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 296</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  I shall defend Dietzgen against Dauge. I assert that Dietzgen did not deserve the shame of being classed with Leclair. And I can cite a witness, a most authoritative one on such a question, one who is as much a reactionary, as much a fideist and "immanentist" philosopher as Leclair himself, namely, Schubert-Soldern. In 1896 he wrote: "The Social-Democrats willingly lean for support on Hegel with more or less (usually less) justification, but they materialise the Hegelian philosophy; <I>cf</I>. J. Dietzgen. . . . With Dietzgen, the absolute becomes the universal, and this becomes the thing-in-itself, the absolute subject, whose appearances are its predicates. That he [Dietzgen] is thus converting a pure abstraction into the basis of the concrete process, he does not, of course, realise any more than Hegel himself did. . . . He frequently chaotically lumps together Hegel, Darwin, Haeckel, and natural-scientific materialism" (<I>Die soziale Frage</I>, S. xxxiii). Schubert-Soldern is a keener judge of philosophical shades than Mach, who praises everybody indiscriminately, including the Kantian Jerusalem. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Eugene Dietzgen was so simple-minded as to complain to the German public that in Russia the narrow materialists had "insulted" Joseph Dietzgen, and he translated Plekhanov's and Dauge's articles on Joseph Dietzgen into German. (See Joseph Dietzgen, <I>Erkenntnis und Wahrheit</I> [<I>Knowledge and Truth </I>], Stuttgart, 1908, Appendix). The poor "Natur-monist's" complaint rebounded on his own head. Franz Mehring, who may be regarded as knowing something of philosophy and Marxism, wrote in his review that Plekhanov was essentially right as against Dauge (<I>Die Neue Zeit</I>, 1908, No. 38, 19. Juni, Feuilleton, S. 432). That J. Dietzgen <I>got into difficulties</I> when he <I>deviated</I> from Marx and Engels (p. 431) is for Mehring beyond question. Eugene Dietzgen replied to 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 297</B></FONT><P>

Mehring in a long, snivelling note, in which he went so far as to say that J. Dietzgen might be of service "in reconciling" the "warring brothers, the orthodox and the revisionists" (<I>Die Neue Zeit</I>, 1908, No. 44, 31. Juli, S. 652). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Another warning, Comrade Dauge: the road away from Marx to "Dietzgenism" and "Machism" is a <I>road into the morass</I>, not for individuals, not for Tom, Dick and Harry, but for the trend. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And do not complain, Messrs. Machians, that I quote the "authorities"; your objections to the authorities are but a screen for the fact that for the socialist authorities (Marx, Engels, Lafargue, Mehring, Kautsky) you are substituting bourgeois <I>authorities</I> (Mach, Petzoldt, Avenarius and the immanentists). You would do better not to raise the question of "authorities" and "authoritarianism"!

                               SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEALISM
</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A year ago, in <I>Die Neue Zeit</I> (1906-07, No. 52), there appeared an article by Joseph Diner-D&eacutenes entitled "Marxism and the Recent Revolution in the Natural Sciences." The defect of this article is that it ignores the epistemological conclusions which are being drawn from the "new" physics and in which we are especially interested at present. But it is precisely this defect which renders the point of view and the conclusions of the author particularly interesting for us. Joseph Diner-D&eacutenes, like the present writer, holds the view of the "rank-and-file Marxist," of whom our Machians speak with such haughty contempt. For instance, Mr. Yushkevich writes that "ordinarily, the average rank-and-file Marxist calls himself a dialectical materialist" (p. 1 of his book). And now this rank-and-file Marxist, in the person of J. Diner-D&eacutenes, has <I>directly</I> compared the recent discoveries in science, and especially in physics (X-rays, Becquerel rays, radium, etc.), with Engels' <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>. To what conclusion has this com-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 299</B></FONT><P>

parison led him? "In the most varied fields of natural science," writes Diner-D&eacutenes, "new knowledge has been acquired, all of which tends towards that single point which Engels desired to make clear, namely, that in nature 'there are no irreconcilable contradictions, no forcibly fixed boundary lines and distinctions,' and that if contradictions and distinctions are met with in nature, it is because we alone have introduced their rigidity and absoluteness into nature." It was discovered, for instance, that light and electricity are only manifestations of one and the same force of nature. Each day it becomes more probable that chemical affinity may be reduced to electrical processes. The indestructible and non-disintegrable elements of chemistry, whose number continues to grow as though in derision of the unity of the world, now prove to be destructible and disintegrable. The element radium has been converted into the element helium. "Just as all the forces of nature have been reduced to one force, so all substances in nature have been reduced to <I>one substance </I>" (Diner-D&eacutenes' italics). Quoting the opinion of one of the writers who regard the atom as only a condensation of the ether, the author exclaims: "How brilliantly does this confirm the statement made by Engels thirty years ago that motion is the mode of existence of matter." "All phenomena of nature are motion, and the differences between them lie only in the fact that we human beings perceive this motion in different forms. . . . It is as Engels said. Nature, like history, is subject to the dialectical law of motion." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   On the other hand, you cannot take up any of the writings of the Machians or about Machism without encountering pretentious references to the new physics, which is said to have refuted materialism, and so on and so forth. Whether these assertions are well-founded is another question, but the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 300</B></FONT><P>

connection between the new physics, or rather a definite school of the new physics, and Machism and other varieties of modern idealist philosophy is beyond doubt. To analyse Machism and at the same time to ignore this connection -- as Plekhanov does -- is to scoff at the spirit of dialectical materialism, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., to sacrifice the method of Engels to the letter of Engels. Engels says explicitly that "with each epoch making discovery even in the sphere of natural science ["not to speak of the history of mankind"],<A NAME="p300"> materialism has to change its form" (<I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>, Germ. ed., p. 19).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en107">107</A>]</FONT> Hence, a revision of the "form" of Engels' materialism, a revision of his natural-philosophical propositions is not only not "revisionism," in the accepted meaning of the term, but, on the contrary, is demanded by Marxism. We criticise the Machians not for making such a revision, but for their <I>purely revisionist</I> trick of betraying the <I>essence</I> of materialism under the guise of criticising its <I>form</I> and of adopting the fundamental precepts of reactionary bourgeois philosophy without making the slightest attempt to deal directly, frankly and definitely with assertions of Engels' which are unquestionably extremely important to the given question, as, for example, his assertion that<A NAME="p300a"> ". . . motion without matter is unthinkable" (<I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, p. 50).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en108">108</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It goes without saying that in examining the connection between one of the schools of modern physicists and the rebirth of philosophical idealism, it is far from being our intention to deal with specific physical theories. What interests us exclusively is the epistemological conclusions that follow from certain definite propositions and generally known discoveries. These epistemological conclusions are of themselves so insistent that many physicists are already reaching for them. What is more, there are already various trends among 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 301</B></FONT><P>

the physicists, and definite schools are beginning to be formed on this basis. Our object, therefore, will be confined to explaining clearly the essence of the difference between these various trends and the relation in which they stand to the fundamental lines of philosophy.

                                 1.&nbsp;THE CRISIS IN MODERN PHYSICS
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In his book <I>Valeur de la science</I> [<I>Value of Science </I>], the famous French physicist Henri Poincar&eacute says that there are "symptoms of a serious crisis" in physics, and he devotes a special chapter to this crisis (Chap. VIII, <I>cf</I>. p. 171). The crisis is not confined to the fact that "radium, the great revolutionary," is undermining the principle of the conservation of energy. "All the other principles are equally endangered" (p. 180). For instance, Lavoisier's principle, or the principle of the conservation of mass, has been undermined by the electron theory of matter. According to this theory atoms are composed of very minute particles called electrons, which are charged with positive or negative electricity and "are immersed in a medium which we call the ether." The experiments of physicists provide data for calculating the velocity of the electrons and their mass (or the relation of their mass to their electrical charge). The velocity proves to be comparable with the velocity of light (300,000 kilometres per second), attaining, for instance, one-third of the latter. Under such circumstances the twofold mass of the electron has to be taken into account, corresponding to the necessity of over coming the inertia, firstly, of the electron itself and, secondly, of the ether. The former mass will be the real or mechanical mass of the electron, the latter the "electrodynamic mass which 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 302</B></FONT><P>

represents the inertia of the ether." And it turns out that the former mass is equal to zero. The entire mass of the electrons, or, at least, of the negative electrons, proves to be totally and exclusively electrodynamic in its origin. Mass disappears. The foundations of mechanics are undermined. Newton's principle, the equality of action and reaction, is undermined, and so on. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are faced, says Poincar&eacute, with the "ruins" of the old principles of physics, "a general debacle of principles." It is true, he remarks, that all the mentioned departures from principles refer to infinitesimal magnitudes; it is possible that we are still ignorant of other infinitesimals counteracting the undermining of the old principles. Moreover, radium is very rare. But at any rate we have reached a "<I>period of doubt</I>." We have already seen what epistemological deductions the author draws from this "period of doubt": "it is not nature which imposes on [or dictates to] us the concepts of space and time, but we who impose them on nature"; "whatever is not thought, is pure nothing." These deductions are idealist deductions. The breakdown of the most fundamental principles shows (such is Poincar&eacute's trend of thought) that these principles are not copies, photographs of nature, not images of something external in relation to man's consciousness, but products of his consciousness. Poincar&eacute does not develop these deductions consistently, nor is he essentially interested in the philosophical aspect of the question. It is dealt with in detail by the French writer on philosophical problems, Abel Rey, in his book <I>The Physical Theory of the Modern Physicists</I> (<I>La Th&eacuteorie physique chez les physiciens contemporains</I>, Paris, F. Alcan, 1907). True, the author himself is a positivist, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., a muddlehead and a semi-Machian, but in this case this is even a certain advantage, for he can 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 303</B></FONT><P>

not be suspected of a desire to "slander" our Machians' idol. Rey cannot be trusted when it comes to giving an exact philosophical definition of concepts and of materialism in partic ular, for Rey too is a professor, and as such is imbued with an utter contempt for the materialists (and distinguishes himself by utter ignorance of the epistemology of materialism). It goes without saying that a Marx or an Engels is absolutely non-existent for such "men of science." But Rey summarises carefully and in general conscientiously the extremely abundant literature on the subject, not only French, but English and German as well (Ostwald and Mach in particular), so that we shall have frequent recourse to his work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The attention of philosophers in general, says the author, and also of those who, for one reason or another, wish to criticise science generally, has now been particularly attracted towards physics. "In discussing the limits and value of physical knowledge, it is in effect the legitimacy of positive science, the possibility of knowing the object, that is criticised" (pp. i-ii). From the "crisis in modern physics" people hasten to draw sceptical conclusions (p. 14). Now, what is this crisis? During the first two-thirds of the nineteenth century the physicists agreed among themselves on everything essential. They believed in a purely mechanical explanation of nature: they assumed that physics is nothing but a more complicated mechanics, namely, a molecular mechanics. They differed only as to the methods used in reducing physics to mechanics and as to the details of the mechanism. . . . At present the spectacle presented by the physico-chemical sciences seems completely changed. Extreme disagreement has replaced general unanimity, and no longer does it concern details, but leading and fundamental ideas. While it would be an exaggeration to say that each scientist has his own peculiar tendencies, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 304</B></FONT><P>

it must nevertheless be noted that science, and especially physics, has, like art, its numerous schools, the conclusions of which often differ from, and sometimes are directly opposed and hostile to each other. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "From this one may judge the significance and scope of what has been called the crisis in modern physics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Down to the middle of the nineteenth century, traditional physics had assumed that it was sufficient merely to extend physics in order to arrive at a metaphysics of matter. This physics ascribed to its theories an ontological value. And its theories were all mechanistic. The traditional mechanism [Rey employs this word in the specific sense of a system of ideas which reduces physics to mechanics] thus claimed, over and above the results of experience, a <I>real</I> knowledge of the material universe. This was not a hypothetical account of experience; it was a dogma. . ." (p. 16). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must here interrupt the worthy "positivist." It is clear that he is describing the materialist philosophy of traditional physics but does not want to call the devil (materialism) by name. Materialism to a Humean must appear to be metaphysics, dogma, a transgression of the bounds of experience, and so forth. Knowing nothing of materialism, the Humean Rey has no conception whatever of dialectics, of the difference between dialectical materialism and metaphysical materialism, in Engels' meaning of the term. Hence, the relation between absolute and relative truth, for example, is absolutely unclear to Rey. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . The criticism of traditional mechanism made during the whole of the second half of the nineteenth century weakened the premise of the ontological reality of mechanism. On the basis of these criticisms a philosophical conception of physics was founded which became almost traditional in 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 305</B></FONT><P>

philosophy at the end of the nineteenth century. Science was nothing but a symbolic formula, a method of notation (<I>rep&eacuterage</I>, the creation of signs, marks, symbols), and since the methods of notation varied according to the schools, the conclusion was soon reached that only that was denoted which had been previously designed (<I>fa&ccedilonn&eacute </I>) by man for notation (or symbolisation). Science became a work of art for dilettantes, a work of art for utilitarians: views which could with legitimacy be generally interpreted as the negation of the possibility of science. A science which is a pure artifice for acting upon nature, a mere utilitarian technique, has no right to call itself science, without perverting the meaning of words. To say that science can be nothing but such an artificial means of action is to disavow science in the proper meaning of the term. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The collapse of traditional mechanism, or, more precisely, the criticism to which it was subjected, led to the proposition that science itself had also collapsed. From the impossibility of adhering purely and simply to traditional mechanism it was inferred that science was impossible" (pp. 16-17). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And the author asks: "Is the present crisis in physics a temporary and external incident in the evolution of science, or is science itself making an abrupt right-about-face and definitely abandoning the path it has hitherto pursued?. . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "If the [physical and chemical] sciences, which in history have been essentially emancipators, collapse in this crisis, which reduces them to the status of mere, technically useful recipes but deprives them of all significance from the stand point of knowledge of nature, the result must needs be a complete revolution both in the art of logic and the history of ideas. Physics then loses all educational value; the spirit 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 306</B></FONT><P>

of positive science it represents becomes false and dangerous." Science can offer only practical recipes but no real knowledge. "Knowledge of the real must be sought and given by other means. . . . One must take another road, one must return to subjective intuition, to a mystical sense of reality, in a word, to the mysterious, all that of which one thought it had been deprived" (p. 19). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As a positivist, the author considers such a view wrong and the crisis in physics only temporary. We shall presently see how Rey purifies Mach, Poincar&eacute and Co. of these conclusions. At present we shall confine ourselves to noting the fact of the "crisis" and its significance. From the last words of Rey quoted by us it is quite clear what reactionary elements have taken advantage of and aggravated this crisis. Rey explicitly states in the preface to his work that "the fideist and anti-intellectualist movement of the last years of the nineteenth century" is seeking "to base itself on the general spirit of modern physics" (p. ii). In France, those who put faith above reason are called fideists (from the Latin <I>fides</I>, faith). Anti-intellectualism is a doctrine that denies the rights or claims of reason. Hence, in its philosophical aspect, the essence of the "crisis in modern physics" is that the old physics regarded its theories as "real knowledge of the material world," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., a reflection of objective reality. The new trend in physics regards theories only as symbols, signs, and marks for practice, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., it denies the existence of an objective reality independent of our mind and reflected by it. If Rey had used correct philosophical terminology, he would have said: the materialist theory of knowledge, instinctively accepted by the earlier physics, has been replaced by an idealist and agnostic theory of knowledge, which, against the wishes 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 307</B></FONT><P>

of the idealists and agnostics, has been taken advantage of by fideism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But Rey does not present this replacement, which constitutes the crisis, as though all the modern physicists stand opposed to all the old physicists. No. He shows that in their epistemological trends the modern physicists are divided into three schools: the energeticist or conceptualist school; the mechanistic or neo-mechanistic school, to which the vast majority of physicists still adhere; and in between the two, the critical school. To the first belong Mach and Duhem; to the third, Henri Poincar&eacute; to the second, Kirchhoff, Helmholtz, Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Maxwell -- among the older physicists -- and Larmor and Lorentz among the modern physicists. What the essence of the <I>two</I> basic trends is (for the third is not independent, but intermediate) may be judged from the following words of Rey's: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Traditional mechanism constructed a system of the material world." Its doctrine of the structure of matter was based on "elements qualitatively homogenous and identical"; and elements were to be regarded as "immutable, impenetrable," etc. Physics "constructed a <I>real</I> edifice out of <I>real</I> materials and <I>real</I> cement. The physicist possessed <I>material elements</I>, <I>the causes and modes</I> of their action, and the <I>real</I> laws of their action" (pp. 33-38). "The change in this view consists in the rejection of the ontological significance of the theories and in an exaggerated emphasis on the phenomenological significance of physics." The conceptualist view operates with "pure abstractions . . . and seeks a purely abstract theory which will as far as possible eliminate the hypothesis of matter. . . . The notion of energy thus becomes the substructure of the new physics. This is why conceptualist physics may most often be called <I>energeticist</I> physics," 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 308</B></FONT><P>

although this designation does not fit, for example, such a representative of conceptualist physics as Mach (p. 46). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Rey's identification of energetics with Machism is not altogether correct, of course; nor is his assurance that the neo-mechanistic school as well is approaching a phenomenalist view of physics (p. 48), despite the profundity of its disagreement with the conceptualists. Rey's "new" terminology does not clarify, but rather obscures matters; but we could not avoid it if we were to give the reader an idea of how a "positivist" regards the crisis in physics. Essentially, the opposition of the "new" school to the old views fully coincides, as the reader may have convinced himself, with Kleinpeter's criticism of Helmholtz quoted above. In his presentation of the views of the various physicists Rey reflects the indefiniteness and vacillation of their philosophical views. The <I>essence</I> of the crisis in modern physics consists in the breakdown of the old laws and basic principles, in the rejection of an objective reality existing outside the mind, that is, in the replacement of materialism by idealism and agnosticism. "Matter has disappeared" -- one may thus express the fundamental and characteristic difficulty in relation to many of the particular questions, which has created this crisis. Let us pause to discuss this difficulty.

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Such, literally, is the expression that may be encountered in the descriptions given by modern physicists of recent discoveries. For instance, L. Houllevigue, in his book <I>The Evolution of the Sciences</I>, entitles his chapter on the new theories of matter: "Does Matter Exist?" He says: "The atom 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 309</B></FONT><P>

dematerialises, matter disappears."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp309">*</A>]</FONT> To see how easily fun damental philosophical conclusions are drawn from this by the Machians, let us take Valentinov. He writes: "The statement that the scientific explanation of the world can find a firm foundation only in materialism is nothing but a fiction, and what is more, an absurd fiction" (p. 67). He quotes as a destroyer of this absurd fiction Augusto Righi, the well-known Italian physicist, who says that the electron theory "is not so much a theory of electricity as of matter; the new system simply puts electricity in the place of matter." (Augusto Righi, <I>Die moderne Theorie der physikalischen Erscheinungen</I> [<I>The Modern Theory of Physical Phenomena </I>], Leipzig, 1905, S. 131. There is a Russian translation.) Having quoted these words (p. 64), Mr. Valentinov exclaims: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "Why does Righi permit himself to commit this offence against sacred matter? Is it perhaps because he is a solipsist, an idealist, a bourgeois criticist, an empirio-monist, or even someone worse?" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This remark, which seems to Mr. Valentinov to annihilate the materialists by its sarcasm, only discloses his virgin innocence on the subject of philosophical materialism. Mr. Valentinov has no suspicion of the <I>real</I> connection between philosophical idealism and the "disappearance of matter." The "disappearance of matter" <I>of which he speaks</I>, in imitation of the modern physicists, has no relation to the epistemological distinction between materialism and idealism. To make this clear, let us take one of the most consistent and

clearest of the Machians, Karl Pearson. For him the physical universe consists of groups of sense-impressions. He illustrates "our conceptual model of the physical universe" by the following diagram, explaining, however, that it takes no account of relative sizes (<I>The Grammar of Science</I>, p. 282): --

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In order to simplify his diagram, Karl Pearson entirely omits the question of the relation between ether and electricity, or positive electrons and negative electrons. But that is not important. What is important is that from Pearson's idealist standpoint "bodies" are first regarded as sense-impressions, and then the constitution of these bodies out of particles, particles out of molecules and so forth affects the changes in the model of the physical world, but in no way affects the question of whether bodies are symbols of perceptions, or perceptions images of bodies. Materialism and idealism differ in their respective answers to the question of the <I>source</I> of our knowledge and of the relation of knowledge (and of the "mental" in general) to the <I>physical</I> world; while the question of the structure of matter, of atoms and electrons, is a question that concerns only this "physical world." When the physicists say that "matter is disappearing," they mean that hitherto science reduced its investigations of the physical world to three ultimate concepts: mat-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 311</B></FONT><P>

ter, electricity and ether; whereas now <I>only</I> the two latter remain. For it has become possible to reduce matter to electricity; the atom can be explained as resembling an infinitely small solar system, within which negative electrons move around a positive electron with a definite (and, as we have seen, enormously large) velocity. It is consequently possible to reduce the physical world from scores of elements to two or three elements (inasmuch as positive and negative electrons constitute "two essentially distinct kinds of matter," as the physicist Pellat says -- Rey, <I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 294-95). Hence, natural science leads to the "<I>unity of matter </I>" (<I>ibid</I>.)* -- such is the real meaning of the statement regarding the disappearance of matter, its replacement by electricity, etc., which is leading so many people astray. "Matter is disappearing" means that the limit within which we have hitherto known matter is vanishing and that our knowledge is penetrating deeper; properties of matter are likewise disappearing which formerly seemed absolute, immutable, and primary (impenetrability, inertia, mass, etc.) and which are now revealed to be relative and characteristic only of certain states of matter. For the <I>sole</I> "property" of matter with whose recognition philosophical materialism is bound up is the property of <I>being an objective reality</I>, of existing outside our mind.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The error of Machism in general, as of the Machian new physics, is that it ignores this basis of philosophical materialism and the distinction between metaphysical materialism and dialectical materialism. The recognition of immutable elements, "of the immutable substance of things," and so forth, is not materialism, but <I>metaphysical</I>, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., anti-dialectical, materialism. That is why J. Dietzgen emphasised that the "subject-matter of science is endless," that not only the in finite, but the "smallest atom" is immeasurable, unknowable to the end, <I>inexhaustible</I>, "for nature in all her parts has no beginning and no end" (<I>Kleinere philosophische Schriften</I>, S. 229-30). That is why Engels gave the example of the discovery of alizarin in coal tar and criticised <I>mechanical</I> materialism. In order to present the question in the only correct way, that is, from the dialectical materialist standpoint, we must ask: Do electrons, ether <I>and so on</I> exist as objective realities outside the human mind or not? The scientists will also have to answer this question unhesitatingly; and they do invariably answer it in the <I>affirmative</I>, just as they unhesitatingly recognise that nature existed prior to man and prior to organic matter. Thus, the question is decided in favour of materialism, for the concept matter, as we already stated, epistemologically implies <I>nothing but</I> objective reality existing independently of the human mind and renected by it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But dialectical materialism insists on the approximate, relative character of every scientific theory of the structure of matter and its properties; it insists on the absence of absolute boundaries in nature, on the transformation of moving matter from one state into another, which is to us apparently irreconcilable with it, and so forth. However bizarre from the standpoint of "common sense" the transformation of imponderable ether into ponderable matter and <I>vice versa</I> may 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 313</B></FONT><P>

appear, however "strange" may seem the absence of any other kind of mass in the electron save electromagnetic mass, however extraordinary may be the fact that the mechanical laws of motion are confined only to a single sphere of natural phenomena and are subordinated to the more profound laws of electromagnetic phenomena, and so forth -- all this is but another <I>corroboration</I> of dialectical materialism. It is mainly because the physicists did not know dialectics that the new physics strayed into idealism. They combated metaphysical (in Engels', and not the positivist, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., Humean, sense of the word) materialism and its one-sided "mechanism," and in so doing threw the baby out with the bath-water. Denying the immutability of the elements and the properties of matter known hitherto, they ended in denying matter, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the objective reality of the physical world. Denying the absolute character of some of the most important and basic laws, they ended in denying all objective law in nature and in declaring that a law of nature is a mere convention, "a limitation of expectation," "a logical necessity," and so forth. Insisting on the approximate and relative character of our knowledge, they ended in denying the object independent of the mind and reflected approximately-correctly and relatively-truthfully by the mind. And so on, and so forth, without end. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The opinions expressed by Bogdanov in 1899 regarding "the immutable essence of things," the opinions of Valentinov and Yushkevich regarding "substance," and so forth -- are similar fruits of ignorance of dialectics. From Engels' point of view, the only immutability is the reflection by the human mind (when there is a human mind) of an external world existing and developing independently of the mind. No other "immutability," no other "essence," no other "absolute substance," in the sense in which these concepts were depicted 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 314</B></FONT><P>

by the empty professorial philosophy, exist for Marx and Engels. The "essence" of things, or "substance," is <I>also</I> relative; it expresses only the degree of profundity of man's knowledge of objects; and while yesterday the profundity of this knowledge did not go beyond the atom, and today does not go beyond the electron and ether, dialectical materialism insists on the temporary, relative, approximate character of all these <I>milestones</I> in the knowledge of nature gained by the progressing science of man. The electron is as <I>inexhaustible</I> as the atom, nature is infinite, but it infinitely <I>exists</I>. And it is this sole categorical, this sole unconditional recognition of nature's <I>existence</I> outside the mind and perception of man that distinguishes dialectical materialism from relativist agnosticism and idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us cite two examples of the way in which the new physics wavers unconsciously and instinctively between dialectical materialism, which remains unknown to the bourgeois scientists, and "phenomenalism," with its inevitable subjectivist (and, subsequently, directly fideist) deductions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This same Augusto Righi, from whom Mr. Valentinov was <I>unable</I> to get a reply on the question which interested him about materialism, writes in the introduction to his book: "What the electrons, or electrical atoms, really are remains even now a mystery; but in spite of this, the new theory is perhaps destined in time to achieve no small philosophical significance, since it is arriving at entirely new hypotheses regarding the structure of ponderable matter and is striving to reduce all phenomena of the external world to one common origin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "For the positivist and utilitarian tendencies of our time such an advantage may be of small consequence, and a theory is perhaps regarded primarily as a means of conveniently 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 315</B></FONT><P>

ordering and summarising facts and as a guide in the search for further phenomena. But while in former times perhaps too much confidence was placed in the faculties of the human mind, and it was considered too easy to grasp the ultimate causes of all things, there is nowadays a tendency to fall into the opposite error" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 3). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Why does Righi dissociate himself here from the positivist and utilitatian tendencies? Because, while apparently he has no definite philosophical standpoint, he instinctively clings to the reality of the external world and to the recognition that the new theory is not only a "convenience" (Poincar&eacute), not only an "empirio-symbol" (Yushkevich), not only a "harmonising of experience" (Bogdanov), or whatever else they call such subjectivist fancies, but a further step in the cognition of objective reality. Had this physicist been acquainted with <I>dialectical</I> materialism, his opinion of the error which is the opposite of the old metaphysical materialism might perhaps have become the starting point of a correct philosophy. But these people's whole environment estranges them from Marx and Engels and throws them into the embrace of vulgar official philosophy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Rey too is entirely unfamiliar with dialectics. But he too is compelled to state that among the modern physicists there are those who continue the traditions of "mechanism" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., materialism). The path of "mechanism," says he, is pursued not only by Kirchhoff, Hertz, Boltzmann, Maxwell, Helmholtz and Lord Kelvin. "Pure mechanists, and in some respects more mechanist than anybody else, and representing the culmination (<I>l'aboutissant </I>) of mechanism, are those who follow Lorentz and Larmor in formulating an electrical theory of matter and who arrive at a denial of the constancy of mass, declaring it to be a function of motion. <I>They are all mechan-</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 316</B></FONT><P>

<I>ists because they take real motion as their starting point </I>" (Rey's italics, pp. 290-91). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . If, for example, the recent hypotheses of Lorentz, Larmor and Langevin were, thanks to certain experimental confirmation, to obtain a sufficiently stable basis for the systematisation of physics, it would be certain that the laws bf present-day mechanics are nothing but a corollary of the laws of electromagnetism: they would constitute a special case of the latter within well-defined limits. Constancy of mass and our principle of inertia would be valid only for moderate velocities of bodies, the term 'moderate' being taken in relation to our senses and to the phenomena which constitute our general experience. A general recasting of mechanics would result, and hence also, a general recasting of the systematisation of physics." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Would this imply the abandonment of mechanism? By no means. The purely mechanist tradition would still be followed, and mechanism would follow its normal course of development" (p. 295). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Electronic physics, which should be ranked among the theories of a generally mechanist spirit, tends at present to impose its systematisation on physics. Although the fundamental principles of this electronic physics are not furnished by mechanics but by the experimental data of the theory of electricity, its spirit is mechanistic, because: (1) It uses <I>figurative</I> (<I>figur&eacutes </I>), <I>material</I> elements to represent physical properties and their laws; it expresses itself in terms of perception. (2) While it no longer regards physical phenomena as particular cases of mechanical phenomena, it regards mechanical phenomena as particular cases of physical phenomena. The laws of mechanics thus retain their <I>direct continuity</I> with the laws of physics; and the concepts of mechanics 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 317</B></FONT><P>

remain concepts of the same order as physico-chemical concepts. In traditional mechanism it was motions copied (<I>calqu&eacutes </I>) from <I>relatively slow</I> motions, which, since they alone were known and most directly observable, were taken. . . as a type of all possible motions. <I>Recent experiments</I>, on the contrary, show that it is necessary to <I>extend</I> our conception of possible motions. Traditional mechanics remains entirely intact, but it now applies only to relatively slow motions. . . . In relation to large velocities, the laws of motion are different. Matter appears to be reduced to electrical particles, the ultimate elements of the atom. . . . (3) Motion, displacement in space, remains the only figurative (<I>figur&eacute </I>) element of physical theory. (4) Finally, what from the standpoint of the general spirit of physics comes before every other consideration is the fact that the conception of physics, its methods, its theories, and their relation to experience remains <I>absolutely identical</I> with the conception of mechanism, with the conception of physics held since the Renaissance" (pp. 46-47). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I have given this long quotation from Rey in full because owing to his perpetual anxiety to avoid "materialist metaphysics," it would have been impossible to expound his statements in any other way. But however much both Rey and the physicists of whom he speaks abjure materialism, it is nevertheless beyond question that mechanics was a copy of real motions of moderate velocity, while the new physics is a copy of real motions of enormous velocity. The recognition of theory as a copy, as an approximate copy of objective reality, is materialism. When Rey says that among modern physicists there "is a reaction against the conceptualist [Machian] and energeticist school," and when he ranks the physicists of the electron theory among the representatives of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 318</B></FONT><P>

this reaction (p. 46), we could desire no better corroboration of the fact that the struggle is essentially between the materialist and the idealist tendencies. But we must not forget that, apart from the general prejudices against materialism common to all educated philistines, the most outstanding theoreticians are handicapped by a complete ignorance of dialectics.

                         3.&nbsp;IS MOTION WITHOUT MATTER CONCEIVABLE?
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The fact that philosophical idealism is attempting to make use of the new physics, or that idealist conclusions are being drawn from the latter, is due not to the discovery of new kinds of substance and force, of matter and motion, but to the fact that an attempt is being made to conceive motion without matter. And it is the essence of this attempt which our Machians fail to examine. They were unwilling to take account of Engels' statement that "motion without matter is unthinkable." J. Dietzgen in 1869, in his <I>The Nature of tbe Workings of the Human Mind</I>, expressed the same idea as Engels, although, it is true, not without his usual muddled attempts to "reconcile" materialism and idealism. Let us leave aside these attempts, which are to a large extent to be explained by the fact that Dietzgen is arguing against B&uumlchner's non-dialectical materialism, and let us examine Dietzgen's own statements on the question under consideration. He says: "They [the idealists] want to have the general without the particular, mind without matter, force without substance, science without experience or material, the absolute without the relative" (<I>Das Wesen der menschlichen Kopfarbeit</I>, 1903, S. 108). Thus the endeavour to divorce mo-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 319</B></FONT><P>

tion from matter, force from substance, Dietzgen associates with idealism, compares with the endeavour to divorce thought from the brain. "Liebig," Dietzgen continues, "who is especially fond of straying from his inductive science into the field of speculation, says in the spirit of idealism: 'force cannot be seen'" (p. 109). "The spiritualist or the idealist believes in the spiritual, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., ghostlike and inexplicable, nature of force" (p. 110). "The antithesis between force and matter is as old as the antithesis between idealism and materialism" (p. 111). "Of course, there is no force without matter, no matter without force; forceless matter and matterless force are absurdities. If there are idealist natural scientists who believe in the immaterial existence of forces, on this point they are not natural scientists. . . but seers of ghosts" (p. 114). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We thus see that scientists who were prepared to grant that motion is conceivable without matter were to be encountered forty years ago too, and that "on this point" Dietzgen declared them to be seers of ghosts. What, then, is the connection between philosophical idealism and the divorce of matter from motion, the separation of substance from force? Is it not "more economical," indeed, to conceive motion without matter? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us imagine a consistent idealist who holds that the entire world is his sensation, his idea, etc. (if we take "nobody's" sensation or idea, this changes only the variety of philosophical idealism but not its essence). The idealist would not even think of denying that the world is motion, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the motion of his thoughts, ideas, sensations. The question as to <I>what</I> moves, the idealist will reject and regard as absurd: what is taking place is a change of his sensations, his ideas come and go, and nothing more. Outside him there is nothing. "It moves" -- and that is all. It is impossible to conceive 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 320</B></FONT><P>

a more "economical" way of thinking. And no proofs, syllogisms, or definitions are capable of refuting the solipsist if he consistently adheres to his view. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The fundamental distinction between the materialist and the adherent of idealist philosophy consists in the fact that the materialist regards sensation, perception, idea, and the mind of man generally, as an image of objective reality. The world is the movement of this objective reality reflected by our consciousness. To the movement of ideas, perceptions, etc., there corresponds the movement of matter outside me. The concept matter expresses nothing more than the objective reality which is given us in sensation. Therefore, to divorce motion from matter is equivalent to divorcing thought from objective reality, or to divorcing my sensations from the external world -- in a word, it is to go over to idealism. The trick which is usually performed in denying matter, and in assuming motion without matter, consists in ignoring the relation of matter to thought. The question is presented as though this relation did not exist, but in reality it is introduced surreptitiously; at the beginning of the argument it remains unexpressed, but subsequently crops up more or less imperceptibly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Matter has disappeared, they tell us, wishing from this to draw epistemological conclusions. But has thought remained? -- we ask. If not, if with the disappearance of matter thought has also disappeared, if with the disappearance of the brain and nervous system ideas and sensations, too, have disappeared -- then it follows that everything has disappeared. And your argument has disappeared as a sample of "thought" (or lack of thought)! But if it has remained -- if it is assumed that with the disappearance of matter, thought (idea, sensation, etc.) does not disappear, then you have surrepti-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 321</B></FONT><P>

tiously gone over to the standpoint of philosophical idealism. And this always happens with people who wish, for "economy's sake," to conceive of motion without matter, for <I>tacitly</I>, by the very fact that they continue to argue, they are acknowledging the existence of thought <I>after</I> the disappearance of matter. This means that a very simple, or a very complex philosophical idealism is taken as a basis; a very simple one, if it is a case of frank solipsism (<I>I</I> exist, and the world is only <I>my</I> sensation); a very complex one, if instead of the thought, ideas and sensations of a living person, a dead abstraction is posited, that is, nobody's thought, nobody's idea, nobody's sensation, but thought in general (the Absolute Idea, the Universal Will, etc.), sensation as an indeterminate "element," the "psychical," which is substituted for the whole of physical nature, etc., etc. Thousands of shades of varieties of philosophical idealism are possible and it is always possible to create a thousand and first shade; and to the author of this thousand and first little system (empirio-monism, for example) what distinguishes it from the rest may appear to be momentous. From the standpoint of materialism, however, the distinction is absolutely unessential. What is essential is the point of departure. What is essential is that the attempt to <I>think</I> of motion without matter smuggles in <I>thought</I> divorced from matter -- and that is philosophical idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Therefore, for example, the English Machian Karl Pearson, the clearest and most consistent of the Machians, who is averse to verbal trickery, directly begins the seventh chapter of his book, devoted to "matter," with the characteristic heading "All things move -- but only in conception." "It is therefore, for the sphere of perception, idle to ask what moves and why it moves" (<I>The Grammar of Science</I>, p. 243). 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 322</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Therefore, too, in the case of Bogdanov, his philosophical misadventures in fact began before his acquaintance with Mach. They began from the moment he put his trust in the assertion of the eminent chemist, but poor philosopher, Ostwald, that motion can be thought of without matter. It is all the more fitting to pause on this long-past episode in Bogdanov's philosophical development since it is impossible when speaking of the connection between philosophical idealism and certain trends in the new physics to ignore Ostwald's "energetics." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "We have already said," wrote Bogdanov in 1899, "that the nineteenth century did not succeed in ultimately ridding itself of the problem of 'the immutable essence of things.' This essence, under the name of 'matter,' even holds an important place in the world outlook of the foremost thinkers of the century" (<I>Fundamental Elements of the Historical Outlook on Nature</I>, p. 38). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We said that this is a sheer muddle. The recognition of the objective reality of the outer world, the recognition of the existence outside our mind of eternally moving and eternally changing matter, is here confused with the recognition of the immutable essence of things. It is hardly possible that Bogdanov in 1899 did not rank Marx and Engels among the "foremost thinkers." But he obviously did not understand dialectical materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . In the processes of nature two aspects are usually still distinguished: matter and-its motion. It cannot be said that the concept matter is distinguished by great clarity. It is not easy to give a satisfactory answer to the question -- what is matter? It is defined as the 'cause of sensations' or as the 'permanent possibility of sensation'; but it is evident that matter is here confused with motion. . . ." 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 323</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  It is evident that Bogdanov is arguing incorrectly. Not only does he confuse the materialist recognition of an objective source of sensations (unclearly formulated in the words "cause of sensations") with Mill's agnostic definition of matter as the permanent <I>possibility</I> of sensation, but the chief error here is that the author, having boldly approached the question of the existence or non-existence of an objective source of sensations, abandons this question half-way and jumps to another question, the question of the existence or non-existence of matter without motion. The idealist may regard the world as the <I>movement</I> of our sensations (even though "socially organised" and "harmonised" to the highest degree); the materialist regards the world as the movement of an objective source, of an objective model of our sensations. The metaphysical, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., anti-dialectical, materialist may accept the existence of matter without motion (even though temporarily, before "the first impulse," etc.). The dialectical materialist not only regards motion as an inseparable property of matter, but rejects the simplified view of motion and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . The most exact definition would, perhaps, be the following: 'matter is what moves'; but this is as devoid of content as though one were to say that matter is the subject of a sentence, the predicate of which is 'moves.' The fact, most likely, is that in the epoch of statics men were wont to see something necessarily solid in the role of the subject, an 'object,' and such an inconvenient thing for statical thought as 'motion' they were prepared to tolerate only as a predicate, as one of the attributes of 'matter.'" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is something like the charge Akimov brought against the <I>Iskra</I>-ists, namely, that their programme did not contain the word proletariat in the nominative case! Whether we 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 324</B></FONT><P>

say the world is moving matter, or that the world is material motion, makes no difference whatever. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . But energy must have a vehicle -- say those who believe in matter. Why? -- asks Ostwald, and with reason. Must nature necessarily consist of subject and predicate?" (p. 39) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Ostwald's answer, which so pleased Bogdanov in 1899, is plain sophistry. Must our judgments necessarily consist of electrons and ether? -- one might retort to Ostwald. As a matter of fact, the mental elimination from "nature" of matter as the "subject" only implies the tacit admission into <I>philosophy of thought</I> as the "subject" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., as the primary, the starting point, independent of matter). Not the subject, but the objective source of sensation is eliminated, and <I>sensation</I> becomes the "subject," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., philosophy becomes Berke leian, no matter in what trappings the word "sensation" is afterwards decked. Ostwald endeavoured to avoid this inevitable philosophical alternative (materialism or idealism) by an indefinite use of the word "energy," but this very endeavour only once again goes to prove the futility of such artifices. If energy is motion, you have only shifted the difficulty from the subject to the predicate, you have only changed the question, does matter move? into the question, is energy material? Does the transformation of energy take place outside my mind, independently of man and mankind, or are these only ideas, symbols, conventional signs, and so forth? And this question proved fatal to the "energeticist" philosophy, that attempt to disguise old epistemological errors by a "new" terminology. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here are examples of how the energeticist Ostwald got into a muddle. In the preface to his <I>Lectures on Natural</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 325</B></FONT><P>

<I>Philosophy </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp325">*</A>]</FONT> he declares that he regards "as a great gain the simple and natural removal of the old difficulties in the way of uniting the concepts matter and spirit by subordinating both to the concept energy." This is not a gain, but a loss, because the question whether epistemological investigation (Ostwald does not clearly realise that he is raising an epistemological and not a chemical issue!) is to be conducted along materialist or idealist lines is not being solved but is being confused by an arbitrary use of the term "energy." Of course, if we "subordinate" both matter and mind to this concept, the <I>verbal</I> annihilation of the antithesis is beyond question, but the absurdity of the belief in sprites and hobgoblins, for instance, is not removed by calling it "energetics." On page 394 of Ostwald's <I>Lectures</I> we read: "That all external events may be presented as an interaction of energies can be most simply explained if our mental processes are themselves energetic and impose (<I>aufpr&aumlgen </I>) this property of theirs on all external phenornena." This is pure idealism: it is not our thought that reflects the transformation of energy in the external world, but the external world that reflects a certain "property" of our mind! The American philosopher Hibben, pointing to this and similar passages in Ostwald's <I>Lectures</I>, aptly says that Ostwald "appears in a Kantian disguise": the explicability of the phenomena of the external world is deduced from the properties of our mind! "It is obvious therefore," says Hibben, "that if the primary concept of energy is so defined as to embrace psychical phenomena, we have no longer the simple concept of energy as understood and recognised in scientific circles or even

among the <I>Energetiker</I> themselves. . . ."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp326">*</A>]</FONT> The transformation of energy is regarded by science as an objective process independent of the minds of men and of the experience of mankind, that is to say, it is regarded materialistically. And by energy, Ostwald himself in many instances, probably in the vast majority of instances, means <I>material</I> motion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And this accounts for the remarkable phenomenon that Bogdanov, a disciple of Ostwald, having become a disciple of Mach, began to reproach Ostwald not because he does not adhere consistently to a materialistic view of energy, but because he admits the materialistic view of energy (and at times even takes it as his basis). The materialists criticise Ostwald because he lapses into idealism, because he attempts to reconcile materialism and idealism. Bogdanov criticises Ostwald from the <I>idealist</I> standpoint. In 1906 he wrote: ". . . Ostwald's energetics, hostile to atomism but for the rest closely akin to the old materialism, enlisted my heartiest sympathy. I soon noticed, however, an important contradiction in his <I>Naturphilosohhie </I>: although he frequently emphasises the <I>purely methodological</I> significance of the concept 'energy,' in a great number of instances he himself fails to adhere to it. He every now and again converts 'energy' from a pure symbol of correlations between the facts of experience into the <I>substance</I> of experience, into the 'world stuff'" (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, pp. xvi-xvii). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Energy is a pure symbol! After this Bogdanov may dispute as much as he pleases with the "empirio-symbolist" Yushkevich, with the "pure Machians," the empirio-criticists, etc. -- from the standpoint of the materialist it is a dispute be-

tween a man who believes in a yellow devil and a man who believes in a green devil. For the important thing is not the differences between Bogdanov and the other Machians, but what they have in common, to wit: the <I>idealist</I> interpretation of "experience" and "energy," the denial of objective reality, adaptation to which constitutes human experience and the copying of which constitutes the only scientific "methodology" and scientific "energetics." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It [Ostwald's energetics] is indifferent to the material of the world, it is fully compatible with both the old materialism and pan-psychism" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., philosophical idealism?) (p. xvii). And Bogdanov departed from muddled energetics <I>not</I> by the materialist road <I>but by the idealist</I> road. . . . "When energy is represented as substance it is nothing but the old materialism minus the absolute atoms -- materialism with a correction in the sense of the <I>continuity</I> of the existing" (<I>ibid</I>.). Yes, Bogdanov left the "old" materialism, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the metaphysical materialism of the scientists, not for <I>dialectical</I> materialism, which he understood as little in 1906 as he did in 1899, but for idealism and fideism; for no educated representative of modern fideism, no immanentist, no "neo-criticist," and so forth, will object to the "methodological" conception of energy, to its interpretation as a "pure symbol of correlation of the facts of experience." Take Paul Carus, with whose mental make-up we have already become sufficiently acquainted, and you will find that this Machian criticises Ostwald <I>in the very same way as Bogdanov </I>: ". . . Materialism and energetics are exactly in the same predicament" (<I>The Monist</I>, Vol. XVII, 1907, No. 4, p. 536). "We are very little helped by materialism when we are told that everything is matter, that bodies are matter, and that thoughts are merely a function of matter, and Professor Ost-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 328</B></FONT><P>

wald's energetics is not a whit better when it tells us that matter is energy, and that the soul too is only a factor of energy" (p. 533). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Ostwald's energetics is a good example of how quickly a "new" terminology becomes fashionable, and how quickly it turns out that a somewhat altered mode of expression can in no way eliminate fundamental philosophical questions and fundamental philosophical trends. Both materialism and idealism can be expressed in terms of "energetics" (more or less consistently, of course) just as they can be expressed in terms of "experience," and the like. Energeticist physics is a source of new idealist attempts to conceive motion without matter -- because of the disintegration of particles of matter which hitherto had been accounted non-disintegrable and because of the discovery of heretofore unknown forms of material motion.

  In order to illustrate concretely the philosophical battle raging in present-day literature over the various conclusions drawn from the new physics, we shall let certain of the direct participants in the "fray" speak for themselves, and we shall begin with the English. The physicist Arthur W. R&uumlcker defends one trend -- from the standpoint of the natural scientist; the philosopher James Ward another trend -- from the standpoint of epistemology. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the meeting of the British Association held in Glasgow in 1901, A. W. R&uumlcker, the president of the physics section, chose as the subject of his address the question of the value

of physical theory and especially the doubts that have arisen as to the existence of atoms, and of the ether. The speaker referred to the physicists Poincar&eacute and Poynting (an English man who shares the views of the symbolists, or Machians), who raised this problem, to the philosopher Ward, and to E. Haeckel's famous book and attempted to present his own views.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp329">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The question at issue," said R&uumlcker, "is whether the hypotheses which are at the base of the scientihc theories now most generally accepted, are to be regarded as accurate descriptions of the constitution of the universe around us, or merely as convenient fictions." (In the terms used in our controversy with Bogdanov, Yushkevich and Co.: are they a copy of objective reality, of moving matter, or are they only a "methodology," a "pure symbol," mere "forms of organisation of experience"?) R&uumlcker agrees that in practice there may prove to be no difference between the two theories; the direction of a river can be determined as well by one who examines only the blue streak on a map or diagram as by one who knows that this streak represents a real river. Theory, from the standpoint of a convenient fiction, will be an "aid to memory," a means of "producing order" in our observations in accordance with some artificial system, of "arranging our knowledge," reducing it to equations, etc. We can, for instance, confine ourselves to declaring heat to be a form of motion or energy, thus exchanging "a vivid conception of moving atoms for a colourless statement of heat energy, the real nature of which we do not attempt to

define." While fully recognising the possibility of achieving great scientific successes by this method, R&uumlcker "ventures to assert that the exposition of such a system of tactics cannot be regarded as the last word of science in the struggle for the truth." The questions still force themselves upon us: "Can we argue back from the phenomenon displayed by matter to the constitution of matter itself; whether we have any reason to believe that the sketch which science has already drawn is to some extent a copy, and not a mere dia gram of the truth?" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Analysing the problem of the structure of matter, R&uumlcker takes air as an example, saying that it consists of gases and that science resolves "an elementary gas into a mixture of atoms and ether. . . . There are those who cry 'Halt'; molecules and atoms cannot be directly perceived; they are mere conceptions, which have their uses, but cannot be regarded as realities." R&uumlcker meets this objection by referring to one of numberless instances in the development of science: the rings of Saturn appear to be a continuous mass when observed through a telescope. The mathematicians proved by calculation that this is impossible and spectral analysis corroborated the conclusion reached on the basis of the calculations. Another objection: properties are attributed to atoms and ether such as our senses do not disclose in ordinary matter. R&uumlcker answers this also, referring to such examples as the diffusion of gases and liquids, etc. A number of facts, observations and experiments prove that matter consists of discrete particles or grains. Whether these particles, atoms, are distinct from the surrounding "original medium" or "basic medium" (ether), or whether they are parts of this medium in a particular state, is still an open question, and has no bearing on the theory of the existence of atoms. There is 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 331</B></FONT><P>

no ground for denying <I>a priori</I> the evidence of experiments showing that "quasi-material substances" exist which differ from ordinary matter (atoms and ether). Particular errors are here inevitable, but the aggregate of scientific data leaves no room for doubting the existence of atoms and molecules. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   R&uumlcker then refers to the new data on the structure of atoms, which consist of corpuscles (electrons) charged with negative electricity, and notes the similarities in the results of various experiments and calculations on the size of molecules: the "first approximation" gives a diameter of about 100 millimicrons (millionths of a millimetre). Omitting R&uumlcker's particular remarks and his criticism of neo-vitalism, we quote his conclusions: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Those who belittle the ideas which have of late governed the advance of scientific theory, too often assume that there is no alternative between the opposing assertions that atoms and the ether are mere figments of the scientific imagination, and that, on the other hand, a mechanical theory of the atoms and the ether, which is now confessedly imperfect, would, if it could be perfected, give us a full and adequate representation of the underlying realities. For my part I believe that there is a <I>via media</I>." A man in a dark room may discern objects dimly, but if he does not stumble over the furniture and does not walk into a looking-glass instead of through a door, it means that he sees some things correctly. There is no need, therefore, either to renounce the claim to penetrate below the surface of nature, or to claim that we have already fully unveiled the mystery of the world around us. "It may be granted that we have not yet framed a consistent image either of the nature of the atoms or of the ether in which they exist, but I have tried to show that in spite of the tentative nature of some of our theories, in spite of many 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 332</B></FONT><P>

outstanding difficulties, the atomic theory unifies so many facts, simplifies so much that is complicated, that we have a right to insist -- at all events until an equally intelligible rival hypothesis is produced -- that the main structure of our theory is true; that atoms are not merely aids to puzzled mathematicians, but physical realities." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is how R&uumlcker ended his address. The reader will see that the speaker did not deal with epistemology, but as a matter of fact, doubtless in the name of a host of scientists, he was essentially expounding an instinctive materialist standpoint. The gist of his position is this: The theory of physics is a copy (becoming ever more exact) of objective reality. The world is matter in motion, our knowledge of which grows ever more profound. The inaccuracies of R&uumlcker's philosophy are due to an unnecessary defence of the "mechanical" (why not electromagnetic?) theory of ether motions and to a failure to understand the relation between relative and absolute truth. This physicist lacks <I>only</I> a knowledge of <I>dialectical</I> materialism (if we do not count, of course, those very important social considerations which induce English professors to call themselves "agnostics"). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us now see how the spiritualist James Ward criticised I this philosophy: "Naturalism is not science, and the mechanical theory of Nature, the theory which serves as its foundation, is no science either. . . . Nevertheless, though Naturalism and the natural sciences, the Mechanical Theory of the Universe and mechanics as a science are logically distinct, yet the two are at first sight very similar and historically are very closely connected. Between the natural sciences and philosophies of the idealist (or spiritualist) type there is indeed no danger of confusion, for all such philosophies necessarily involve criticism of the epistemological assump-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 333</B></FONT><P>

tions which science unconsciously makes."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp333">*</A>]</FONT> True! The natural sciences <I>unconsciously</I> assume that their teachings reflect objective reality, and <I>only</I> such a philosophy is reconcilable with the natural sciences!" . . . Not so with Naturalism, which is as innocent of any theory of knowledge as science itself. In fact Naturalism, like Materialism, is only physics treated as metaphysics. . . . Naturalism is less dogmatic than Materialism, no doubt, owing to its agnostic reservation as to the nature of ultimate reality; but it insists emphatically on the priority of the material aspect of its Unknowable." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The materialist treats physics as metaphysics! A familiar argument. By metaphysics is meant the recognition of an objective reality outside man. The spiritualists agree with the Kantians and Humeans in such reproaches against materialism. This is understandable; for without doing away with the <I>objective</I> reality of things, bodies and objects known to everyone, it is impossible to clear the road for "real conceptions" in Rehmke's sense! . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "When the essentially philosophical question, how best to systematise experience as a whole [a plagiarism from Bogdanov, Mr. Ward!], arises, the naturalist . . . contends that we must begin from the physical side. Then only are the facts precise, determinate, and rigorously concatenated: every thought that ever stirred the human heart . . . can, it holds, be traced to a perfectly definite redistribution of matter and motion. . . . That propositions of such philosophic generality and scope are legitimate deductions from physical science, few, if any, of our modern physicists are bold enough directly to maintain. But many of them consider that their science

itself is attacked by those who seek to lay bare the latent metaphysics, the physical realism, on which the Mechanical Theory of the Universe rests. . . . The criticism of this theory in the preceding lectures has been so regarded [by R&uumlcker]. . . . In point of fact my criticism [of this "metaphysics," so detested by all the Machians too] rests throughout on the expositions of a school of physicists -- if one might call them so -- steadily increasing in number and influence, who reject entirely the almost medieval realism. . . . This realism has remained so long unquestioned, that to challenge it now seems to many to spell scientific anarchy. And yet it surely verges on extravagance to suppose that men like Kirchhoff or Poincar&eacute -- to mention only two out of many distinguished names -- who do challenge it, are seeking 'to invalidate the methods of science.' . . . To distinguish them from the old school, whom we may fairly term physical realists, we might call the new school physical symbolists. The term is not very happy, but it may at least serve to emphasise the one difference between the two which now specially concerns us. The question at issue is very simple. Both schools start, of course, from the same perceptual experiences; both employ an abstract conceptual system, differing in detail but essentially the same; both resort to the same methods of verification. But the one believes that it is getting nearer to the ultimate reality and leaving mere appearances behind it; the other believes that it is only substituting a generalised descriptive scheme that is intellectually manageable, for the complexity of concrete facts. . . . In either view the value of physics as systematic knowledge <I>about</I> [Ward's italics] things is unaffected; its possibilities of future extension and of practical application are in either case the same. But the speculative difference between the two is 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 335</B></FONT><P>

immense, and in this respect the question which is right becomes important." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The question is put by this frank and consistent spiritualist with remarkable truth and clarity. Indeed, the difference between the two schools in modern physics is <I>only</I> philosophical, only epistemological. Indeed, the basic distinction is <I>only</I> that one recognises the "ultimate" (he should have said objective) reality reflected by our theory, while the other denies it, regarding theory as only a systematisation of experience, a system of empirio-symbols, and so on and so forth. The new physics, having found new aspects of matter and new forms of its motion, raised the old philosophical questions because of the collapse of the old physical concepts. And if the people belonging to "intermediate" philosophical trends ("positivists," Humeans, Machians) are unable to put the question at issue distinctly, it remained for the outspoken idealist Ward to tear off all veils. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . Sir A. W. R&uumlcker . . . devoted his Inaugural Address to a defence of physical realism against the symbolic inter pretations recently advocated by Professors Poincar&eacute and Poynting and by myself" (pp. 305-06; and in other parts of his book Ward adds to this list the names of Duhem, Pearson and Mach; see Vol. II, pp. 161, 63, 57, 75, 83, etc.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . He [R&uumlcker] is constantly talking of 'mental pictures,' while constantly protesting that atoms and ether must be more than these. Such procedure practically amounts to saying: In this case I can form no other picture, and therefore the reality must be like it. . . . He [R&uumlcker] is fair enough to allow the abstract possibility of a different mental picture. . . . Nay, he allows 'the tentative nature of some of our theories'; he admits 'many outstanding difficulties.' After all, then, he is only defending a working hypothesis, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 336</B></FONT><P>

and one, moreover, that has lost greatly in prestige in the last half century. But if the atomic and other theories of the constitution of matter are but working hypotheses, and hypotheses strictly confined to physical phenomena, there is no justification for a theory which maintains that mechanism is fundamental everywhere and reduces the facts of life and mind to epiphenomena -- makes them, that is to say, a degree more phenomenal, a degree less real than matter and motion. Such is the mechanical theory of the universe. Save as he seems unwittingly to countenance that, we have then no quarrel with Sir Arthur R&uumlcker" (pp. 314-15). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is, of course, utterly absurd to say that materialism ever maintained that consciousness is "less" real, or necessarily professed a "mechanical," and not an electromagnetic, or some other, immeasurably more complex, picture of the world of <I>moving matter</I>. But in a truly adroit manner, much more skilfully than our Machians (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., muddled idealists), the outspoken and straightforward idealist Ward <I>seizes upon</I> the weak points in "instinctive" natural-historical materialism, as, for instance, its inability to explain the relation of relative and absolute truth. Ward turns somersaults and declares that since truth is relative, approximate, only "tentative," it cannot reflect reality! But, on the other hand, the question of atoms, etc., as "a working hypothesis" is very correctly put by the spiritualist. Modern, cultured fideism (which Ward directly deduces from his spiritualism) <I>does not think of demanding</I> anything more than the declaration that the concepts of natural science are "working hypotheses." We will, sirs, surrender science to you scientists provided you surrender epistemology, philosophy to us -- such is the condition for the cohabitation of the theologians and professors in the "advanced" capitalist countries. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 337</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Among the other points on which Ward connects his epistemology with the "new" physics must be counted his deter mined attack on <I>matter</I>. What is matter and what is energy? -- asks Ward, mocking at the plethora of hypotheses and their contradictoriness. Is it ether or ethers? -- or, perhaps, some new "perfect fluid," arbitrarily endowed with new and improbable qualities? And Ward's conclusion is: " . . . we find nothing definite except movement left. Heat is a mode of motion, elasticity is a mode of motion, light and magnetism are modes of motion. Nay, mass itself is, in the end, supposed to be but a mode of motion of a something that is neither solid, nor liquid nor gas, that is neither itself a body nor an aggregate of bodies, that is not phenomenal and must not be noumenal, a veritable apeiron [a term used by the Greek philosophers signifying: infinite, boundless] on which we can impose our own terms" (Vol. I, p. 140). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The spiritualist is true to himself when he divorces motion from matter. The movement of bodies is transformed in nature into a movement of something that is not a body with a constant mass, into a movement of an unknown charge of an unknown electricity in an unknown ether -- this dialectics of <I>material</I> transformation, performed in the laboratory and in the factory, serves in the eyes of the idealist (as in the eyes of the public at large, and of the Machians) not as a confirmation of materialist dialectics, but as evidence against materialism: " . . . The mechanical theory, as a professed explanation of the world, receives its death-blow from the progress of mechanical physics itself" (p. 143). The world is matter in motion, we reply, and the laws of its motion are reflected by mechanics in the case of moderate velocities and by the electromagnetic theory in the case of great velocities. "Extended, solid, indestructible atoms have always been the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 338</B></FONT><P>

stronghold of materialistic views of the universe. But, un happily for such views, the hard, extended atom was not equal to the demands which increasing knowledge made upon it" (p. 144). The destructibility of the atom, its inexhaustibility, the mutability of all forms of matter and of its motion, have always been the stronghold of dialectical materialism. All boundaries in nature are conditional, relative, movable, and express the gradual approximation of our mind towards the knowledge of matter. But this does not in any way prove that nature, matter itself, is a symbol, a conventional sign, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the product of our mind. The electron is to the atom as a full stop in this book is to the size of a building 200 feet long, 100 feet broad, and 50 feet high (Lodge); it moves with a velocity as high as 270,000 kilometres per second; its mass is a function of its velocity; it makes 500 trillion revolutions in a second -- all this is much more complicated than the old mechanics; but it is, nevertheless, movement of matter in space and time. Human reason has discovered many amazing things in nature and will discover still more, and will thereby increase its power over nature. But this does not mean that nature is the creation of our mind or of abstract mind, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of Ward's God, Bogdanov's "substitution," etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Rigorously carried out as a theory of the real world, that ideal [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the ideal of "mechanism"] lands us in nihilism: all changes are motions, for motions are the only changes we can understand, and so what moves, to be understood, must itself be motion" (p. 166). "As I have tried to show, and as I believe, the very advance of physics is proving the most effectual cure for this ignorant faith in matter and motion as the inmost substance rather than the most abstract 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 339</B></FONT><P>

symbols of the sum of existence. . . . We can never get to God through a mere mechanism" (p. 180). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Well, well, this is exactly in the spirit of the <I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism </I>! Mr. Ward, you ought to address yourself to Lunacharsky, Yushkevich, Bazarov and Bogdanov. They are a little more "shamefaced" than you are, but they preach the same doctrine.

                             5.&nbsp;THE TWO TRENDS IN MODERN PHYSICS,<BR>
                                         AND GERMAN IDEALISM
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In 1896, the well-known Kantian idealist Hermann Cohen, with unusually triumphant exultation, wrote an introduction to the fifth edition of the <I>Geschichte des Materialismus</I>, the falsified history of materialism written by F. Albert Lange. "Theoretical idealism," exclaims Cohen (p. xxvi), "has already begun to shake the materialism of the natural scientists, and perhaps in only a little while will defeat it completely." Idealism is permeating (<I>Durchwirkung </I>) the new physics. "Atomism must give place to dynamism. . . ." "It is a remarkable turn of affairs that research into the chemical problem of substance should have led to a fundamental triumph over the materialist view of matter. Just as Thales performed the first abstraction of the idea of substance, and linked it with speculations on the electron, so the theory of electricity was destined to cause the greatest revolution in the conception of matter and, through the transformation of matter into force, bring about the victory of idealism" (p. xxix). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Hermann Cohen is as clear and definite as James Ward in pointing out the <I>fundamental</I> philosophical trends, and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 340</B></FONT><P>

does not lose himself (as our Machians do) in petty distinctions between this and that energeticist, symbolist, empirio-criticist, empirio-monist idealism, and so forth. Cohen takes the <I>fundamental</I> philosophical trend of the school of physics that is now associated with the names of Mach, Poincar&eacute and others and correctly describes this trend as <I>idealist</I>. "The transformation of matter into force" is here for Cohen the most important triumph of idealism, just as it was for the "ghost-seeing" scientists -- whom J. Dietzgen exposed in 1869. Electricity is proclaimed a collaborator of idealism, because it has destroyed the old theory of the structure of matter, shattered the atom and discovered new forms of material motion, so unlike the old, so totally uninvestigated and unstudied, so unusual and "miraculous," that it permits nature to be presented as <I>non-material</I> (spiritual, mental, psychical) motion. Yesterday's limit to our knowledge of the infinitesimal particles of matter has disappeared, hence -- concludes the idealist philosopher -- matter has disappeared (but thought remains). Every physicist and every engineer knows that electricity is (material) motion, but nobody knows clearly <I>what</I> is moving, hence -- concludes the idealist philosopher -- we can dupe the philosophically uneducated with the seductively "economical" proposition: let us <I>conceive</I> motion <I>without matter</I>. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Hermann Cohen tries to enlist the famous physicist Heinrich Hertz as llis ally. Hertz is ours -- he is a Kantian, we sometimes find him admitting the <I>a priori</I>, he says. Hertz is ours, he is a Machian -- contends the Machian Kleinpeter -- for in Hertz we have glimpses of "the same subjectivist view of the nature of our concepts as in the case of Mach."*

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 341</B></FONT><P>

This strange dispute as to <I>where</I> Hertz belongs is a good example of how the idealist philosophers seize on the minutest error, the slightest vagueness of expression on the part of renowned scientists in order to justify their refurbished defence of fideism. As a matter of fact, Hertz's philosophical preface to his <I>Mechanik </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp341">*</A>]</FONT> displays the usual standpoint of the scientist who has been intimidated by the professorial hue and cry against the "metaphysics" of materialism, but who nevertheless cannot overcome his instinctive conviction of the reality of the external world. This has been acknowledged by Kleinpeter himself, who on the one hand casts to the mass of readers thoroughly false popularly-written pamphlets on the theory of knowledge of <I>natural science</I>, in which Mach figures side by side with Hertz, while on the other, in specifically philosophical articles, he admits that "Hertz, as opposed to Mach and Pearson, still clings to the prejudice that all physics can be explained in a mechanistic way,"** that he retains the concept of the thing-in-itself and "the usual standpoint of the physicists," and that Hertz still adheres to "a picture of the universe in itself," and so on.*** 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It is interesting to note Hertz's view of energetics. He writes: "If we inquire into the real reason why physics at the present time prefers to express itself in terms of energetics, we may answer that it is because in this way it best avoids talking about things of which it knows very little. . . . Of course, we are now convinced that ponderable matter

consists of atoms; and in certain cases we have fairly definite ideas of the magnitude of these atoms and of their motions. But the form of the atoms, their connection, their motions in most cases, all these are entirely hidden from us. . . . So that our conception of atoms is therefore in itself an important and interesting object for further investigations, but is not particularly adapted to serve as a known and secure foundation for mathematical theories" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., Vol. III, p. 21). Hertz expected that further study of the ether would provide an explanation of the "nature of traditional matter . . . its inertia and gravitational force" (Vol. I, p. 354). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is evident from this that the possibility of a non-materialist view of energy did not even occur to Hertz. Energetics served the philosophers as an excuse to desert materialism for idealism. The scientist regards energetics as a convenient method of expressing the laws of material motion at a period when, if we may so express it, physicists had left the atom but had not yet arrived at the electron. This period is to a large extent not yet at an end; one hypothesis yields place to another; nothing whatever is known of the positive electron; only three months ago (June 22, 1908), Jean Becquerel reported to the French Academy of Science that he had succeeded in discovering this "new component part of matter" (<I>Comptes rendus des s&eacuteances de l'Acad&eacutemie des Sciences</I>, p. 1311). How could idealist philosophy rcfrain from taking advantage of such an opportunity, when "matter" was still being "sought" by the human mind and was therefore no more than a "symbol," etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Another German idealist, one far more reactionary than Cohen, Eduard von Hartmann, devoted a whole book to the world outlook of modern physics (<I>Die Weltanschauung der modernen Physik</I>, Leipzig, 1902). We are, of course, not in-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 343</B></FONT><P>

terested in the specific arguments of the author in favour of his own variety of idealism. For us it is important only to point out that this idealist notes the same phenomena as Rey, Ward and Cohen. "Modern physics had grown up on a realist basis," says Hartmann, "and it was only the Neo-Kantian and agnostic movement of our own time that led it to re-interpret its data in an idealist spirit" (p. 218). According to Hartmann, three epistemological systems constitute the basis of modern physics -- hylo-kinetics (from the Greek <I>hyle</I> -- matter, and <I>kinesis</I> -- motion -- <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the recognition of physical phenomena as matter in motion), energetics, and dynamism (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the recognition of force without substance). Of course, the idealist Hartmann favours "dynamism," from which he draws the conclusion that the laws of nature are world-thought, in a word, he "substitutes" the psychical for physical nature. But he is forced to admit that hylo-kinetics has the majority of physicists on its side, that it is the system that "is most frequently employed" (p. 190), that its serious defect is "materialism and atheism, which threaten from pure hylo-kinetics" (p. 189). This author quite justly regards energetics as an intermediary system and calls it agnosticism (p. 136). Of course, it is an "ally of pure dynamism, for it dethrones substance" (pp. vi, 192), but Hartmann dislikes its agnosticism as a form of "Anglomania," which is incompatible with the genuine idealism of a true-German reactionary. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is highly instructive to see how this irreconcilable partisan idealist (non-partisans in philosophy are just as hopelessly thick-headed as they are in politics) explains to the physicists what it means to follow one epistemological trend or another. "Only a very few of the physicists who follow this fashion," writes Hartmann in reference to the idealist interpretation 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 344</B></FONT><P>

of the latest results in physics, "realise the full scope and implications of such an interpretation. They have failed to observe that physics with its specific laws has retained significance only in so far as, despite its idealism, it has adhered to <I>realistic</I> basic propositions, <I>viz</I>., the existence of things-in-themselves, their real mutability in time, real causality. . . . Only by granting these realistic premises (the transcendental validity of causality, time and three-dimensional space), <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., only on the condition that nature, of whose laws physics speaks, coincides with a . . . realm of things-in themselves, can one speak of natural laws as distinct from psychological laws. Only if natural laws operate in a realm independent of our mind can they serve as an explanation of the fact that the logically necessary effects of our images are always images of the natural-historically necessary effects of the unknown which they reflect or symbolise in our consciousness" (pp. 218-19). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Hartmann rightly feels that the idealism of the new physics is nothing but a <I>fashion</I>, and not a serious philosophical turn away from natural-historical materialism; and he, therefore, correctly explains to the physicists that in order to transform the "fashion" into consistent, integral philosophical idealism it is necessary radically to modify the doctrine of the objective reality of time, space, causality and natural law. We cannot regard only atoms, electrons and ether as mere symbols, as a mere "working hypothesis": time, space, the laws of nature and the whole external world must also be proclaimed a "working hypothesis." Either materialism, or the universal substitution of the psychical for the whole of physical nature; those anxious to confound the two are legion, but we and Bogdanov are not of their number. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 345</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Among the German physicists, Ludwig Boltzmann, who died in 1906, systematically combated the Machian tendency. We have already pointed out that as against those who were "carried away by the new epistemological dogmas" he simply and clearly reduced Machism to solipsism (see above, Chap. I, &#167; 6). Boltzmann, of course, was afraid to call himself a materialist and even explicitly stated that he did not deny the existence of God.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp345">*</A>]</FONT> But his theory of knowledge is essentially materialistic, and expresses -- as is admitted by S. G&uumlnther,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp345">**</A>]</FONT> the historian of natural science in the nineteenth century -- the views of the majority of scientists. "We know," says Boltzmann, "of the existence of all things solely from the impressions they make on our senses" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 29). Theory is an "image" (or copy) of nature, of the external world (p. 77). To those who say that matter is only a complex of sense-perceptions, Boltzmann points out that in that case other people are only the sensations of the speaker (p. 168). These "ideologues," as Boltzmann sometimes calls the philosophical idealists, present us with a "subjective picture of the world" (p. 176), whereas the author prefers a "simpler objective picture of the world." "The idealist compares the assertion that matter exists as well as our sensations with the child's opinion that a stone which is beaten experiences pain. The realist compares the assertion that one cannot conceive how the mental can be formed from the material, or even from the play of atoms, with the opinion of an uneducated person who asserts that the distance between the sun and the earth cannot be twenty million miles, for he

cannot conceive it" (p. 186). Boltzmann does not deny that the ideal of science is to present mind and volition as "complex actions of particles of matter" (p. 396). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   L. Boltzmann frequently polemicised against Ostwald's energetics from the standpoint of a physicist, and argued that Ostwald could neither disprove nor eliminate the formula of kinetic energy (half the mass multiplied by the square of velocity) and that he was revolving in a vicious circle by first deducing energy from mass (by accepting the formula of kinetic energy) and then defining mass as energy (pp. 112, 139). This reminds me of Bogdanov's paraphrase of Mach in the third book of his <I>Empirio-Monism</I>.<A NAME="p346"> "In science," writes Bogdanov in reference to Mach's <I>Mechanik</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en111">111</A>]</FONT> "the concept matter is reduced to the coefficient of mass as it appears in the equations of mechanics, upon accurate analysis, how ever, the coefficient of mass proves to be the reciprocal of the acceleration when two physical body-complexes interact" (p. 146). It is evident that if a certain <I>body</I> is taken as a unit, the motion (mechanical) of all other bodies can be expressed as a mere relation of acceleration. But this does not at all mean that "bodies" (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., matter) disappear or cease to exist independently of our mind. When the whole world is reduced to the movement of electrons, it will be possible to eliminate the electron from all equations, because it will be everywhere assumed, and the correlation between groups or aggregates of electrons will reduce itself to their mutual acceleration, if the forms of motion prove to be as simple as those of mechanics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Combating the "phenomenalist" physics of Mach and Co., Boltzmann maintained that "those who believe atomism to have been eliminated by differential equations, cannot see the wood for the trees" (p. 144). "If we do not wish to 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 347</B></FONT><P>

entertain illusions as to the significance of a differential equation . . . we cannot doubt that this picture of the world (expressed in differential equations) must again by its nature be an atomic one, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., an instruction that the changes in time of a vast quantity of things arranged in three-dimensional space must be thought of in accordance with definite rules. The things can, of course, be similar or dissimilar, unchangeable or changeable," etc. (p. 156). "If we are perfectly clear," said Boltzmann in an address delivered to the Congress of Scientists held in Munich in 1899, "that the phenomenalists cloaked in differential equations likewise base themselves on atom-like discrete units (<I>Einzelwesen </I>) which they have to picture as possessing now certain properties now others for each group of phenomena, the need for a simplified, uniform atomism will soon again be felt" (p. 223). The electron theory "is developing into an atomic theory of electricity as a whole" (p. 357). The unity of nature is revealed in the "astonishing analogy" between the differential equations of the various realms of phenomena. "The same equations can be regarded as solving the problems of hydro-dynamics and of the theory of potentials. The theory of vortices in fluids and the theory of friction in gases (<I>Gasreibung </I>) reveal a most astonishing analogy to the theory of electromagnetism, etc." (p. 7). Those who accept "the theory of universal substitution" cannot escape the question: Who was it that thought of "substituting" physical nature so uniformly? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As if in answer to those who brush aside "the physicist of the old school," Boltzmann relates in detail how certain specialists in "physical chemistry" are adopting an epistemological position contrary to that of Machism. Vaubel, the author of "one of the best" comprehensive works of 1903 (according to Boltzmann), "takes up a definitely hostile atti-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 348</B></FONT><P>

tude towards the so-called phenomenalism so often recommended today" (p. 381). "He tries rather to obtain as concrete and clear an idea as possible of the nature of atoms and molecules and of the forces and agencies acting between them, and this idea he attempts to bring into conformity with the most recent experiments in this field [ions, electrons, radium, Zeeman effect, etc.]. . . . The author strictly adheres to the dualism of matter and energy,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp348">*</A>]</FONT> which have this in common that each has a special law of conservation. In regard to matter, the author also holds fast to the dualism between ponderable matter and ether, yet regards the latter as material in the strictest sense" (p. 381). In the second volume of his work (theory of electricity) the author "from the very outset takes the view that the phenomena of electricity are determined by the interaction and movement of atom-like entities, the electrons" (p. 383). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Hence, we find that what the spiritualist James Ward admitted to be true of England applies also to Germany, namely, that the physicists of the realistic school systematise the facts and discoveries of recent years no less successfully than the physicists of the symbolist school and that the essential difference between them consists "<I>only </I>" in their epistemological points of view.**

&nbsp &nbsp 
* Boltzmann wishes to say that the author does not attempt to conceive motion without matter. To speak of dualism here is ridiculous. Philosophical monism and dualism consist respectively in a consistent or inconsistent adherence to materialism or idealism.<BR> 
&nbsp &nbsp 
** The work of Erich Becher, <I>Philosophical Premises of the Exact Sciences</I> (<I>Philosophische Votaussetzungen der exakten Naturwissenschaften</I>, Leipzig, 1907), with which I became acquainted only after my book had been completed, confirms what has been said in this paragraph. Holdin, closest of all to the epistemological point of view of Helmholtz and Boltzmann, that is, to a "shamefaced" and incompletely thought-out [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 349. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] materialism, the author devotes his work to a defence and interpretation of the fundamental premises of physics and chemistry. This defence naturally becomes converted into a fight against the fashionable but increasingly-resisted Machian trend in physics (<I>cf</I>. p. 91, etc.). E. Becher correctly characterises this tendency as "<I>subjective positivism </I>" (p. iii) and reduces the central point of his objection to it to a proof of the "hypothesis" of the external world (Chapters II-VII), to a proof of its "existence independently of human perceptions" (<I>vom Wahrgenommenawerden unabh&aumlngige Existenz </I>). The denial of this "hypothesis" by the Machians frequently leads the latter to <I>solipsism</I> (pp. 78-82, etc.). "Mach's view [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 350. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] that sensations and complexes of sensations, and not the external world" (p. 138), are the only subject matter of science, Becher calls "sensationalist monism" (<I>Empfindungsmonismus </I>) and classes it with the "purely conscientialistic tendencies." This clumsy and absurd term is constructed from the Latin word <I>conscientia</I> -- consciousness, and means nothing but philosophical idealism (<I>cf</I>. p. 156). In the last two chapters of the book E. Becher quite skilfully compares the old mechanical theory with the new electrical theory of matter and world-picture (the "kinetico-elastic," as the author puts it, with the "kinetico-electric" conception of nature). The latter theory, based on the electron theory, is a step forward in [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 351. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] knowledge of the unity of the world; according to this theory the "elements of the material world are electrical charges" (<I>Ladungen</I>, p. 223). "Every purely kinetic conception of nature knows nothing save a certain number of moving objects, whether they are called electrons or something else. The state of motion of these objects in successive time intervals is consistently determined by their position and state of motion in the preceding time interval" (p. 225). The chief defect of Becher's book is his absolute ignorance of dialectical materialism. This ignorance frequently leads him into confusion and absurdity, on which it is impossible to dwell here.

                               6.&nbsp;THE TWO TRENDS IN MODERN PHYSICS<BR>
                                             AND FRENCH FIDEISM
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In France, idealist philosophy has seized upon the vacillations of Machian physics with no less determination. We have already seen how the neo-criticists greeted Mach's <I>Mechanik</I> and how they immediately discerned the idealist character of the principles of Mach's philosophy. The French Machian, Henri Poincar&eacute, was even more successful in this respect. The most reactionary idealist philosophy, the implications of which were definitely fideistic, immediately seized upon his theory. An adherent of this philosophy, Le Roy, argued thus: the truths of science are conventional signs, symbols; you have abandoned the absurd, "metaphysical" claims to knowledge of objective reality -- well then, be logical and agree with us that science has practical significance only for one sphere of human activity and that religion has <I>a no less real significance</I> for another sphere of activity; "symbolic," Machian science has no right to deny theology. H. Poincar&eacute was abashed by these conclusions and in his book <I>La valeur de la science</I> made a special attack on them. But just see <I>what</I> epistemological position he was obliged to adopt in order to rid himself of allies of the type of Le Roy. He 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 350</B></FONT><P>

writes: "M. Le Roy regards the intellect as incurably impotent only in order to give greater place to other sources of knowledge, for instance, the heart, sentiment, instinct and faith" (pp. 214-15). "I do not go to the limit," he says. Scientific laws are conventions, symbols, but "if scientific 'recipes' have a value as rules of action, it is because we know that, in general at least, they are successful. But to know this is already to know something; and if so, how can you say that we can know nothing?" (p. 219). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   H. Poincar&eacute resorts to the criterion of practice. But he only shifts the question without settling it; for this criterion may be interpreted in a subjective as well as in an objective way. Le Roy also admits this criterion for science and industry; all he denies is that this criterion proves <I>objective</I> truth, for such a denial suffices him for admitting the subjective truth of religion along with the subjective truth of science (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., as not existing apart from mankind). Poincar&eacute realises that one cannot limit oneself to a reference to practice in arguing against Le Roy, and he passes to the question of the objectivity of science. "What is the criterion of its objectivity? Well, it is exactly the same as the criterion of our belief in external objects. These objects are real in as much as the sensations they evoke in us (<I>qu'ils nous font</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 351</B></FONT><P>

<I>&eacuteprouver </I>) appear to be united by some sort of indestructible cement and not by an ephemeral accident" (pp. 269-70). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The author of such a remark may well be a great <I>physicist</I>, but it is absolutely indisputable that only the Voroshilov-Yushkeviches can take him seriously as a philosopher. Materialism is declared to have been destroyed by a "theory" which at the first onslaught of fideism <I>takes refuge under the wing of materialism </I>! For it is the purest materialism to say that sensations are evoked in us by real objects and that "belief" in the objectivity of science is the same as "belief" in the objective existence of external objects. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . It can be said, for instance, that ether has no less reality than any external body" (p. 270). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What an outcry our Machians would have raised had a materialist said that! How many feeble witticisms would have been uttered at the expense of "ethereal materialism," and so forth. But five pages later the founder of recent empirio-symbolism declares: "Everything that is not thought is pure nothing, since we can think nothing but thought" (p. 276). You are mistaken, M. Poincar&eacute; your works prove that there are people who can only think what is entirely devoid of thought. To this class of people belongs the notorious muddler, Georges Sorel, who maintains that the "first 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 352</B></FONT><P>

two parts" of Poincar&eacute's book on the value of science are written in the "spirit of Le Roy" and that therefore the two philosophers can be "reconciled" as follows: the attempt to establish an identity between science and the world is an illusion; there is no need to raise the question whether science can have knowledge of nature or not, for it is sufficient that science should correspond with the mechanisms created by us (Georges Sorel, <I>Les pr&eacuteoccupations metaphysiques des physiciens modernes</I> [<I>Metaphysical Preoccupations of the Modern Physicists </I>], Paris, 1907, pp. 77, 80, 81). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But while it is sufficient merely to mention the "philosophy" of Poincar&eacute and pass on, it is imperative to dwell at some length on the work of A. Rey. We have already pointed out that the two basic trends in modern physics, which Rey calls the "conceptualist" and the "neo-mechanistic," reduce themselves to the difference between the idealist and the materialist epistemologies. We must now see how the positivist Rey solves a problem which is diametrically opposed to that broached by the spiritualist James Ward and the idealists Cohen and Hartmann, the problem, namely, not of seizing upon the philosophical mistakes of the new physics, its leanings towards idealism, but of rectifying these mistakes and of proving the illegitimacy of the idealist (and fideist) conclusions drawn from the new physics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A thread that runs through the whole of Rey's work is the recognition of the fact that the new physical theory of the "conceptualists" (Machians) has been seized upon by <I>fideism</I> (pp. 11, 17, 220, 362, etc.) and "<I>philosophical idealism </I>" (p. 200), scepticism as to the rights of the intellect and the rights of science (pp. 210, 220), subjectivism (p. 311), and so forth. Therefore, Rey quite rightly makes the analysis 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 253</B></FONT><P>

of the "opinions of the physicists on the objective validity of physics" (p. 3) the <I>centre</I> of his work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And what are the results of this analysis? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us take the basic concept, the concept of experience. Rey assures us that Mach's subjectivist interpretation (for the sake of simplicity and brevity we shall take Mach as the representative of the school which Rey terms conceptualist) is a sheer misunderstanding. It is true that one of the "outstanding new features of the philosophy of the end of the nineteenth century" is that "empiricism, becoming ever subtler and richer in nuances, leads to fideism, to the supremacy of faith -- this same empiricism that was once the great war engine of scepticism against the assertions of metaphysics. Has not at bottom the real meaning of the word 'experience' been distorted, little by little, by imperceptible nuances? Experience, when returned to the conditions of existence, to that experimental science which renders it exact and refined, leads us to necessity and to truth" (p. 398). There is no doubt that all Machism, in the broad sense of the term, is nothing but a distortion, by means of imperceptible nuances, of the real meaning of the word "experience"! But how does Rey, who accuses only the fideists of distortion, but not Mach himself, correct this distortion? Listen. "Experience is by definition a knowledge of the object. In physical science this definition is more in place than anywhere else. . . . Experience is that over which our mind has no command, that which our desires, our volition, cannot control, that which is given and which is not of our own making. Experience is the object that faces (<I>en face du </I>) the subject" (p. 314). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here you have an example of how Rey defends Machism! What penetrating genius Engels revealed when he 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 354</B></FONT><P>

dubbed the latest type of adherents of philosophical agnosticism and phenomenalism "shamefaced materialists." The positivist and ardent phenomenalist, Rey, is a superb specimen of this type. If experience is "knowledge of the object," if "experience is the object that faces the subject," if experience means that "something external (<I>quelque chose du de hors </I>) exists and necessarily exists" (<I>se pose et en se posant s'impose</I> -- p. 324), this obviously amounts to materialism! Rey's phenomenalism, his ardent and emphatic assertion that nothing exists save sensations, that the objective is that which is generally valid, etc., etc. -- all this is only a fig-leaf, an empty verbal covering for materialism, since we are told: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The objective is that which is given from without, that which is imposed (<I>impos&eacute </I>) by experience; it is that which is not of our making, but which is made independently of us and which to a certain extent makes us" (p. 320). Rey defends "conceptualism" by destroying conceptualism! The refutation of the idealist implications of Machism is achieved only by interpreting Machism after the manner of shame faced materialism. Having himself admitted the distinction between the two trends in modern physics, Rey toils in the sweat of his brow to obliterate all distinctions in the interests of the materialist trend. Rey says of the neo-mechanist school, for instance, that it does not admit the "least doubt, the least uncertainty" as to the objectivity of physics (p. 237): "Here [in regard to the doctrines of this school] one feels remote from the detours one was obliged to make from the standpoint of the other theories of physics in order to arrive at the assertion of this objectivity." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But it is such "detours" of Machism that Rey conceals by casting a veil over them in his exposition. The fundamental characteristic of materialism is that it <I>starts from</I> the objec-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 355</B></FONT><P>

tivity of science, from the recognition of objective reality reflected by science, whereas idealism <I>needs</I> "detours" in order, in one way or another, to "deduce" objectivity from mind, consciousness, the "psychic." "The neo-mechanist [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the prevailing] school in physics," says Rey, "<I>believes in the reality</I> of the physical theory just as humanity <I>believes in the reality</I> of the external world" (p. 234, &#167; 22: Thesis). For this school "theory aims at being a copy (<I>le d&eacutecalque </I>) of the object" (p. 235). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   True. And this fundamental trait of the "neo-mechanist" school is nothing but the basis of <I>materialist</I> epistemology. No attempts of Rey to dissociate himself from the materialists or to assure us that the neo-mechanists are also in essence phenomenalists, etc., can mitigate this basic fact. The essence of the difference between the neo-mechanists (materialists who are more or less shamefaced) and the Machians is that the latter <I>depart</I> from this theory of knowledge, and departing from it inevitably <I>fall</I> into fideism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take Rey's attitude to Mach's theory of causality and necessity in nature. Only at first glance, Rey assures us, does it appear that Mach is "approaching scepticism" and "subjectivism" (p. 76); this "ambiguity" (<I>&eacutequivoque</I>, p. 115) disappears if Mach's teaching is taken as a whole. And Rey takes it as a whole,<A NAME="p355"> quotes a series of passages from the <I>W&aumlrmelehre </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en112">112</A>]</FONT> and the <I>Analyse der Empfindungen</I>, and specially deals with the chapter on causality in the former book, but . . . <I>he takes care not to quote the decisive passage</I>, <I>Mach's declaration that there is no physical necessity</I>, <I>but only logical necessity </I>! All that one can say of such a procedure is that it does not interpret Mach but adorns him, that it obliterates the differences between "neo-mechanism" and Machism. Rey's conclusion is that "Mach adopts the analysis 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 356</B></FONT><P>

and conclusions of Hume, Mill and all the phenomenalists, according to whom the causal relation has no <I>substantiality</I> and is only a habit of thought. He has also adopted the fundamental thesis of phenomenalism, of which the doctrine of causality is only a consequence, namely, that nothing exists save sensations. But he adds, along a purely objectivist line, that science, analysing sensations, discovers in them certain permanent and common elements which, although abstracted from these sensations, have the same reality as the sensations themselves, for they are taken from sensations by means of perceptual observation. And these permanent and common elements, such as energy and its various forms, are the foundation for the systematisation of physics" (p. 117). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This means that Mach accepts Hume's subjective theory of causality and interprets it in an objectivist sense! Rey is shirking the issue when he defends Mach by referring to his inconsistency, and by maintaining that in the "real" interpretation of experience the latter leads to "necessity." Now, experience is what is given to us from without; and if the necessity of nature and its laws are also given to man from without, from an objectively real nature, then, of course, all difference between Machism and materialism vanishes. Rey defends Machism against the charge of "neo-mechanism" by capitulating to the latter all along the line, retaining the word phenomenalism but not the essence of that trend. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Poincar&eacute, for instance, fully in the spirit of Mach, derives the laws of nature -- including even the tri-dimensionality of space -- from "convenience." But this does not at all mean "arbitrary," Rey hastens to "correct." Oh no, "convenient" here expresses "<I>adaptation to the object </I>" (Rey's italics, p. 196). What a superb differentiation between the two schools and what a superb "refutation" of materialism! "If Poin-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 357</B></FONT><P>

car&eacute's theory is logically separated by an impassable gulf from the ontological interpretation of the mechanist school [<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., from the latter's acceptance of theory as a copy of the object] . . . if Poincar&eacute's theory lends itself to the support of philosophical idealism, in the scientihc sphere, at least, it agrees very well with the general evolution of the ideas of classical physics and the tendency to regard physics as objective knowledge, as objective as experience, that is, as the sensations from which experience proceeds" (p. 200). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   On the one hand, we cannot but admit; on the other hand, it must be confessed. On the one hand, an impassable gulf divides Poincar&eacute from neo-mechanism, although Poincar&eacute stands <I>in between</I> Mach's "conceptualism" and neo-mechanism, while Mach, it would appear, is not separated by any gulf from neo-mechanism; on the other hand, Poincar&eacute is quite compatible with classical physics which, according to Rey himself, completely accepts the standpoint of "mechanism." On the one hand, Poincar&eacute's theory lends itself to the support of philosophical idealism; on the other hand, it is compatible with the objective interpretation of the word experience. On the one hand, these bad fideists have distorted the meaning of the word experience by imperceptible deviations, by departing from the correct view that "experience is the object"; on the other hand, the objectivity of experience means only that experience is sensation . . . with which both Berkeley and Fichte agree! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Rey got himself muddled because he had set himself the impossible task of "reconciling" the opposition between the materialist and the idealist schools in the new physics. He seeks to tone down the materialism of the neo-mechanist school, attributing to phenomenalism the views of physicists  

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 358</B></FONT><P>

who regard their theory as a copy of the object.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp358">*</A>]</FONT> And he seeks to tone down the idealism of the conceptualist school by pruning away the more emphatic declarations of its adherents and interpreting the rest in the spirit of shamefaced materialism. How far-fetched and fictitious is Rey's disavowal of materialism is shown, for example, by his opinion of the theoretical significance of the differential equations of Maxwell and Hertz. In the opinion of the Machians, the fact that these physicists limit their theory to a system of equations refutes materialism: there are equations and nothing else -- no matter, no objective reality, only symbols. Boltzmann refutes this view, fully aware that he is refuting phenomenalist physics. Rey refutes this view thinking he is defending phenomenalism! He says: "We could not refuse to class Maxwell and Hertz among the 'mechanists' because they limited themselves to equations similar to the differential equations of Lagrange's dynamics. This does not mean that in the opinion of Maxwell and Hertz we shall be unable to build a mechanical theory of electricity out of real elements. Quite the contrary, the fact that we represent electrical phenomena in a theory the form of which is identical with the general form of classical mechanics is proof of the possibility . . . " (p. 253). The indefiniteness of the present

&nbsp &nbsp 
* The "conciliator," A. Rey, not only cast a veil over the formulation of the question at issue as made by philosophical materialism but also ignored the most clearly expressed materialistic declarations of the French physicists. He did not mention, for example, Alfred Cornu, who died in 1902. That physicist met the Ostwaldian "destruction [or conquest, <I>Ueberwindung </I>] of scientific materialism" with a contemptuous remark regarding pretentious journalistic treatment of the question (see <I>Revue g&eacuten&eacuterele des sciences</I>, 1895, pp. 1030-31). At the international congress of physicists held in Paris in 1900, Cornu said: " . . . The deeper we [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 359. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] penetrate into the knowledge of natural phenomena, the more does the bold Cartesian conception of the mechanism of the universe unfold and define itself, namely, that in the physical world there is nothing save matter and motion. The problem of the unity of physical forces . . . has again come to the fore after the great discoveries which marked the end of this century. Also the constant concern of our modern leaders, Faraday, Maxwell, Hertz (to mention only the illustrious dead), was to define nature more accurately and to unravel the properties of this elusive matter (<I>mati&egravere subtile </I>), the receptacle of world energy. . . . The rever- [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 360. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] sion to Cartesian ideas is obvious. . . ." (Rapports pr&eacutesent&eacutes au congr&egraves international de physique [<I>Reports Made at the International Physics Congress </I>], Paris, 1900, t. 4-me, p. 7.) Lucien Poincar&eacute, in his book <I>Modern Physics</I>, justly remarks that this Cartesian idea was taken up and developed by the Encyclopaedists of the eighteenth century (<I>La physique moderne</I>, Paris, 1906, p. 14). But neither this physicist nor A. Cornu knew that the dialectical materialists Marx and Engels had freed this fundamental premise of materialism from the one-sidedness of mechanistic materialism.

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 359</B></FONT><P>

solution of the problem "will diminish in proportion as the <I>nature</I> of the quantities, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., elements, that figure in the equations are more precisely determined." The fact that one or another form of material motion has not yet been investigated is not regarded by Rey as a reason for denying the materiality of motion. "The homogeneity of matter" (p. 262), not as a postulate, but as a result of experience and of the development of science, "the homogeneity of the object of physics" -- this is the condition that makes the application of measurement and mathematical calculations possible.

   Here is Rey's estimate of the criterion of practice in the theory of knowledge: "Contrary to the propositions of scepticism, it seems legitimate to say that the practical value of science is derived from its theoretical value" (p. 368). Rey prefers not to speak of the fact that these propositions of scepticism are unequivocally accepted by Mach, Poincar&eacute and their entire school. "They [the practical value and theoretical value of science] are the two inseparable and strictly parallel aspects of its objective value. To say that a law of nature has practical value . . . is fundamentally the same as saying that this law of nature has objectivity. To act on the object implies to modify the object; it implies a reaction on the part of the object that conforms to the expectation or anticipation contained in the proposition in virtue of which 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 360</B></FONT><P>

we acted on the object. Hence, this expectation or anticipation contains elements <I>controlled</I> by the object and by the action it undergoes. . . . In these diverse theories there is thus a part of objectivity" (p. 368). This is a thoroughly materialist, and only materialist, theory of knowledge, for other points of view, and Machism in particular, deny that the criterion of practice has objective significance, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., significance that does not depend upon man and mankind. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To sum up, Rey approached the question from an angle entirely different from that of Ward, Cohen, and Co., but he arrived at the same result, namely, the recognition that the materialist and idealist trends form the basis of the division between the two principal schools in modern physics.

                                  7.&nbsp;A RUSSIAN "IDEALIST PHYSICIST"
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Owing to certain unfortunate conditions under which I am obliged to work, I have been almost entirely unable to acquaint myself with the Russian literature of the subject under discussion. I shall confine myself to an exposition of an article that has an important bearing on my theme written by our notorious arch-reactionary philosopher, Mr. Lopatin. The article appeared in the September-October 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 361</B></FONT><P>
<A NAME="p361">
issue of <I>Problems of Philosophy and Psychology</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en113">113</A>]</FONT> I907, and is entitled "An Idea!ist Physicist." A "true-Russian" philosophical idealist, Mr. Lopatin bears the same relation to the contemporary European idealists as, for example, the "Union of the Russian People" does to the reactionary parties of the West. All the more instructive is it, therefore, to see how similar philosophical trends manifest themselves in totally different cultural and social surroundings. Mr. Lopatin's article is, as the French say, an <I>&eacuteloge</I> -- a eulogy --  of the Russian physicist, the late N. I. Shishkin (died 1906). Mr. Lopatin was fascinated by the fact that this cultured man, who was much interested in Hertz and the new physics generally, was not only a Right-Wing Constitutional Democrat (p. 339) but a deeply religious man, a devotee of the philosophy of Vladimir Solovyov, and so on and so forth. However, in spite of the fact that his main line of "endeavour" lies in the borderland between philosophy and the police department, Mr. Lopatin has also furnished certain material for a characterisation of the <I>epistemological</I> views of this idealist physicist. Mr. Lopatin writes: "He was a genuine positivist in his tireless endeavour to give the broadest possible criticism of the methods of investigation, suppositions and facts of science from the standpoint of their suitability as means and material for the construction of an integral and perfected world outlook. In this respect N. I. Shishkin was the very antipode of many of his contemporaries. In previous articles of mine in this periodical, I have frequently endeavoured to explain the heterogeneous and often shaky materials from which the so-called scientific world outlook is made up. They include established facts, more or less bold generalisations, hypotheses that are convenient at the given moment for one or another field of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 362</B></FONT><P>

science, and even auxiliary scientific fictions. And all this is elevated to the dignity of incontrovertible objective truths, from the standpoint of which all other ideas and all other beliefs of a philosophical and religious nature must be judged, and everything in them that is not indicated in these truths must be rejected. Our highly talented natural scientist and thinker, Professor V. I. Vernadsky, has shown with exemplary clarity how shallow and unfounded are these claims to convert the scientific views of a given historical period into an immobile, dogmatic system obligatory for all. And it is not only the broad reading public that is guilty of making such a conversion [<I>footnote by Mr. Lopatin </I>: "For the broad public a number of popular books have been written, the purpose of which is to foster the conviction that there exists such a scientific catechism providing an answer to all questions. Typical works of this kind are B&uumlchner's <I>Force and Matter</I> and Haeckel's <I>The Riddle of the Universe</I>"] and not only individual scientists in particular branches of science; what is even more strange is that this sin is frequently committed by the official philosophers, all of whose efforts are at times directed only to proving that they are saying nothing but what has been said before them by representatives of the several sciences, and that they are only saying it in their own language. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "N. I. Shishkin had no trace of prejudiced dogmatism. He was a convinced champion of the mechanical explanation of the phenomena of nature, but for him it was only a method of investigation . . ." (p. 341). So, so . . . a familiar refrain! "He was far from believing that the mechanical theory reveals the true nature of the phenomena investigated; he regarded it only as the most convenient and fertile method of unifying and explaining them for the purposes 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 363</B></FONT><P>

of science. For him, therefore, the mechanical conception of nature and the materialist view of nature by no means coincide." Exactly as in the case of the authors of the <I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism </I>! "Quite the contrary, it seemed to him that in questions of a higher order, the mechanical theory ought to take a very critical, even a conciliatory attitude." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the language of the Machians this is called "overcoming the obsolete, narrow and one-sided" opposition between materialism and idealism. "Questions of the first beginning and ultimate end of things, of the inner nature of our mind, of freedom of the will, the immortality of the soul and so forth, cannot in their full breadth of meaning come within its scope -- since as a method of investigation it is confined within the natural limits of its applicability solely to the facts of physical experience" (p. 342). The last two lines are an undoubted plagiarism from A. Bogdanov's <I>Empirio-momsm.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Light can be regarded" -- wrote Shishkin in his article "Psycho-Physical Phenomena from the Standpoint of the Mechanical Theory" (<I>Problems of Philosophy and Psychology</I>, Bk. 1, p. 127) -- "as substance, as motion, as electricity, as sensation." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is no doubt that Mr. Lopatin is absolutely right in ranking Shishkin among the positivists and that this physicist belonged body and soul to the Machian school of the new physics. In his statement on light, Shishkin means to say that the various methods of regarding light are various methods of "organising experience" (in A. Bogdanov's terminology), all equally legitimate from different points of view, or that they are various "connections of elements" (in Mach's terminology), and that, in any case, the physicists' 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 364</B></FONT><P>

theory of light is not a copy of objective reality. But Shishkin argues very badly. "Light can be regarded as substance, as motion. . ." he says. But in nature there is neither substance without motion nor motion without substance. Shishkin's first "apposition" is meaningless. . . . "As electricity. . . ." Electricity is a movement of substance, hence Shishkin is wrong here too. The electromagnetic theory of light has shown that light and electricity are forms of motion of one and the same substance (ether). "As sensation. . . ." Sensation is an image of matter in motion. Save through sensations, we can know nothing either of the forms of substance or of the forms of motion; sensations are evoked by the action of matter in motion upon our sense-organs. That is how science views it. The sensation of red reflects ether vibrations of a frequency of approximately 450 trillions per second. The sensation of blue reflects ether vibrations of a frequency of approximately 620 trillions per second. The vibrations of the ether exist independently of our sensations of light. Our sensations of light depend on the action of the vibrations of the ether on the human organ of vision. Our sensations reflect objective reality, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., some thing that exists independently of humanity and of human sensations. That is how science views it. Shishkin's argument against materialism is the cheapest kind of sophistry.

                                         OF "PHYSICAL" IDEALISM
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  We have seen that the question of the epistemological deductions that can be drawn from the new physics has been raised and is being discussed from the most varied 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 365</B></FONT><P>

points of view in English, German and French literature. There can be no doubt that we have before us a certain international ideological current, which is not dependent upon any one philosophical system, but which is the result of certain general causes Iying outside the sphere of philosophy. The foregoing review of the facts undoubtedly shows that Machism is "connected" with the new physics, but at the same time reveals that the version of this connection spread by our Machians is <I>fundamentally incorrect</I>. As in philosophy, so in physics, our Machians slavishly follow the <I>fashion</I>, and are unable from their own, Marxist, standpoint to give a general survey of particular currents and to judge the place they occupy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A double falsity pervades all the talk about Mach's philosophy being "the philosophy of twentieth-century natural science," "the recent philosophy of the sciences," "recent natural-scientific positivism" and so forth. (Bogdanov in the introduction to <I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, pp. iv, xii; <I>cf</I>. also Yushkevich, Valentinov and Co.) Firstly, Machism is ideologically connected with only <I>one</I> school in <I>one</I> branch of modern science. Secondly, and this is the main point, what in Machism is connected with this school <I>is not what distinguishes it from all other trends and systems of idealist philosophy</I>, <I>but what it has in common with philosophical idealism in general</I>. It suffices to cast a glance at the ideological current in question <I>as a whole</I> in order to leave no shadow of doubt as to the truth of this statement. Take the physicists of this school: the German Mach, the Frenchman Henri Poincar&eacute, the Belgian P. Duhem, the Englishman Karl Pearson. They have much in common: they have the same basis and are following the same direction, as each of them rightly acknowledges. But what they have in com-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 366</B></FONT><P>

mon includes neither the doctrine of empirio-criticism in general, nor Mach's doctrine, say, of the "world-elements" in particular. The three latter physicists even know nothing of either of these doctrines. They have "only" one thing in common -- philosophical idealism, towards which they all, without exception, <I>tend</I> more or less consciously, more or less decisively. Take the philosophers who base themselves on <I>this school</I> of the new physics, who try to ground it epistemologically and to develop it, and you will again find the German immanentists, the disciples of Mach, the French neo-criticists and idealists, the English spiritualists, the Russian Lopatin and, in addition, the one and only empirio-monist, A. Bogdanov. They all have only one thing in common, namely, that they all -- more or less consciously, more or less decisively, either with an abrupt and precipitate slant towards fideism, or with a personal aversion to it (as in Bogdanov's case) -- are vehicles of philosophical idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The fundamental idea of the school of the new physics under discussion is the denial of the objective reality given us in our sensation and reflected in our theories, of the doubt as to the existence of such a reality. Here this school departs from <I>materialism</I> (inaccurately called realism, neo-mechanism, hylo-kinetism, and not in any appreciable degree consciously developed by the physicists), which by <I>general acknowledgment</I> prevails among the physicists -- and departs from it as a school of "physical" idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To explain this last term, which sounds very strange, it is necessary to recall an episode in the history of modern philosophy and modern science. In 1866 L. Feuerbach attacked Johannes M&uumlller, the famous founder of modern physiology, and ranked him with the "physiological idealists" (<I>Werke</I>, Vol. X, p. 197). The idealism of this physiolog-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 367</B></FONT><P>

ist consisted in the fact that when investigating the significance of the mechanism of our sense-organs in relation to sensations, showing, for instance, that the sensation of light is produced as the result of the action of various stimuli on the eye, he was inclined to arrive from this at a denial that our sensations are images of objective reality. This tendency of one school of scientists towards "physiological idealism," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., towards an idealist interpretation of certain data of physiology, was very accurately discerned by L. Feuerbach. The "connection" between physiology and philosophical idealism, chiefly of the Kantian kind, was for a long time after that exploited by reactionary philosophy. F. A. Lange made great play of physiology in support of Kantian idealism and in refutation of materialism; while among the immanentists (whom Bogdanov so incorrectly places midway between Mach and Kant), J. Rehmke in 1882 specially campaigned against the allegation that Kantianism was con firmed by physiology.* That a number of eminent physiologists at that time <I>gravitated</I> towards idealism and Kantianism is as indisputable as that today a number of eminent physicists <I>gravitate</I> towards philosophical idealism. "Physical" idealism, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the idealism of a certain school of physicists at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, no more "refutes" materialism, no more establishes the connection between idealism (or empirio-criticism) and natural science, than did the similar efforts of F. A. Lange and the "physiological" idealists. The deviation towards reactionary philosophy mani fested in both cases by one school of scientists in one branch

of science is a temporary deflection, a transitory period of sickness in the history of science, an ailment of growth, mainly brought on by the <I>abrupt breakdown</I> of old established concepts. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The connection between modern "physical" idealism and the crisis of modern physics is, as we have already pointed out, generally acknowledged. "The arguments of sceptical criticism levelled against modern physics" -- writes A. Rey, who is referring not so much to the sceptics as to the outspoken adherents of fideism, like Brunetiere -- "essentially amount to the proverbial argument of all sceptics: a diversity of opinions" (among the physicists). But this diversity "proves nothing against the objectivity of physics." "In the history of physics, as in history generally, one can distinguish great periods which differ by the form and general aspect of theories. . . . But as soon as a discovery is made that affects all fields of physics because it establishes some cardinal fact hitherto badly or very partially perceived, the entire aspect of physics is modified; a new period sets in. This is what occurred after Newton's discoveries, and after the discoveries of Joule-Mayer and Carnot-Clausius. The same thing, apparently, is taking place since the discovery of radioactivity. . . . The historian who later sees things from the necessary distance has no trouble in discerning a steady evolution where contemporaries saw conflicts, contradictions, and divisions into various schools. Apparently, the crisis which physics has undergone in recent years (despite the conclusions drawn from it by philosophical criticism) is no different. It even excellently illustrates the typical crisis of growth (<I>crise de croissance </I>) occasioned by the great modern discoveries. The undeniable transformation of physics which will result (could there be evolution or 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 369</B></FONT><P>

progress without it?) will not perceptibly alter the scientific spirit" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., pp. 370-72). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Rey the conciliator tries to unite all schools of modern physics against fideisml This is a falsity, well meant, but a falsity nevertheless; for the trend of the school of Mach-Poincar&eacute-Pearson towards idealism (<I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., refined fideism) is beyond dispute. And the objectivity of physics that is associated with the basis of the "scientific spirit," as distinct from the fideist spirit, and that Rey defends so ardently, is nothing but a "shamefaced" formulation of materialism. The basic materialist spirit of physics, as of all modern science, will overcome all crises, but only by the indispensable replacement of metaphysical materialism by dialectical materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Rey the conciliator very often tries to gloss over the fact that the crisis in modern physics consists in the latter's deviation from a direct, resolute and irrevocable recognition of the objective value of its theories. But facts are stronger than all attempts at reconciliation. The mathematicians, writes Rey, "in dealing with a science, the subject matter of which, apparently at least, is created by the mind of the scientist, and in which, at any rate, concrete phenomena are not involved in the investigation, have formed too abstract a conception of the science of physics. Attempts have been made to bring it ever closer to mathematics, and the general conception of mathematics has been transferred to the conception of physics. . . . This is an invasion of the mathematical spirit into the methods of judging and understanding physics that is denounced by all the experimenters. And is it not to this influence, none the less powerful because at times concealed, that are often due the uncertainty, the wavering of mind regarding the objectivity of physics, and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 370</B></FONT><P>

the detours made or the obstacles surmounted in order to demonstrate it? . . ." (p. 227). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is excellently said. "Wavering of mind" as to the objectivity of physics -- this is the very essence of fashionable "physical" idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . The abstract fictions of mathematics seem to have interposed a screen between physical reality and the manner in which the mathematicians understand the science of this reality. They vaguely feel the objectivity of physics. . . . Although they desire above all to be objective when they engage in physics; although they seek to find and retain a foothold in reality, they are still haunted by old habits. So that even in the concepts of energetics, which had to be built more solidly and with fewer hypotheses than the old mechanism -- which sought to copy (<I>d&eacutecalquer </I>) the sensible universe and not to reconstruct it -- we are still dealing with the theories of the mathematicians. . . . They [the mathematicians] have done everything to save objectivity, for they are aware that without objectivity there can be no physics. . . . But the complexity or deviousness of their theories nevertheless leaves an uneasy feeling. It is too artificial, too far-fetched, too stilted (<I>&eacutedifi&eacute </I>); the experimenter here does not feel the spontaneous confidence which constant contact with physical reality gives him. . . . This in effect is what is said by all physicists who are primarily physicists or who are exclusively physicists -- and their name is legion; this is what is said by the entire neo-mechanist school. . . . The crisis in physics lies in the conquest of the realm of physics by the mathematical spirit. The progress of physics on the one hand, and the progress of mathematics on the other, led in the nineteenth century to a close amalgamation between these two sciences. . . . Theoretical 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 371</B></FONT><P>

physics has become mathematical physics. . . . Then there began the formal period, that is to say, the period of mathematical physics, purely mathematical; mathematical physics not as a branch of physics so to speak, but as a branch of mathematics cultivated by the mathematicians. Along this new line the mathematician, accustomed to conceptual (purely logical) elements, which furnish the sole subject matter of his work, and feeling himself cramped by crude, material elements, which he found insufficiently pliable, necessarily always tended to reduce them to abstractions as far as possible, to present them in an entirely non-material and conceptual manner, or even to ignore them altogether. The elements, as real, objective data, as <I>physical</I> elements, so to speak, completely disappeared. There remained only formal relations represented by the differential equations. . . . If the mathematician is not the dupe of his constructive work, when he analyses theoretical physics . . . he can recover its ties with experience and its objective value, but at a first glance, and to the uninitiated person, we seem faced with an arbitrary development. . . . The concept, the notion, has everywhere replaced the real element. . . . Thus, historically, by virtue of the mathematical form assumed by theoretical physics, is explained . . . the ailment (<I>le malaise </I>), the crisis of physics, and its apparent withdrawal from objective facts" (pp. 228-32). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such is the first cause of "physical" idealism. The reactionary attempts are engendered by the very progress of science. The great successes achieved by natural science, the approach to elements of matter so homogeneous and simple that their laws of motion can be treated mathematically, encouraged the mathematicians to overlook matter. "Matter disappears," only equations remain. In the new stage of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 372</B></FONT><P>

development and apparently in a new manner, we get the old Kantian idea: reason prescribes laws to nature. Hermann Cohen, who, as we have seen, rejoices over the idealist spirit of the new physics, goes so far as to advocate the introduction of higher mathematics in the schools -- in order to imbue high-school students with the spirit of idealism, which is being extinguished in our materialistic age (F. A. Lange, <I>Geschichte des Materialismus</I>, 5. Auflage, 1896, Bd. II, S. xlix). This, of course, is the ridiculous dream of a reactionary and, in fact, there is and can be nothing here but a temporary infatuation with idealism on the part of a small number of specialists. But what is highly characteristic is the way the drowning man clutches at a straw, the subtle means whereby representatives of the educated bourgeoisie artificially attempt to preserve, or to find a place for, the fideism which is engendered among the masses of the people by their ignorance and their downtrodden condition, and by the wild absurdities of capitalist contradictions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Another cause which bred "physical" idealism is the principle of <I>relativism</I>, the relativity of our knowledge, a principle which, in a period of breakdown of the old theories, is taking a firm hold upon the physicists, and which, <I>if the latter are ignorant of dialectics</I>, is bound to lead to idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The question of the relation between relativism and dialectics plays perhaps the most important part in explaining the theoretical misadventures of Machism. Take Rey, for instance, who like all European positivists has no conception whatever of Marxist dialectics. He employs the word dialectics exclusively in the sense of idealist philosophical speculation. As a result, although he feels that the new physics has gone astray on the question of relativism, he nevertheless flounders helplessly and attempts to differentiate 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 373</B></FONT><P>

between moderate and immoderate relativism. Of course, "immoderate relativism logically, if not in practice, borders on actual scepticism" (p. 215), but there is no "immoderate" relativism, you see, in Poincar&eacute. Just fancy, one can, like an apothecary, weigh out a little more or a little less relativism and thus save Machism! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As a matter of fact, the only theoretically correct formulation of the question of relativism is given in the dialectical materialism of Marx and Engels, and ignorance of it is bound to lead from relativism to philosophical idealism. Incidentally, the failure to understand this fact is enough to render Mr. Berman's absurd book, <I>Dialectics in the Light of the Modern Theory of Knowledge</I>, utterly valueless. Mr. Berman repeats the old, old nonsense about dialectics, which he has entirely failed to understand. We have already seen that in the theory of knowledge <I>all</I> the Machians, <I>at every step</I>, reveal a similar lack of understanding. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All the old truths of physics, including those which were regarded as firmly established and incontestable, have proven to be relative truths -- <I>hence</I>, there can be no objective truth independent of mankind. Such is the argument not only of all the Machians, but of the "physical" idealists in general. That absolute truth results from the sum-total of relative truths in the course of their development; that relative truths represent relatively faithful reflections of an object existing independently of man; that these reflections become more and more faithful; that every scientific truth, notwithstanding its relative nature, contains an element of absolute truth -- all these propositions, which are obvious to anyone who has thought over Engels' <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, are for the "modern" theory of knowledge a book with seven seals. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 374</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Such works as Duhem's <I>Theory of Physics</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp374">*</A>]</FONT> or Stallo's,** which Mach particularly recommends, show very clearly that these "physical" idealists attach the most significance to the proof of the relativity of our knowledge, and that they are in reality vacillating between idealism and dialectical materialism. Both authors, who belong to different periods, and who approach the question from different angles (Duhem's speciality is physics, in which field he has worked for twenty years; Stallo was an erstwhile orthodox Hegelian who grew ashamed of his own book on natural philosophy, written in 1848 in the old Hegelian spirit), energetically combat the atomistic-mechanical conception of nature. They point to the narrowness of this conception, to the impossibility of accepting it as the limit of our knowledge, to the petrification of many of the ideas of writers who hold this conception. And it is indeed undeniable that the <I>old</I> materialism did suffer from such a defect; Engels reproached the earlier materialists for their failure to appreciate the relativity of all scientific theories, for their ignorance of dialectics and for their exaggeration of the mechanical point of view. But Engels (unlike Stallo) was able to discard Hegelian idealism and <I>to grasp</I> the great and true kernel of Hegelian dialectics. Engels rejected the old metaphysical materialism for <I>dialectical</I> materialism, and not for relativism that sinks into subjectivism. "The mechanical theory," says Stallo, for instance, "in common with all metaphysical theories, hypostases partial, ideal, and, it may be, purely conventional groups of attributes, or single attributes, and

treats them as varieties of objective reality" (p. 150). This is quite true, if you do not deny objective reality and combat metaphysics for being anti-dialectical. Stallo does not realise this clearly. He has not understood materialist dialectics and therefore frequently slips, by way of relativism, into subjectivism and idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The same is true of Duhem. With an enormous expenditure of labour, and with the help of a number of interesting and valuable examples from the history of physics, such as one frequently encounters in Mach, he shows that "every law of physics is provisional and relative, because it is approximate" (p. 280). The man is hammering at an open door! -- will be the thought of the Marxist when he reads the lengthy disquisitions on this subject. But that is just the trouble with Duhem, Stallo, Mach and Poincar&eacute, that they do not perceive the door opened by dialectical materialism. Being unable to give a correct formulation of relativism, they slide from the latter into idealism. "A law of physics, properly speaking, is neither true nor false, but approximate" -- writes Duhem (p. 274). And this "but" contains the beginning of the falsity, the beginning of the obliteration of the boundary between a scientific theory that approximately <I>reflects the object</I>, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., approaches objective truth, and an arbitrary, fantastic, or purely conventional theory, such as, for example, a religious theory or the theory of the game of chess. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Duhem carries this falsity to the point of declaring that the question whether "material reality" corresponds to per ceptual phenomena is <I>metaphysics</I> (p. 10). Away with the question of reality! Our concepts and hypotheses are mere signs (p. 26), "arbitrary" (p. 27) constructions, and so forth. There is only one step from this to idealism, to the "physics 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 376</B></FONT><P>

of the believer," which M. Pierre Duhem preaches in the Kantian spirit (Rey, p. 162; cf., p. 160). But the good Adler (Fritz) -- also a Machian would-be Marxist! -- could find nothing cleverer to do than to "correct" Duhem as follows: Duhem, he claims, eliminates the "realities concealed behind phenomena only as objects of theory, but not as <I>objects of reality</I>."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp376">*</A>]</FONT> This is the familiar criticism of Kantianism from the standpoint of Hume and Berkeley. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But, of course, there can be no question of any conscious Kantianism on the part of Duhem. He is merely <I>vacillating</I> as is Mach, not knowing on what to base his relativism. In many passages he comes very close to dialectical materialism. He says that we know sound "such as it is in relation to us but not as it is in itself, in the sound-producing bodies. This reality, of which our sensations give us only the external and the veil, is made known to us by the theories of acoustics. They tell us that where our perceptions register only this appearance which we call sound, there really exists a very small and very rapid periodic movement," etc. (p. 7). Bodies are not symbols of sensations, but sensations are symbols (or rather, images) of bodies. "The development of physics gives rise to a constant struggle between nature, which does not tire of offering new material, and reason, which does not tire of cognising" (p. 32). Nature is infinite, just as its smallest particle (including the electron) is infinite, but reason just as infinitely transforms "things-in-themselves" into "things-for-us." "Thus, the struggle between reality and the laws of physics will continue indefinitely; to every law that physics may formulate, reality will

sooner or later oppose a rude refutation in the form of a fact; but, indefatigable, physics will improve, modify, and complicate the refuted law" (p. 290). This would be a quite correct exposition of dialectical materialism if the author firmly held to the existence of this objective reality independent of humanity. ". . . The theory of physics is not a purely artificial system which is convenient today and unsuitable tomorrow . . . it is a classification, which becomes more and more natural, a reflection, which grows clearer and clearer, of the realities that the experimental method cannot contemplate face to face" (p. 445). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In this last phrase the Machian Duhem flirts with Kantian idealism: it is as if the way is being opened for a method other than the "experimental" one, and as if we cannot know the "things-in-themselves" directly, immediately, face to face. But if the theory of physics becomes more and more natural, that means that "nature," reality, "reflected" by this theory, exists independently of our consciousness -- and that is precisely the view of dialectical materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In a word, the "physical" idealism of today, just as the "physiological" idealism of yesterday, merely means that one school of natural scientists in one branch of natural science has slid into a reactionary philosophy, being unable to rise directly and at once from metaphysical materialism to dialectical materialism.* This step is being made, and will

* The famous chemist, William Ramsay, says: "I have been frequently asked: 'But is not electricity a vibration? How can wireless telegraphy be explained by the passage of little particles or corpuscles?' The answer is: 'Electricity is a <I>thing </I>; it <I>is</I> (Ramsay's italics) these minute corpuscles, but when they leave an object, a wave, like a wave of light, spreads through the ether, and this wave is used for wireless telegraphy'" [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 378. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] (William Ramsay, <I>Essays</I>, <I>Biographical and Chemical</I>, London, 1908, p. 126). Having spoken about the transformation of radium into helium, Ramsay remarks: "At least one so-called element can no longer be regarded as ultimate matter, but is itself undergoing change into a simpler form of matter" (p. 160). "Now it is almost certain that negative electricity is a particular form of matter; and positive electricity is matter deprived of negative electricity -- that is, minus this electric matter" (p. 176). "Now what is electricity? It used to be believed, formerly, that there were two kinds of electricity, one called positive and the other negative. At that time it would not have been possible to answer the question. But recent researches make it probable that what used to be called negativc electricity is really a substance. Indeed, the relative weight of its particles has been measured; each is about one seven hundredth of the mass of an atom of hydrogen. . . . Atoms of electricity are named 'electrons' " (p. 196). If our Machians who write books and articles on philosophical subjects were capable of thinking, they would understand that the expression "matter disappears," "matter is reduced to electricity," etc., is only an epistemologically helpless expression of the truth that science is able to discover new forms of matter, new forms of material motion, to reduce the old forms to the new forms, and so on.

be made, by modern physics; but it is making for the only true method and the only true philosophy of natural science not directly, but by zigzags, not consciously but instinctively, not clearly perceiving its "final goal," but drawing closer to it gropingly, hesitatingly, and sometimes even with its back turned to it. Modern physics is in travail; it is giving birth to dialectical materialism. The process of child-birth is painful. And in addition to a living healthy being, there are bound to be produced certain dead products, refuse fit only for the garbage-heap. And the entire school of physical idealism, the entire empirio-critical philosophy, together with empirio-symbolism, empirio-monism, and so on, and so forth, must be regarded as such refuse!

  The Russian Machians, as we have already seen, are divided into two camps. Mr. V.

The other company of Machians, in whom we are more interested here, are would-be Marxists and try in every way to assure their readers that Machism is compatible with the historical materialism of Marx and Engels. True, these assurances are for the most part nothing but assurances; not a single Machian would-be Marxist has ever made the slightest attempt to present in any systematic way the real trends of the founders of empirio-criticism in the field of the social sciences. We shall dwell briefly on this question, turning first to the statements to be found in writings of the German empirio-criticists and then to those of their Russian disciples.

   In 1895, when R. Avenarius was still alive, there appeared in the philosophical journal edited by him an article by his disciple, F. Blei, entitled "Metaphysics in Political Economy."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp380">*</A>]</FONT> All the teachers of empirio-criticism wage war on the "metaphysics" not only of explicit and conscious philosophical materialism, but also of natural science, which instinctively adopts the standpoint of the materialist theory of knowledge. The disciple takes up arms against metaphysics in political economy. The fight is directed against the most varied schools of political economy, but we are interested only in the character of the empirio-critical argument against the school of Marx and Engels. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The purpose of the present investigation," writes Franz Blei, "is to show that all political economy until now, in its endeavour to interpret the phenomena of economic life, operates with metaphysical premises; that it . . . 'derives' the 'laws' governing an economy from the 'nature' of the latter, and man is only an incidental factor in relation to these 'laws.' . . . In all its theories political economy has hitherto rested on metaphysical grounds; all its theories are unbiological, and therefore unscientific and worthless for knowledge. . . . The theoreticians do not know what they are building their theories on, what the soil is of which these theories are the fruit. They regard themselves as realists operating without any premises whatever, for they are,

forsooth, dealing with 'sober' (<I>n&uumlchterne </I>), 'practical' and 'tangible' (<I>sinnf&aumlllige </I>) economic phenomena. . . . And all have that family resemblance to many trends in physiology which only the same parents -- <I>viz</I>., metaphysics and speculation -- can transmit to their children, in our case to the physiologists and economists. One school of economists analyses the 'phenomena' of 'economy' [Avenarius and his school put ordinary words in quotation marks in order to show that they, the true philosophers, discern the essentially "metaphysical character" of a use of words which is so vulgar and so unrefined by "epistemological analysis"] without placing what they find (<I>das Gefundene </I>) in this way into relation with the behaviour of individuals; the physiologists exclude the behaviour of the individual from their investigations as being 'actions of the soul' (<I>Wirkungen der Seele </I>), while the economists of this trend declare the behaviour of individuals to be negligible in relation to the 'immanent laws of economy' (pp. 378-79). With Marx, theory established 'economic laws' from construed processes, and these 'laws' figured in the initial section (<I>Initialabschnitt </I>) of the dependent vital series, while the economic processes figured in the final section (<I>Finalabschnitt </I>). . . . 'Economy' was transformed by the economists into a transcendental category, in which they discovered such 'laws' as they wished to discover: the 'laws' of 'capital' and 'labour,' 'rent,' 'wages' and 'profit.' The economists transformed man into a Platonic idea -- 'capitalist,' 'worker,' etc. Socialism ascribed to the 'capitalist' the character of being 'greedy for profit,' liberalism ascribed to the worker the character of being 'exacting' -- and both characters were moreover explained by the 'operation of the laws of capital'" (pp. 381-82). 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 382</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  "Marx came to the study of French socialism and political economy with a socialist world outlook, and his aim as regards knowledge was to provide a 'theoretical foundation' for his world outlook in order to 'safeguard' his initial value. He found the law of value in Ricardo . . . but the conclusion which the French Socialists had drawn from Ricardo could not<A NAME="p282"> satisfy Marx in his endeavour to 'safeguard' his E-value<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en115">115</A>]</FONT> brought into a vital-difference, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., his 'world outlook,' for these conclusions had already entered as a component part into the content of his initial value in the form of 'indignation at the robbery of the workers,' and so forth. The conclusions were rejected as 'being formally untrue economically' for they are 'simply an application of morality to political economy.' 'But what formally may be economically incorrect, may all the same be correct from the point of view of world history. If the moral consciousness of the mass declares an economic fact to be unjust, that is a proof that the fact itself has been outlived, that other economic facts have made their appearance, owing to which the former one has become unbearable and untenable. Therefore, a very true economic content may be concealed behind the formal economic incorrectness.'" (From Engels' preface to Karl Marx's <I>The Poverty of Philosophy</I>.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Having quoted the above passage from Engels, Blei continues: "In the above quotation the middle section (<I>Medial abschnitt </I>) of the dependent series which interests us here is detached [<I>abgehoben</I> -- a technical term of Avenarius' implying: reached the consciousness, separated off]. After the 'cognition' that an 'economic fact' must be concealed behind the 'moral consciousness of injustice,' comes the final section [<I>Finalabschnitt </I>: the theory of Marx is a statement, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., an E-value, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., a vital-difference which passes through 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 383</B></FONT><P>

three stages, three sections, initial, middle and final: <I>Initialabschnitt</I>, <I>Medialabschnitt</I>, <I>Finalabschnitt </I>] . . . <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the 'cognition' of that 'economic fact.' Or, in other words, the task now is to 'find again' the initial value, his 'world out look,' in the 'economic facts' in order to 'safeguard' the initial value. This definite variation of the dependent series already contains the Marxist metaphysics, regardless of how the 'cognised' appears in the final section (<I>Finalabschnitt </I>). 'The socialist world outlook,' as an independent E-value, 'absolute truth,' is 'given a basis' 'retrospectively' by means of a 'special' theory of knowledge, namely, the economic system of Marx and the materialist theory of history. . . . By means of the concept of surplus value the 'subjective' 'truth,' in the Marxist world outlook finds its 'objective truth,' in the theory of knowledge of the 'economic categories' -- the safeguarding of the initial value is completed and metaphysics has retrospectively received its critique of knowledge" (pp. 384-86). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The reader is probably fuming at us for quoting at such length this incredibly trivial rigmarole, this quasi-scientific tomfoolery decked out in the terminology of Avenarius. But <I>wer den Feind will verstehen, muss im Feindes Lande gehen</I> --<A NAME="p383"> who would know the enemy must go into the <I>enemy's</I> territory.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en116">116</A>]</FONT> And R. Avenarius' philosophical journal is indeed enemy territory for Marxists. And we invite the reader to restrain for a minute his legitimate aversion for the buffoons of bourgeois science and to analyse the argument of Avenarius' disciple and collaborator. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Argument number one: Marx is a "metaphysician" who did not grasp the epistemological "critique of concepts," who did not work out a general theory of knowledge and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 384</B></FONT><P>

who simply inserted materialism into his "special theory of knowledge." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This argument contains nothing original to Blei personally. We have already seen scores and hundreds of times that <I>all</I> the founders of empirio-criticism and <I>all</I> the Russian Machians accuse materialism of "metaphysics," or, more accurately, they repeat the hackneyed arguments of the Kantians, Humeans and idealists against materialist "metaphysics." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Argument number two: Marxism is as "metaphysical" as natural science (physiology). And here again it is not Blei who is "responsible" for this argument, but Mach and Avenarius; for it was they who declared war on "natural-historical metaphysics," applying that name to the instinctively materialist theory of knowledge to which (on their own admission and according to the judgment of all who are in any way versed in the subject) the vast majority of scientists adhere. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Argument number three: Marxism declares that "personality" is a <I>quantit&eacute n&eacutegligeable</I>, a cypher, that man is an "incidental factor," subject to certain "immanent laws of economics," that an analysis <I>des Gefundenen</I>, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of what is found, of what is given, etc., is lacking. This argument is a <I>complete</I> repetition of the stock of ideas of the empirio-critical "principal co-ordination," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., of the <I>idealist</I> crotchet in Avenarius' theory. Blei is absolutely right when he says that it is impossible to find the slightest hint of such idealist nonsense in Marx and Engels, and that from the standpoint of this nonsense Marxism must be rejected <I>completely</I>, from the very beginning, from its fundamental philosophical premises. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 385</B></FONT><P>

  Argument number four: Marx's theory is "unbiological," it is entirely innocent of "vital-differences" and of similar spurious biological terms which constitute the "science" of the reactionary professor, Avenarius. Blei's argument is correct from the standpoint of Machism, for the gulf between Marx's theory and Avenarius' "biological" spillikins is indeed obvious at once. We shall presently see how the Russian Machian would-be Marxists in effect followed in Blei's footsteps. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Argument number five: the partisanship, the partiality of Marx's theory and his preconceived solution. The empirio-criticists <I>as a whole</I>, and not Blei alone, claim to be non-partisan both in philosophy and in social science. They are neither for socialism nor for liberalism. They make no differentiation between the fundamental and irreconcilable trends of materialism and idealism in philosophy, but endeavour to <I>rise above</I> them. We have traced this tendency of Machism through a long series of problems of epistemology, and we ought not to be surprised when we encounter it in sociology. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Argument" number six: ridiculing "objective" truth. Blei at once sensed, and rightly sensed, that historical materialism and Marx's entire economic doctrine are permeated through and through by a recognition of objective truth. And Blei accurately expressed the tendency of Mach's and Avenarius' doctrines, when, precisely because of the idea of objective truth, he, "from the very threshold," so to speak, rejected Marxism by at once declaring that there was absolutely nothing behind the Marxist teaching save the "subjective" views of Marx. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And if our Machians renounce Blei (as they surely will), we shall tell them: You must not blame the mirror for 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 386</B></FONT><P>

showing a crooked face. Blei is a mirror which <I>accurately</I> reflects the tendencies of empirio-criticism, and a renouncement by our Machians would only bear witness to their good intentions -- and to their absurd eclectical endeavours to combine Marx and Avenarius. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us pass from Blei to Petzoldt. If the former is a mere disciple, the latter is declared by outstanding empirio-criticists, such as Lessevich, to be a master. While Blei brings up the question of Marxism explicitly, Petzoldt -- who would not demean himself by dealing with a mere Marx or a mere Engels -- sets forth in positive form the views of empirio-criticism on sociology, which enables us to compare them with Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The second volume of Petzoldt's <I>Einf&uumlhrung in die Philosophie der reinen Erfahrung</I> is entitled "<I>Auf dem Wege zum Dauernden </I>" ("Towards Stability"). The author makes the tendency towards stability the basis of his investigation. "The main features of the ultimate (<I>endg&uumlltige </I>) state of stability of humanity can be inferred in its formal aspect. We thus arrive at the foundations of ethics, aesthetics and the formal theory of knowledge" (p. iii). "Human development bears its goal within itself, it also tends towards a perfect (<I>vollkommene </I>) state of stability" (p. 60). The signs of this are abundant and varied. For instance, are there many violent radicals who do not in their old age become "more sensible," more restrained? True, this "premature stability" (p. 62) is characteristic of the philistine. But do not philistines constitute the "compact majority"? (p. 62.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our philosopher's conclusion, which he gives in italics, is this: "The quintessential feature of all the aims of our reasoning and creative activity is stability" (p. 72). The explanation is: "Many cannot bear to see a key Iying ob 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 387</B></FONT><P>

liquely on the table, still less a picture hanging crooked on the wall. . . . And such people are not necessarily pedants. . . . It is only that they have <I>a feeling that something is not in order </I>" (p. 72, Petzoldt's italics). In a word, the "tendency to stability is a striving for an extreme, by its nature ultimate, state" (p. 73). All this is taken from the fifth chapter of Volume II entitled "<I>Die psychische Tendenz zur Stabilit&aumlt </I>" ("The Psychical Tendency to Stability"). The proofs of this tendency are all very weighty. For instance: "A striving for an extreme, a highest, in the original spatial sense, is pursued by the majority of mountain climbers. It is not always the desire for a spacious view or joy in the physical exercise of climbing in fresh air and wide nature that urges them towards the peaks, but also the instinct which is deeply ingrained in every organic being to pursue an adopted path of activity until a natural aim has been achieved" (p. 73). Another example: the amount of money people will pay to secure a complete collection of postage stamps! "It makes one's head swim to examine the price list of a dealer in postage stamps. . . . And yet nothing is more natural and comprehensible than this urge for stability" (p. 74). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The philosophically untutored can have no conception of the breadth of the principles of stability and of economy of thought. Petzoldt develops his "theory" in detail for the profane. "Sympathy is an expression of the immediate need for a state of stability," runs &#167; 28. "Sympathy is not a repetition, a duplication of the observed suffering, but suffering on account of this suffering. . . . The greatest emphasis must be placed on the immediacy of sympathy. If we admit this we thereby admit that the welfare of others can concern a man just as immediately and fundamentally as his own wel-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 388</B></FONT><P>

fare, and we thus at the same time reject every utilitarian and eudemonistic foundation of ethics. Thanks to its longing for stability and peace, human nature is not fundamentally evil, but anxious to help. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The immediacy of sympathy is frequently manifested in the immediacy of help. The rescuer will often fling himself without thought to save a drowning man. He cannot bear the sight of a person struggling with death; he forgets his other duties and risks his own life and the life of his near ones in order to save the useless life of some degraded drunkard; in other words, under certain circumstances sympathy can drive one to actions that are morally unjustifiable." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And scores and hundreds of pages of empirio-critical philosophy are filled with such unutterable platitudes! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Morality is deduced from the concept "moral state of stability" (The second section of Volume II: "<I>Die Dauerbestande der Seele </I>" ["Stable States of the Soul"], Chapter I, "<I>Vom ethischen Dauerbestande </I>" ["On Ethical Stable States"]). "The state of stability, according to the very concept of it, contains no conditions of change in any of its components. From this it at once follows that it can contain no possibility of <I>war </I>" (p. 202). "Economic and social equality is implied in the conception of the final (<I>endgultig </I>), stable state" (p. 213). This "state of stability" is derived not from religion but from "science." The "majority" cannot bring it about, as the socialists suppose, nor can the power of the socialists "help humanity" (p. 207). Oh, no! -- it is "free development" that will lead to the ideal. Are not, indeed, the profits of capital decreasing and are not wages constantly increasing? (p. 223). All the assertions about "wage slavery" are untrue (p. 229). A slave's leg could be broken with impunity -- but now? No, "moral progress" is beyond 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 389</B></FONT><P>

doubt; look at the university settlements in England, at the Salvation Army (p. 230), at the German "ethical societies." In the name of "aesthetic stability" (Chapter II, Section 2) "romanticism" is rejected. But romanticism embraces all forms of inordinate extension of the ego, idealism, metaphysics, occultism, solipsism, egoism, the "forcible coercion of the minority by the majority" and the "social-democratic ideal of the organisation of all labour by the state" (pp. 240-41).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp389">*</A>]</FONT>  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The sociological excursions of Blei, Petzoldt and Mach are but an expression of the infinite stupidity of the philistine, smugly retailing the most hackneyed rubbish under cover of a new "empirio-critical" systematisation and terminology. A pretentious cloak of verbal artifices, clumsy devices in syllogistic, subtle scholasticism, in a word, as in epistemology, so in sociology -- the same reactionary content under the same flamboyant signboard.

<A NAME="p390">
to the <I>Zur Kritik</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en117">117</A>]</FONT> where the "great sociologist," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., Marx, expounds the principles of historical materialism. Having quoted Marx's words, Bogdanov declares that the "old formulation of historical monism, without ceasing to be basically true, no longer fully satisfies us" (p. 37). The author wishes, therefore, to correct the theory, or to develop it, <I>starting from the principles of the theory itself</I>. The author's chief conclusion is as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "We have shown that social forms belong to the comprehensive <I>genus</I> -- biological adaptations. But we have not thereby defined the province of social forms; for a definition, not only the <I>genus</I>, but also the <I>species</I> must be established. . . . In their struggle for existence men can unite only with the help of <I>consciousness </I>: without consciousness there can be no intercourse. Hence, <I>social life in all its manifestations is a consciously psychical life</I>. . . . Society is inseparable from consciousness. <I>Social being and social consciousness are</I>, <I>in the exact meaning of these terms, identical </I>" (pp. 50, 51, Bogdanov's italics). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That this conclusion is absolutely alien to Marxism has been pointed out by Orthodox (<I>Philosophical Essays</I>, St. Petersburg, 1906, p. 183, ff.). But Bogdanov responded simply by abuse, picking upon an <I>error</I> in quotation: instead of "in the exact meaning of these terms," Orthodox had quoted "in the full meaning of these terms." This error was indeed committed, and the author had every right to correct it; but to raise a cry of "mutilation," "substitution," and so forth (<I>Empirio-Monism</I>, Bk. III, p. xliv), is simply to <I>obscure</I> the essence of the point at issue by wretched words. What ever "exact" meaning Bogdanov may have invented for the terms "social being" and "social consciousness," there can be no doubt that the statement we have quoted is not <I>correct</I>. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 391</B></FONT><P>

"Social being" and "social consciousness" are not identical, just as being in general and consciousness in general are not identical. From the fact that in their intercoutse men act as conscious beings, it <I>does not follow</I> that social consciousness is identical with social being. In all social formations of any complexity -- and in the capitalist social formation in particular -- people in their intercourse are <I>not conscious</I> of what kind of social relations are being formed, in accordance with what laws they develop, etc. For instance, a peasant when he sells his grain enters into "intercourse" with the world producers of grain in the world market, but he is not conscious of it; nor is he conscious of the kind of social relations that are formed on the basis of exchange. Social consciousness <I>reflects</I> social being -- that is Marx's teaching. A reflection may be an approximately true copy of the reflected, but to speak of identity is absurd. Consciousness in general <I>reflects</I> being -- that is a general principle of <I>all</I> materialism. It is impossible not to see its direct and <I>inseparable</I> connection with the principle of historical materialism: social consciousness <I>reflects</I> social being.

   Bogdanov's attempt imperceptibly to correct and develop Marx in the "spirit of his principles" is an obvious distortion of these <I>materialist</I> principles in the spirit of <I>idealism</I>. It would be ludicrous to deny it. Let us recall Bazarov's exposition of empirio-criticism (not empirio-monism, oh no! -- there is such a wide, wide difference between these "systems"!): "sense-perception <I>is</I> the reality existing outside us." This is plain idealism, a plain theory of the identity of consciousness and being. Recall, further, the formulation of W. Schuppe, the immanentist (who swore and vowed as fervently as Bazarov and Co. that he was not an idealist, and who with no less vigour than Bogdanov insisted on the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 392</B></FONT><P>

very "exact" meaning of his terms): "being is consciousness." Now compare this with the <I>refutation</I> of Marx's historical materialism by the immanentist Schubert-Soldern: "Every material process of production is always an act of consciousness on the part of its observer. . . . In its epistemological aspect, it is not the external process of production that is the <I>primary</I> (<I>prius </I>), but the subject or subjects; in other words, even the purely material process of production does not lead us out of the general connection of consciousness (<I>Bewu&#223;tseinszusammenhang </I>)." (See <I>Das menschliche Gl&uumlck und die soziale Frage</I>, S. 293, 295-96.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov may curse the materialists as much as he pleases for "mutilating his thoughts," but no curses will alter the simple and plain fact. The correction of Marx's theory and the development of Marx supposedly in the spirit of Marx by the "empirio-monist" Bogdanov <I>in no essential respect</I> differ from the way the idealist and epistemological solipsist Schubert-Soldern endeavours to refute Marx. Bogdanov assures us that he is not an idealist. Schubert-Soldern assures us that he is a realist (Bazarov even believed him). In our time a philosopher has to declare himself a "realist" and an "enemy of idealism." It is about time you understood this, Messrs. Machians! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The immanentists, the empirio-criticists and the empirio-monists all argue over particulars, over details, over the formulation of <I>idealism</I>, whereas we <I>from the very outset</I> reject all the principles of their philosophy common to this trinity. Let Bogdanov, accepting in the best sense and with the best of intentions <I>all the conclusions</I> of Marx, preach the "identity" of social being and social consciousness; we shall say: Bogdanov <I>minus</I> "empirio-monism" (or rather, <I>minus</I> Machism) is a Marxist. For this theory of the identity of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 393</B></FONT><P>

social being and social consciousness is <I>sheer nonsense</I> and an <I>absolutely reactionary</I> theory. If certain people reconcile it with Marxism, with Marxist behaviour, we must admit that these people are better than their theory, but we cannot justify outrageous theoretical distortions of Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov reconciles his theory with Marx's conclusions, and sacrifices elementary consistency for the sake of these conclusions. Every individual producer in the world economic system realises that he is introducing a certain change into the technique of production; every owner realises that he exchanges certain products for others; but these producers and these owners do not realise that in doing so they are thereby changing <I>social being</I>. The sum-total of these changes in all their ramifications in the capitalist world economy could not be grasped even by seventy Marxes. The paramount thing is that the <I>laws</I> of these changes have been discovered, that the <I>objective</I> logic of these changes and their historical development have at bottom and in the main been disclosed -- objective, not in the sense that a society of conscious beings, men, could exist and develop independently of the existence of conscious beings (and it is only such trifles that Bogdanov <I>stresses</I> by his "theory"), but in the sense that social being is <I>independent</I> of <I>the social consciousness</I> of men. The fact that you live and conduct your business, beget children, produce products and exchange them, gives rise to an objectively necessary chain of events, a chain of development, which is independent of your <I>social</I> consciousness, and is never grasped by the latter completely. The highest task of humanity is to comprehend this objective logic of economic evolution (the evolution of social life) in its general and fundamental features, so that it may be possible to adapt <I>to it</I> one's social consciousness and the con-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 394</B></FONT><P>

sciousness of the advanced classes of all capitalist countries in as definite, clear and critical a fashion as possible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov admits all this. And what does this mean? It means <I>in effect</I> that his theory of the "identity of social being and social consciousness" is thrown overboard, that it becomes an empty scholastic appendage, as empty, dead and useless as the "theory of general substitution" or the doctrine of "elements," "introjection" and the rest of the Machian rigmarole. But the "dead lay hold of the living"; the dead scholastic appendage, <I>against the will of and independently of the consciousness</I> of Bogdanov, converts his philosophy into a <I>serviceable tool</I> of the Schubert-Solderns and other reactionaries, who in a thousand different keys, from a hundred professorial chairs, disseminate <I>this</I> dead thing as a living thing, direct it against the living thing, for the purpose of stifling it. Bogdanov personally is a sworn enemy of reaction in general and of bourgeois reaction in particular. Bogdanov's "substitution" and theory of the "identity of social being and social consciousness" <I>serve</I> this reaction. It is sad, but true. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Materialism in general recognises objectively real being (matter) as independent of consciousness, sensation, experience, etc., of humanity. Historical materialism recognises social being as independent of the social consciousness of humanity. In both cases consciousness is only the reflection of being, at best an approximately true (adequate, perfectly exact) reflection of it. From this Marxist philosophy, which is cast from a single piece of steel, you cannot eliminate one basic premise, one essential part, without departing from objective truth, without falling a prey to a bourgeois-reactionary falsehood. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 395</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here are further examples of how the dead philosophy of idealism lays hold of the living Marxist Bogdanov. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The article "What Is Idealism?" 1901 (<I>ibid</I>., p. 11 <I>et seq</I>.): "We arrive at the following conclusion: both where people agree in their judgments of progress and where they disagree, the basic meaning of the idea of progress is the same, namely, <I>increasing completeness and harmony of conscious life</I>. This is the objective content of the concept progress. . . . If we now compare the psychological formulation of the idea of progress thus arrived at with the previously explained biological formulation ["biological <I>progress is</I> an <I>increase in the sum-total of life</I>," p. 14], we shall easily convince ourselves that the former fully coincides with the latter and can be deduced from it. . . . And since social life amounts to the psychical life of members of society, here too the content of the idea of progress is the same -- increase in the completeness and harmony of life; only we must add: the <I>social</I> life of men. And, of course, the idea of social progress never had and cannot have any other content" (p. 16). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "We have found . . . that idealism expresses the victory in the human soul of moods more social over moods less social, that a progressive ideal is a reflection of the socially progressive tendency in the idealist psychology" (p. 32). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It need hardly be said that all this play with biology and sociology contains <I>not a grain</I> of Marxism. Both in Spencer and Mikhailovsky one may find any number of definitions not a whit worse than this, defining nothing but the "good intentions" of the author and betraying a <I>complete lack of understanding</I> of "what is idealism" and what materialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The author begins Book III of <I>Empirio-Monism</I>, the article "Social Selection (Foundations of Method)," 1906, by refut-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 396</B></FONT><P>

ing the "eclectic socio-biological attempts of Lange, Ferri, Woltmann and many others" (p. 1), and on page 15 we find the following conclusion of the "enquiry": "We can formulate the fundamental connection between energetics and social selection as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>Every act of social selection represents an increase or decrease of the energy of the social complex concerned. In the former case we have 'positive selection,' in the latter 'negative selection</I>.'" (Author's italics.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And such unutterable trash is served out as Marxism! Can one imagine anything more sterile, lifeless and scholastic than this string of biological and energeticist terms that contribute nothing, and can contribute nothing, in the sphere of the social sciences? There is not a shadow of concrete economic enquiry here, not a hint of the Marxist <I>method</I>, the method of dialectics and the world outlook of materialism, only a mere <I>invention</I> of definitions and attempts to fit them into the ready-made conclusions of Marxism. "The rapid growth of the productive forces of capitalist society is undoubtedly an increase in the energy of the social whole. . . . " The second half of the phrase is undoubtedly a simple repetition of the first half expressed in meaningless terms which seem to lend "profundity" to the question, but which in reality <I>in no way</I> differ from the eclectic biologico-sociological attempts of Lange and Co.! -- "but the disharmonious character of this process leads to its culmination in a crisis, in a vast waste of productive forces, in a sharp decrease of energy: positive selection is replaced by negative selection" (p. 18). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In what way does this differ from Lange? A biologico-energeticist label is tacked on to ready-made conclusions on the subject of crises, without any concrete material whatever 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 397</B></FONT><P>

being added and without the nature of crises being elucidated. All this is done with the very best intentions, for the author wishes to corroborate and give greater depth to Marx's conclusions; but in point of fact he only <I>dilutes</I> them with an intolerably dreary and lifeless scholasticism. The only "Marxism" here is a <I>repetition</I> of an already known conclusion, and all the "new" proof of it, all this "<I>social energetics </I>" (p. 34) and "social selection" is but a mere <I>collection of words</I> and a sheer mockery of Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bogdanov is not engaged in a Marxist enquiry at all; all he is doing is to reclothe results already obtained by the Marxist enquiry in a biological and energeticist terminology. The whole attempt is worthless from beginning to end, for the concepts "selection," "assimilation and dissimilation" of energy, the energetic balance, and so forth, are, when applied to the sphere of the social sciences, but <I>empty phrases</I>. In fact, an <I>enquiry</I> into social phenomena and an elucidation of the <I>method</I> of the social sciences <I>cannot</I> be undertaken with the aid of these concepts. Nothing is easier than to tack the labels of "energetics" or "biologico-sociology" on to such phenomena as crises, revolutions, the class struggle and so forth; but neither is there anything more sterile, more scholastic and lifeless than such an occupation. The important thing is not that Bogdanov tries to fit <I>all</I> his results and conclusions into the Marxist theory -- or "nearly" all (we have seen the "correction" he made on the subject of the relation of social being to social consciousness) -- but that the <I>methods</I> of fitting -- this "social energetics" -- are thoroughly false and in no way differ from the methods of Lange. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Herr Lange (<I>On the Labour Question</I>, etc., 2nd ed.)," Marx wrote to Kugelmann on June 27, 1870, "sings my 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 398</B></FONT><P>

praises loudly, but with the object of making himself im portant. Herr Lange, you see, has made a great discovery. The whole of history can be brought under a single great natural law. This natural law is the <I>phrase</I> (in this application Darwin's expression becomes nothing but a phrase) 'struggle for life,' and the content of this phrase is the Malthusian law of population or, rather, over-population. So, instead of analysing the 'struggle for life' as represented historically in various definite forms of society, all that has to be done is to translate every concrete struggle into the phrase 'struggle for life,' and this phrase itself into the Malthusian 'population fantasy.' One must admit that this is a very impressive method<A NAME="p398"> -- for swaggering, sham-scientific, bombastic ignorance and intellectual laziness."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en118">118</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The basis of Marx's criticism of Lange is not that Lange foists Malthusianism in particular upon sociology, but that the transfer of biological concepts in <I>general</I> to the sphere of the social sciences is <I>phrasemongering</I>. Whether the transfer is undertaken with "good" intentions, or with the purpose of bolstering up false sociological conclusions, the phrase mongering none the less remains phrasemongering. And Bogdanov's "social energetics," his coupling of the doctrine of social selection with Marxism, is just such phrasemongering. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Just as in epistemology Mach and Avenarius did not develop idealism, but only overlaid the <I>old</I> idealist errors with a bombastic terminological rigmarolc ("elements," "principal co-ordination," "introjection," etc.), so in sociology, even when there is sincere sympathy for Marxist conclusions, empirio-criticism results in a distortion of historical materialism by means of empty and bombastic energeticist and biological verbiage. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 399</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  A historical peculiarity of modern Russian Machism (or rather of the Machian epidemic among a section of the Social-Democrats) is the following. Feuerbach was a "materialist below and an idealist above"; this to a certain extent applies also to B&uumlchner, Vogt, Moleschott and D&uumlhring, with the essential difference that all these philosophers were pygmies and wretched bunglers compared with Feuerbach. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marx and Engels, as they grew out of Feuerbach and matured in the fight against the bunglers, naturally paid most attention to crowning the structure of philosophical materialism, that is, not to the materialist epistemology but to the materialist conception of history. That is why Marx and Engels laid the emphasis in their works rather on <I>dialectical materialism</I> than on dialectical <I>materialism</I>, why they insisted rather on <I>historical</I> materialism than on historical <I>materialism</I>. Our would-be Marxist Machians approached Marxism in an entirely different historical period, at a time when bourgeois philosophers were particularly specialising in epistemology, and, having assimilated in a one-sided and mutilated form certain of the component parts of dialectics (relativism, for instance), directed their attention chiefly to a defence or restoration of idealism below and not of idealism above. At any rate, positivism in general, and Machism in particular, have been much more concerned with subtly falsifying epistemology, assuming the guise of materialism and concealing their idealism under a pseudo-materialist terminology, and have paid comparatively little attention to the philosophy of history. Our Machians did not understand Marxism because they happened to approach it <I>from the other side</I>, so to speak, and they have assimilated -- and at times not so much assimilated as learnt by rote -- Marx's economic and historical theory, without clearly apprehending 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 400</B></FONT><P>

its foundation, <I>viz</I>., philosophical materialism. And the result is that Bogdanov and Co. deserve to be called Russian B&uumlchners and D&uumlhrings turned inside out. They want to be materialists above, but are unable to rid themselves of muddled idealism below! In the case of Bogdanov, "above" there is historical materialism, vulgarised, it is true, and much corrupted by idealism, "below" there is idealism, disguised in Marxist terminology and decked out in Marxist words. "Socially organised experience," "collective labour process," and so forth are Marxist words, but they are <I>only words</I>, concealing an idealist philosophy that declares things to be complexes of "elements," of sensations, the external world to be "experience," or an "empirio-symbol" of mankind, physical nature to be a "product" of the "psychical," and so on and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   An ever subtler falsification of Marxism, an ever subtler presentation of anti-materialist doctrines under the guise of Marxism -- this is the characteristic feature of modern revisionism in political economy, in questions of tactics and in philosophy generally, both in epistemology and in sociology.

                                   3.&nbsp;SUVOROV'S "FOUNDATIONS OF<BR>
                                             SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY"
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The <I>Studies</I> "<I>in" the Philosophy of Marxism</I>, the concluding article in which is the one by Comrade S. Suvorov mentioned above, by very reason of the collective nature of the book constitutes an unusually potent bouquet. When you have at one time and side by side the utterances of Bazarov, who says that according to Engels "sense-perception is the reality existing outside us," of Berman, who declares 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 401</B></FONT><P>

the dialectics of Marx and Engels to be mysticism, of Lunacharsky, who goes to the length of religion, of Yushkevich, who introduces "the Logos into the irrational stream of experience," of Bogdanov, who calls idealism the philosophy of Marxism, of Helfond, who purges J. Dietzgen of materialism, and lastly, of S. Suvorov with his article "Foundations of Social Philosophy" -- you at once get the "aroma" of the new alignment. Quantity has passed into quality. The "seekers," who had heretofore been seeking separately in individual articles and books, have come out with a veritable pronunciamento. Individual disagreements among them are obliterated by the very fact of their collective appearance <I>against</I> (and not "in") the philosophy of Marxism, and the reactionary features of Machism as a current become manifest. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Under these circumstances, Suvorov's article is all the more interesting for the fact that the author is neither an empirio-monist nor an empirio-criticist, but simply a "realist." What relates him, therefore, to the rest of the company is not what distinguishes Bazarov, Yushkevich and Bogdanov as philosophers, but what they all have in common <I>against</I> dialectical materialism. A comparison of the sociological arguments of this "realist" with the arguments of the empirio-monist will help us to depict their <I>common</I> tendency. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Suvorov writes: "In the gradation of the laws that regulate the world process, the particular and complex become reduced to the general and simple, and all of them are subordinate to the universal law of development -- <I>the law of the economy of forces</I>. The essence of this law is that <I>every system of forces is the more capable of conservation and development the less its expenditure</I>, <I>the greater its accumulation and the more effectively expenditure serves</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 402</B></FONT><P>

<I>accumulation</I>. The forms of mobile equilibrium, which long ago evoked the idea of objective expediency (the solar system, the cycle of terrestrial phenomena, the process of life), arise and develop by virtue of the conservation and accumulation of the energy inherent in them -- by virtue of their intrinsic economy. The law of economy of forces is the unifying and regulating principle of all development -- inorganic, biological and social" (p. 293, author's italics). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    With what remarkable ease do our "positivists" and "realists" turn out "universal laws"! What a pity these laws are no whit better than those turned out as easily and swiftly by Eugen D&uumlhring. Suvorov's "universal law" is just as empty and bombastic a phrase as D&uumlhring's universal laws. Try to apply this law to the first of the three fields mentioned by the author -- inorganic development. You will see that no "economy of forces" apart from the law of the conservation and transformation of energy can be applied here, let alone applied "universally." And the author had already disposed of the law of the "conservation of energy," had already mentioned it (p. 292) as a separate law.* What then remained in the field of inorganic development apart from this law? Where are the additions or complications, or new discoveries, or new facts which entitled the author to modify ("perfect") the law of the conservation and trans-

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
* It is characteristic that Suvorov calls the discovery of the law of the conservation and transformation of energy "the establishment of the basic principles of <I>energetics </I>" (p. 292). Has our would-be Marxist "realist" ever heard of the fact that the vulgar materialists, B&uumlchner and Co., and the dialectical materialist, Engels, regarded this law as the establishment of the basic principles of <I>materialism </I>? Has our "realist" ever reflected on the meaning of this difference? He has not: he has merely followed the fashion, repeated Ostwald, and that is all. That [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 403. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] is just the trouble: "realists" like this succumb to fashion, while Engels, for instance, <I>assimilated the</I>, <I>to him</I>, <I>new term</I>, energy, and began to employ it in 1885 (Preface to the 2nd ed. of <I>Anti-D&uumlhring </I>) and in 1888 (<I>Ludwig Feuerbach </I>), but to employ it equally with the concepts "force" and "motion" and along with them. Engels was able to enrich his <I>materialism</I> by adopting a new terminology. The "realists" and other muddleheads seized upon the new term without noticing the difference between materialism and energetics! 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 403</B></FONT><P>

formation of energy into the law of the "<I>economy of forces </I>"? There are no such facts or discoveries;<A NAME="p403"> Suvorov does not even hint at them. He simply -- to make it look impressive, as Turgenev's Bazarov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en119">119</A>]</FONT> used to say -- flourished his pen and forth came a new "universal law" of "real-monistic philosophy" (p. 292). That's the stuff we are made of! How are we worse than D&uumlhring? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take the second field of development -- the biological. In this field, where the development of organisms takes place by the struggle for existence and selection, is it the law of the economy of forces or the "law" of the wastage of forces that is universal? But never mind! "Real-monistic philosophy" can interpret the "<I>meaning </I>" of a universal law in one field in one way and in another field in another way, for instance, as the development of <I>higher</I> organisms from lower. What does it matter if the universal law is thus transformed into an empty phrase -- the principle of "monism" is preserved. And in the third field (the social), the "universal law" can be interpreted in a third sense -- as the development of productive forces. That is why it is a "universal law" -- so that it can be made to cover anything you please. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Although social science is still young, it already possesses both a solid foundation and definite generalisations; in the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 404</B></FONT><P>

nineteenth century it reached a theoretical level -- and this constitutes Marx's chief merit. He elevated social science to the level of a social theory [Engels said that Marx trans formed socialism from a utopia into a science, but this is not enough for Suvorov. It will sound more impressive if we <I>distinguish theory from science</I> (was there a social science before Marx?) -- and no harm is done if the distinction is absurd!]. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . by establishing the fundamental law of social dynamics according to which the evolution of productive forces is the determining principle of all economic and social development. But the development of productive forces corresponds to the growth of the productivity of labour, to the relative reduction in expenditure and the increase in the accumulation of energy [see how fertile the "real-monistic philosophy" is: a new, energeticist, foundation for Marxism has been created!] . . . this is the economic principle. Thus, Marx made the principle of the economy of forces the foundation of the social theory. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This "thus" is truly superb! <I>Because</I> Marx has a political economy, let us <I>therefore</I> chew the <I>word</I> "economy," and call the cud "real-monistic philosophy"! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No, Marx did not make any principle of the economy of forces the basis of his theory. These are absurdities invented by people who covet the laurels of Eugen D&uumlhring. Marx gave an absolutely precise definition of the concept growth of productive forces, and he studied the concrete process of this growth. But Suvorov invented a new term to designate the concept analysed by Marx; and his invention was a very unhappy one and only confused matters. For Suvorov did not explain what is meant by the "economy of forces," how it can be measured, how this concept can be applied, what 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 405</B></FONT><P>

precise and definite facts it embraces; -- and this cannot be explained, because it is a muddle. Listen to this: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   " . . . This law of social economy is not only the principle of the internal unity of social science [can you make anything of this, reader?], but also the connecting link between social theory and the general theory of being" (p. 294). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Well, well, here we have "the general theory of being" once more discovered by S. Suvorov, after it has already been discovered many times and in the most varied forms by numerous representatives of scholastic philosophy. We congratulate the Russian Machians on this new "general theory of being"! Let us hope that their next collective work will be entirely devoted to the demonstration and development of this great discovery! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The way our representative of realistic, or real-monistic, philosophy expounds Marx's theory will be seen from the following example: "In general, the productive forces of men form a genetic gradation [ugh!] and consist of their labour energy, harnessed elemental forces, culturally modihed nature and the instruments of labour which make up the technique of production. . . . In relation to the process of labour these forces perform a purely economic function; they economise labour energy and increase the productivity of its expenditure" (p. 298). Productive forces perform an economic function in relation to the process of labour! This is just as though one were to say that vital forces perform a vital function in relation to the process of life. This is not expounding Marx; this is clogging up Marxism with an incredible clutter of words. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is impossible to enumerate all the clutter contained in Suvorov's article. "The socialisation of a class is expressed in the growth of its collective power over both people and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 406</B></FONT><P>

their property" (p. 313). " . . . The class struggle aims at establishing forms of equilibrium between social forces" (p. 322). Social dissension, enmity and struggle are essentially negative, anti-social phenomena. "Social progress, in its basic content, is the growth of social relations, of the social connections between people" (p. 328). One could fill volumes with collections of such banalities -- and the representatives of bourgeois sociology are filling volumes with them. But to pass them off as the philosophy of Marxism -- that is going too far! If Suvorov's article were an experiment in popularising Marxism, one would not judge it very severely. Everyone would admit that the author's intentions were of the best but that the experiment was unsuccessful. And that would be the end of it. But when a group of Machians present us with such stuff and call it the <I>Foundations of Social Philosophy</I>, and when we see the same methods of "developing" Marxism employed in Bogdanov's philosophical books, we arrive at the inevitable conclusion that there is an intimate connection between reactionary epistemology and reactionary efforts in sociology.

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  It remains for us to examine the relation between Machism and religion. But this broadens into the question of whether there are parties generally in philosophy, and what is meant by non-partisanship in philosophy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Throughout the preceding exposition, in connection with every problem of epistemology touched upon and in connection with every philosophical question raised by the new 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 407</B></FONT><P>

physics, we traced the struggle between <I>materialism</I> and <I>idealism</I>. Behind the mass of new terminological devices, behind the litter of erudite scholasticism, we invariably discerned <I>two</I> principal alignments, two fundamental trends in the solution of philosophical problems. Whether nature, matter, the physical, the external world should be taken as primary, and consciousness, mind, sensation (experience --  as the <I>widespread</I> terminology of our time has it), the psychical, etc., should be regarded as secondary -- that is the root question which <I>in fact</I> continues to divide the philosophers into <I>two great camps</I>. The source of thousands upon thousands of errors and of the confusion reigning in this sphere is the fact that beneath the envelope of terms, definitions, scholastic devices and verbal artihces, these two fundamental trends are <I>overlooked</I>. (Bogdanov, for instance, refuses to acknowledge his idealism, because, you see, instead of the "metaphysical" concepts "nature" and "mind," he has taken the "experiential": physical and psychical.

   The genius of Marx and Engels consisted in the very fact that in the course of a long period, <I>nearly half a century</I>, they developed materialism, that they further advanced one fundamental trend in philosophy, that they did not stop at reiterating epistemological problems that had already been solved, but consistently applied -- and showed <I>how</I> to apply -- <I>this same</I> materialism in the sphere of the social sciences, mercilessly brushing aside as litter and rubbish the pretentious rigmarole, the innumerable attempts to "discover" a "new" line in philosophy, to invent a "new" trend and so forth. The verbal nature of such attempts, the scholastic play with new philosophical "isms," the clogging of the issue by pretentious devices, the inability to comprehend and

clearly present the struggle between the two fundamental epistemological trends -- this is what Marx and Engels persistently pursued and fought against throughout their entire activity. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    We said, "nearly half a century." And, indeed, as far back as 1843, when Marx was only becoming Marx, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the founder of scientific socialism, the founder of <I>modern materialism</I>, which is immeasurably richer in content and in comparably more consistent than all preceding forms of materialism, even at that time Marx pointed out with amazing clarity the basic trends in philosophy. Karl Gr&uumln quotes a letter from Marx to Feuerbach<A NAME="p408"> dated October 20, 1843,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en120">120</A>]</FONT> in which Marx invites Feuerbach to write an article for the <I>Deutsch-Franz&oumlsische Jahrb&uumlcher </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en121">121</A>]</FONT> against Schelling. This Schelling, writes Marx, is a shallow braggart with his claims to having embraced and transcended all previous philosophical trends. "To the French romanticists and mystics he [Schelling] says: I am the union of philosophy and theology; to the French materialists: I am the union of the flesh and the idea; to the French sceptics: I am the destroyer of dogmatism."* That the "sceptics," be they called Humeans or Kantians (or, in the twentieth century, Machians), cry out against the "dogmatism" of both materialism and idealism, Marx at that time already realised; and, without letting himself be diverted by any one of a thousand wretched little philosophical systems, he was able through Feuerbach to take the direct materialist road as against idealism. Thirty years later, in the afterword to the second edition of the first

volume of <I>Capital</I>, Marx just as clearly and definitely contrasted <I>his materialism</I> to Hegel's <I>idealism</I>, the most consistent and developed idealism of all; he contemptuously brushed Comtean "positivism" aside and dubbed as wretched epigoni the contemporary philosophers who imagined that they had destroyed Hegel when in reality they had reverted to a repetition of the pre-Hegelian errors of Kant and Hume. In the letter to Kugelmann of June 27, 1870, Marx refers just as contemptuously to "B&uumlchner, Lange, D&uumlhring, Fechner, etc.," because they understood nothing of Hegel's dialectics and treated him with scorn.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp409">*</A>]</FONT> And finally, take the various philosophical utterances by Marx in <I>Capital</I> and other works, and you will find an <I>invariable</I> basic motif, <I>viz</I>., insistence upon materialism and contemptuous derision of all obscurity, of all confusion and all deviations towards <I>idealism</I>. <I>All</I> Marx's philosophical utterances revolve within these two fundamental opposites, and, in the eyes of professorial philosophy, their defect lies in this "narrowness" and "one-sidedness." As a matter of fact, this refusal to recognise the hybrid projests for reconciling materialism and idealism constitutes the great merit of Marx, who moved <I>forward</I> along a sharply-dehned philosophical road. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Entirely in the spirit of Marx, and in close collaboration with him, Engels in all his philosophical works briefly and clearly contrasts the materialist and idealist lines in regard to <I>all</I> questions,<A NAME="p409"> without, either in 1878, or 1888, or 1892,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en124">124</A>]</FONT> taking seriously the endless attempts to "transcend" the

"one-sidedness" of materialism and idealism, to proclaim a <I>new</I> trend -- "positivism," "realism," or some other professorial charlatanism. Engels based his <I>whole</I> fight against D&uumlhring on the demand for consistent adherence to materialism, accusing the materialist D&uumlhring of verbally confusing the issue, of phrasemongering, of methods of reasoning which involved a compromise with idealism and adoption of the position of idealism. Either materialism consistent to the end, or the falsehood and confusion of philosophical idealism -- such is the formulation of the question given in <I>every paragraph</I> of <I>Anti-D&uumlhring </I>; and only people whose minds had already been corrupted by reactionary professorial philosophy could fail to notice it. And right down to 1894, when the last preface was written to <I>Anti-D&uumlhring</I>, revised and enlarged by the author for the last time, Engels continued to follow the latest developments both in philosophy and science, and continued with all his former resoluteness to hold to his lucid and firm position, brushing away the litter of new systems, big and little. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That Engels followed the new developments in philosophy is evident from <I>Ludwig Feuerbach</I>. In the 1888 preface, mention is even made of such a phenomenon as the rebirth of classical German philosophy in England and Scandinavia, whereas Engels (both in the preface and in the text of the book) has nothing but the most extreme contempt for the prevailing Neo-Kantianism and Humism. It is quite obvious that Engels, observing the repetition by <I>fashionable</I> German and English philosophy of the old pre-Hegelian errors of Kantianism and Humism, was prepared to expect some good even <I>from the turn to Hegel</I> (in England and Scandinavia), hoping that the great idealist and dialectician would help to disclose petty idealist and metaphysical errors. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 411</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Without undertaking an examination of the vast number of shades of Neo-Kantianism in Germany and of Humism in England, Engels <I>from the very outset</I> refutes their fundamental deviation from materialism. Engels declares that the <I>entire tendency</I> of these two schools is "<I>scientifically a step backward</I>." And what is his opinion of the undoubtedly "positivist," according to the current terminology, the undoubtedly "realist" tendencies of these Neo-Kantians and Humeans, among whose number, for instance, he could not help knowing Huxley? That "positivism" and that "realism" which attracted, and which continue to attract, an infinite number of muddleheads, Engels declared to be <I>at&nbsp;b e s t&nbsp;a philistine method of smuggling in materialism</I> while abusing and abjuring it publicly! One has to reflect only very little on <I>such</I> an appraisal of Thomas Huxley -- a very great scientist and an incomparably more realistic realist and positive positivist than Mach, Avenarius and Co. -- in order to understand how contemptuously Engels would have greeted the present infatuation of a group of Marxists with "recent positivism," the "latest realism," etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marx and Engels were partisans in philosophy from start to finish, they were able to detect the deviations from materialism and concessions to idealism and fideism in each and every "new" tendency. They therefore appraised Huxley <I>exclusively</I> from the standpoint of his materialist consistency. They therefore rebuked Feuerbach for not pursuing materialism to the end, for renouncing materialism because of the errors of individual materialists, for combating religion in order to renovate it or invent a new religion, for being un able, in sociology, to rid himself of idealist phraseology and become a materialist.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And whatever particular mistakes he committed in his exposition of dialectical materialism, J. Dietzgen fully appreciated and took over this great and most precious tradition of his teachers. Dietzgen sinned much by his clumsy deviations from materialism, but he never attempted to dissociate himself from it in principle, he never attempted to hoist a "new" standard and always at the decisive moment he firmly and categorically declared: I am a materialist; our philosophy is a materialist philosophy. "Of all parties," our Joseph Dietzgen justly said, "the middle party is the most repulsive. . . . Just as parties in politics are more and more becoming divided into two camps . . . so science too is being divided into two general classes (<I>Generalklassen </I>): metaphysicians on the one hand, and physicists, or materialists, on the other.* The intermediate elements and conciliatory quacks, with their various appellations -- spiritualists, sensationalists, realists, etc., etc. -- fall into the current on their way. We aim at definiteness and clarity. The reactionaries who sound a retreat (<I>Retraiteblaser </I>) call themselves idealists,** and materialists should be the name for all who are striving to liberate the human mind from the metaphysical spell. . . . If we compare the two parties respectively to solid and liquid, between them there is a mush."*** 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp

temptible <I>middle party</I> in philosophy, who confuse the materialist and idealist trends on every question. The attempt to escape these two basic trends in philosophy is nothing but "conciliatory quackery." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   J. Dietzgen had not the slightest doubt that the "scientific priestcraft" of idealist philosophy is simply the antechamber to open priestcraft. "Scientific priestcraft," he wrote, "is seriously endeavouring to assist religious priestcraft" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 51). "In particular, the sphere of epistemology, the misunderstanding of the human mind, is such a louse-hole" (<I>Lausgrube </I>) in which both kinds of priests "lay their eggs." "Graduated flunkeys," who with their talk of "ideal blessings" stultify the people by their tortuous (<I>geschraubte </I>) "idealism" (p. 53) -- that is J. Dietzgen's opinion of the professors of philosophy. "Just as the antipodes of the good God is the devil, so the professorial priest (<I>Kathederpfaffen </I>) has his opposite pole in the materialist." The materialist theory of knowledge is "a universal weapon against religious belief" (p. 55), and not only against the "notorious, formal and common religion of the priests, but also against the most refined, elevated professorial religion of muddled (<I>benebelter </I>) idealists" (p. 58). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Dietzgen was ready to prefer "religious honesty" to the "half-heartedness" of freethinking professors (p. 60), for "there at least there is a system," there we find integral people, people who do not separate theory from practice. For the Herr Professors "philosophy is not a science, but a means of defence against Social-Democracy . . ." (p. 107). "All who call themselves philosophers, professors, and university lecturers are, despite their apparent freethinking, more or less immersed in superstition and mysticism . . . and in relation to Social-Democracy constitute a single . . . 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 414</B></FONT><P>

reactionary mass" (p. 108). "Now, in order to follow the true path, without being led astray by all the religious and philosophical gibberish (<I>Welsch </I>), it is necessary to study the falsest of all false paths (<I>der Holzweg der Holzwege </I>), philosophy" (p. 103). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Let us now examine Mach, Avenarius and their school from the standpoint of parties in philosophy. Oh, these gentlemen <I>boast</I> of their <I>non-partisanship</I>, and if they have an antipodes, it is the <I>materialist</I> . . . and <I>only</I> the materialist. A red thread that runs through <I>all</I> the writings of <I>all</I> the Machians is the stupid claim to have "risen above" materialism and idealism, to have transcended this "obsolete" antithesis; but <I>in fact</I> the whole fraternity are <I>continually</I> sliding into idealism and are conducting a steady and incessant struggle against materialism. The subtle epistemological crotchets of a man like Avenarius are but professorial inventions, an attempt to form a small philosophical sect "of his own"; but, <I>as a matter of fact</I>, in the general circumstances of the struggle of ideas and trends in modern society, the <I>objective</I> part played by these epistemological artifices is in every case the same, namely, to clear the way for idealism and fideism, and to serve them faithfully. In fact, it cannot be an accident that the small school of empirio-criticists is acclaimed by the English spiritualists, like Ward, by the French neo-criticists, who praise Mach for his attack on materialism, and by the German immanentists! Dietzgen's expression, "graduated flunkeys of fideism," hits the nail on the head in the case of Mach, Avenarius and their whole school.* 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
* Here is another example of how the widespread currents of reactionary bourgeois philosophy make use of Machism in practice. Perhaps the "latest fashion" in the latest American philosophy is "pragmatism" [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 415. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] (from the Greek word "pragma" -- action; that is, a philosophy of action). The philosophical journals perhaps speak more of pragmatism than of anything else. Pragmatism ridicules the metaphysics both of idealism and materialism, acclaims expericnce and only experience, recognises practice as the only criterion, refers to the positivist movement in general, <I>especially turns for support to Ostwald</I>, <I>Mach</I>, <I>Pearson</I>, <I>Poincar&eacute</I> and <I>Duhem</I> for the belief that scicnce is not an "absolute copy of reality" and . . . succcssfully deduces from all this a God for practical purposes, and only for practical purposes, without any metaphysics, and without transcending the bounds of experience (<I>cf</I>. William James, Pragmatism. <I>A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking</I>, New York and London, [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 416. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] 1907, pp. 57 and 106 especially). From the standpoint of materialism the difference between Machism and pragmatism is as insignificant and unimportant as the difference between empirio-criticism and empirio-monism. Compare, for example, Bogdanov's definition of truth with the pragmatist definition of truth, which is: "Truth for a pragmatist becomes a class-name for all sorts of definite working values in expericnce" (<I>ibid</I>., p. 68).

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  It is the misfortune of the Russian Machians, who under took to "reconcile" Machism and Marxism, that they trusted the reactionary professors of philosophy and as a result slipped down an inclined plane. The methods of operation employed in the various attempts to develop and supplement Marx were not very ingenious. They read Ostwald, believe Ostwald, paraphrase Ostwald and call it Marxism. They read Mach, believe Mach, paraphrase Mach and call it Marxism. They read Poincar&eacute, believe Poincar&eacute, paraphrase Poincar&eacute and call it Marxism! <I>Not a single one</I> of these professors, who are capable of making very valuable contributions in the special fields of chemistry, history, or physics, <I>can be trusted one iota</I> when it comes to philosophy. Why? For the same reason that <I>not a single</I> professor of political economy, who may be capable of very valuable contributions in the field of factual and specialised investigations, can be trusted <I>one iota</I> when it comes to the general theory of political economy. For in modern society the latter is as much a <I>partisan</I> science as is <I>epistemology</I>. Taken as a whole, the professors of economics are nothing but learned salesmen of the capitalist class, while the professors of philosophy are learned salesmen of the theologians. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 416</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The task of Marxists in both cases is to be able to master and adapt the achievements of these "salesmen" (for instance, you will not make the slightest progress in the investigation of new economic phenomena unless you have recourse to the works of these salesmen) and <I>to be able</I> to lop off their reactionary tendency, to pursue your <I>own</I> line and to combat the <I>whole alignment</I> of forces and classes hostile to us. And this is just what our Machians were unable to do, they <I>slavishly</I> follow the lead of the reactionary professorial philosophy. "Perhaps we have gone astray, but we are seeking," wrote Lunacharsky in the name of the authors of the <I>Studies</I>. The trouble is that it is not <I>you</I> who are seeking, but you who are <I>being sought </I>! You do not go with your, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., Marxist (for you want to be Marxists), standpoint to every change in the bourgeois philosophical fashion; the fashion comes to you, foists upon you its new surrogates got up in the idealist taste, one day <I>&agrave la</I> Ostwald, the next day <I>&agrave la</I> Mach, and the day after <I>&agrave la</I> Poincar&eacute. These silly "theoretical" devices ("energetics," "elements," "introjections," etc.) in which you so na&iumlvely believe are confined to a narrow and tiny school, while the ideological and <I>social tendency</I> of these devices is immediately spotted by the Wards, the neo-criticists, the immanentists, the Lopatins and the pragmatists, and <I>it serves their purposes</I>. The infatuation for empirio-criticism and "physical" idealism passes as rapidly as the infatuation for Neo-Kantianism and "physio-

logical" idealism; but fideism takes its toll from every such infatuation and modihes its devices in a thousand ways for the benefit of philosophical idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The attitude towards religion and the attitude towards natural science excellently illustrate the <I>actual</I> class use made of empirio-criticism by bourgeois reactionaries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Take the first question. Do you think it is an accident that in a collective work directed <I>against</I> the philosophy of Marxism Lunacharsky went so far as to speak of the "deification of the higher human potentialities," of "religious atheism," etc.?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp417">*</A>]</FONT> If you do, it is only because the Russian Machians have not informed the public correctly regarding the <I>whole</I> Machian current in Europe and the attitude of this current to religion. Not only is this attitude in no way similar to the attitude of Marx, Engels, J. Dietzgen and even Feuerbach, but it is the <I>very opposite</I>, beginning with Petzoldt's statement to the effect that empirio-criticism "contradicts neither theism nor atheism" (<I>Einf&uumlhrung in die Philosophie der reinen Erfahrung</I>, Bd. I, S. 351), or Mach's declaration that "religious opinion is a private affair" (French trans., p. 434), and ending with the <I>explicit fideism</I>, the explicitly <I>arch-reactionary</I> views of Cornelius, who praises Mach and whom Mach praises, of Carus and of all the immanentists. The neutrality of a <I>philosopher</I> in this question <I>is in itself</I> servility to fideism, and Mach and Avenarius, because of the very premises of their epistemology, do not and cannot rise above neutrality.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Once you deny objective reality, given us in sensation, you have already lost every one of your weapons against fideism, for you have slipped into agnosticism or subjectivism -- and that is all fideism wants. If the perceptual world is objective reality, then the door is closed to every other "reality" or quasi-reality (remember that Bazarov believed the "realism" of the immanentists, who declare God to be a "real concept"). If the world is matter in motion, matter can and must be infinitely studied in the infinitely complex and detailed manifestations and ramifications of <I>this</I> motion, the motion of <I>this</I> matter; but beyond it, beyond the "physical," external world, with which everyone is familiar, there can be nothing. And the hostility to materialism and the showers of abuse heaped on the materialists are all in the order of things in civilised and democratic Europe. All this is going on to this day. All this is being <I>concealed</I> from the public by the Russian Machians, who have <I>not once</I> attempted even simply to compare the attacks made on materialism by Mach, Avenarius, Petzoldt and Co., with the statements made <I>in favour</I> of materialism by Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and J. Dietzgen. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But this "concealment" of the attitude of Mach and Avenarius to fideism will not avail. The facts speak for themselves. No efforts can release these reactionary professors from the pillory in which they have been placed by the kisses of Ward, the neo-criticists, Schuppe, Schubert-Soldern, Leclair, the pragmatists, etc. And the influence of the persons mentioned, as philosophers and professors, the popularity of their ideas among the "educated," <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the bourgeois, public and the specific literature they have created are ten times wider and richer than the particular little school of Mach and Avenarius. The little school serves those it 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 419</B></FONT><P>

should serve, and it is exploited as it deserves to be exploited. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The shameful things to which Lunacharsky has stooped are not exceptional; they are the product of empirio-criticism, both Russian and German. They cannot be defended on the grounds of the "good intentions" of the author, or the "special meaning" of his words; if it were the direct and common, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., the directly fideistic meaning, we should not stop to discuss matters with the author, for most likely not a single Marxist could be found in whose eyes such statements would <I>not</I> have placed Anatole Lunacharsky <I>exactly</I> in the same category as Peter Struve. If this is not the case (and it is not the case <I>yet </I>), it is exclusively because we perceive the "special" meaning and are <I>fighting while there is still ground</I> for a fight on comradely lines. This is just the disgrace of Lunacharsky's statements -- that he <I>could</I> connect them with his "good" intentions. This is just the evil of his "theory" -- that it permits the use of <I>such</I> methods or of <I>such</I> conclusions in the pursuit of good intentions. This is just the trouble -- that <I>at best</I> "good" intentions are the subjective affair of Tom, Dick or Harry, while the <I>social significance</I> of such statements is undeniable and indisputable, and no reservation or explanation can mitigate it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One must be blind not to see the ideological affinity beiween Lunacharsky's "deification of the higher human potentialities" and Bogdanov's "general substitution" of the psychical for all physical nature. This is one and the same thought; in the one case it is expressed principally from the aesthetic standpoint, and in the other from the epistemological standpoint. "Substitution," approaching the subject <I>taciitly</I> and from a different angle, <I>already deifies</I> the "higher human potentialities," by divorcing the "psychical" from man and by substituting an immensely extended, abstract, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 420</B></FONT><P>

divinely-lifeless "psychical in general" for <I>all physical nature</I>. And what of Yushkevich's "Logos" introduced into the "irrational stream of experience"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A single claw ensnared, and the bird is lost. And our Machians have all become ensnared in idealism, that is, in a diluted and subtle fideism; they became ensnared from the moment they took "sensation" not as an image of the external world but as a special "element." It is nobody's sensation, nobody's mind, nobody's spirit, nobody's will -- this is what one inevitably comes to if one does not recognise the materialist theory that the human mind <I>reflects</I> an objectively real external world.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Let us now examine the attitude of Machism, as a <I>philosophical current</I>, towards the natural sciences. All Machism, from beginning to end, <I>combats</I> the "metaphysics" of the natural sciences, this being the name they give to <I>natural-scientific materialism</I>, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., to the instinctive, unwitting, unformed, philosophically unconscious conviction shared by the overwhelming majority of scientists regarding the objective reality of the external world reflected by our consciousness. And our Machians maintain a skulking silence regarding this <I>fact</I> and obscure or confuse the <I>inseparable</I> connection between the instinctive materialism of the natural scientists and <I>philosophical materialism</I> as a trend, a trend known long ago and hundreds of times affirmed by Marx and Engels. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take Avenarius. In his very first work, <I>Philosophie als Denken der Welt gem&aumlss dem Prinzip des kleinsten Kraftmasses</I>, published in 1876, he attacked the metaphysics of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 421</B></FONT><P>

the natural sciences,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp421">*</A>]</FONT> <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., natural-scientific materialism, and, as he himself admitted in 1891 (without, however, "correcting" his views!), attacked it from the standpoint of epistemological idealism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take Mach. From 1872 (or even earlier) down to 1906 he waged continuous war on the metaphysics of natural science. However, he was conscientious enough to admit that his views were shared by "a number of philosophers" (the immanentists included), but by "<I>very few</I> scientists" (<I>Analysis of Sensations</I>, p. 9). In 1906 Mach also honestly admitted that the "majority of scientists adhere to materialism" (<I>Erkenntnis und Irrtum</I>, 2. Aufl., S. 4). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take Petzoldt. In 1900 he proclaimed that the "natural sciences are thoroughly (<I>ganz und gar </I>) imbued with metaphysics." "Their 'experience' has still to be purified" (<I>Einf&uumlhrung in die Philosophie der reinen Erfahrung</I>, Bd. I, S. 343). We know that Avenarius and Petzoldt "purify" experience of all recognition of the objective reality given us in sensation. In 1904 Petzoldt declared: "The mechanical world outlook of the modern scientist is essentially no better than that of the ancient Indians. . . . It makes no difference whether the world rests on a mythical elephant or on just as mythical a swarm of molecules and atoms epistemologically thought of as real and therefore not used merely metaphorically (<I>bloss bildlich </I>)" (Bd. II, S. 176). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take Willy, the only Machian decent enough to be ashamed of his kinship with the immanentists. Yet, in 1905 he too declared: ". . . The natural sciences, after all, are also in many respects an authority of which we must rid ourselves" (<I>Gegen die Schulweisheit</I>, S. 158).

  But this is all <I>sheer obscurantism</I>, out-and-out reaction. To regard atoms, molecules, electrons, etc., as an approximately true reflection in our mind of the <I>objectively real movement of matter</I> is equivalent to believing in an elephant upon which the world rests! No wonder that this <I>obscurantist</I>, decked in the cap and bells of fashionable positivism, was greeted by the immanentists <I>with open arms</I>. There is <I>not a single</I> immanentist who would not furiously attack the "metaphysics" of science, the "materialism" of the scientists, <I>precisely because of the recognition</I> by the scientists of the objective reality of matter (and its particles), time, space, laws of nature, etc., etc. Long before the new discoveries in physics which gave rise to "physical idealism" were made, Leclair, using Mach as a support, combated "The Predominant Materialist Trend (<I>Grundzug </I>) of Modern Science" (the title of &#167; 6 of <I>Der Realismus usw</I>., 1879), Schubert-Soldern fought "The Metaphysics of Natural Science" (the title of Chapter II of <I>Grundlagen einer Erkenntnistheorie</I>, 1884) Rehmke battled with natural-scientific "materialism," that "<I>metaphysics of the street </I>" (<I>Philosophie und Kantianismus</I>, 1882, S. 17), etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And the immanentists quite legitimately drew <I>direct and outspoken</I> fideist conclusions from this <I>Machian</I> idea of the "metaphysical character" of natural-scientific materialism. If natural science in its theories depicts not objective reality, but <I>only</I> metaphors, symbols, forms of human experience etc., it is beyond dispute that humanity is entitled to create for itself in another sphere <I>no less</I> "<I>real</I> concepts," such as God, and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The philosophy of the scientist Mach is to science what the kiss of the Christian Judas was to Christ. Mach likewise betrays science into the hands of fideism by virtually 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 423</B></FONT><P>

deserting to the camp of philosophical idealism. Mach's renunciation of natural-scientific materialism is a reactionary phenomenon in every respect. We saw this quite clearly when we spoke of the struggle of the "physical idealists" against the <I>majority</I> of scientists, who continue to maintain the standpoint of the old philosophy. We shall see it still more clearly if we compare the eminent scientist, Ernst Haeckel, with the eminent (among the reactionary philistines) philosopher, Ernst Mach. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The storm provoked by Ernst Haeckel's <I>The Riddle of the Universe</I> in every civilised country strikingly brought out, on the one hand, the <I>partisan character</I> of philosophy in modern society and, on the other, the true social significance of the struggle of materialism against idealism and agnosticism. The fact that the book was sold in <I>hundreds of thousands</I> of copies, that it was immediately translated into all languages and that it appeared in specially cheap editions, clearly demonstrates that the book "has found its way to the masses," that there are multitudes of readers whom Ernst Haeckel at once won over to his side. This popular little book became a weapon in the class struggle. The professors of philosophy and theology in every country of the world set about denouncing and annihilating Haeckel in every possible way. The eminent English physicist Lodge hastened to defend God against Haeckel. The Russian physicist Mr. Chwolson went to Germany to publish a vile reactionary pamphlet attacking Haeckel and to assure the respectable philistines that not all scientists now hold the position of "na&iumlve realism."* There is no counting the

theologians who joined the campaign against Haeckel. There was no abuse not showered on him by the official professors of philosophy.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp424">*</A>]</FONT> It was amusing to see how -- perhaps for the first time in their lives -- the eyes of these mummies, dried and shrunken in the atmosphere of lifeless scholasticism, began to gleam and their cheeks to glow under the slaps which Haeckel administered them. The high-priests of pure science, and, it would appear, of the most abstract theory, fairly groaned with rage. And throughout all the howling of the philosophical diehards (the idealist Paulsen, the immanentist Rehmke, the Kantian Adickes, and the others whose name, god wot, is legion) one underlying motif is clearly discernible: they are all against the "<I>metaphysics </I>" of science, against "dogmatism," against "the exaggeration of the value and significance of science," against "natural-scientific <I>materialism</I>." He is a materialist -- at him! at the materialist! He is deceiving the public by not calling him self a materialist directly! -- that is what particularly incenses the worthy professors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And the noteworthy thing in all this tragi-comedy** is the fact that Haeckel himself <I>renounces materialism</I> and rejects the appellation. What is more, far from rejecting religion altogether, he has invented his own religion (something like

* The pamphlet of Heinrich Schmidt, <I>Der Kempf und die Weltr&aumltsel</I> [<I>The Fight over "The Riddle of the Universe </I>"] (Bonn, 1900), gives a fairly good picture of the campaign launched against Haeckel by the professors of philosophy and theology. But this pamphlet is already very much out-of-date.<BR> 
&nbsp &nbsp 
** The tragic element was introduced by the attempt made on Haeckel's life this spring (1908). After Haeckel had received a number of anonymous letters addressing him by such epithets as "dog," "atheist," "monkey," and so forth, some true German soul threw a stone of no mean size through the window of Haeckel's study in Jena.

Bulgakov's "atheistic faith" or Lunacharsky's "religious atheism"), and on grounds of <I>principle</I> advocates a union of religion and science. What then is it all about? What "fatal misunderstanding" started the row? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The point is that Haeckel's philosophical na&iumlvete, his lack of definite partisan aims, his anxiety to respect the prevailing philistine prejudice against materialism, his personal conciliatory tendencies and proposals concerning religion, all this gave the greater salience to <I>the general spirit</I> of his book, the <I>ineradicability</I> of natural-scientific materialism and its <I>irreconcilability</I> with <I>all</I> official professorial philosophy and theology. Haeckel personally does not seek a rupture with the philistines, but what he expounds with such un shakably na&iumlve conviction is <I>absolutely</I> incompatible with any of the shades of prevailing philosophical idealism. All these shades, from the crudest reactionary theories of a Hartmann, to Petzoldt, who fancies himself the latest, most progressive and advanced of the positivists, and the empirio-criticist Mach -- <I>all</I> are agreed that natural-scientific materialism is "metaphysics," that the recognition of an objective reality underlying the theories and conclusions of science is sheer "na&iumlve realism," etc. And for this doctrine, "sacred" to <I>all</I> professorial philosophy and theology, every page of Haeckel is a <I>slap in the face</I>. This scientist, who undoubtedly expressed the very firmly implanted, although unformed opinions, sentiments and tendencics of the overwhelming majority of the scientists of the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, instantly, easily and simply revealed what professorial philosophy tried to conceal from the public and from itself, namely, the fact that there is a foundation, growing ever wider and firmer, which 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 426</B></FONT><P>

shatters all the efforts and strivings of the thousand and one little schools of philosophical idealism, positivism, realism, empirio-criticism and other confusionism. This foundation is <I>natural-scientific materialism</I>. The conviction of the "na&iumlve realists" (in other words, of all humanity) that our sensations are images of an objectively real external world is the conviction of the mass of scientists, one that is steadily growing and gaining in strength. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The cause of the founders of new philosophical schools and of the inventors of new epistemological "isms" is lost, irrevocably and hopelessly. They may flounder about in their "original" petty systems; they may strive to engage the attention of a few admirers in the interesting controversy as to who was the first to exclaim, "Eh!" -- the empirio-critical Bobchinsky,<A NAME="p426"> or the empirio-monistic Dobchinsky;<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#en127">127</A>]</FONT> they may even devote themselves to creating an extensive "special" literature, like the "immanentists." But the course of development of science, despite its vacillations and hesitations, despite the unwitting character of the materialism of the scientists, despite yesterday's infatuation with fashionable "physiological idealism" or today's infatuation with fashionable "physical idealism," is <I>sweeping aside</I> all the petty systems and artifices and once again bringing to the forefront the "metaphysics" of <I>natural-scientific materialism</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Here is an illustration of this from Haeckel. In his <I>The Wonders of Life</I>, Haeckel compares the monistic and dualistic theories of knowledge. We give the most interesting points of the comparison:*

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This typical quotation from his works shows that Haeckel does not attempt an analysis of philosophical problems and

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 428</B></FONT><P>

is not able to contrast the materialist theory of knowledge with the idealist theory of knowledge. He <I>ridicules all</I> idealist -- more broadly, all peculiarly philosophical -- artifices from the standpoint of natural science, <I>without even permitting the idea</I> that any other theory of knowledge but <I>natural-scientific materialism</I> is possible. He ridicules the philosophers from the standpoint of a materialist, <I>without himself realising</I> that his standpoint is that of a materialist! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The impotent wrath aroused in the philosophers by this almighty materialism is comprehensible. We quoted above the opinion of the "true-Russian" Lopatin. And here is the opinion of Mr. Rudolf Willy, the most progressive of the "empirio-criticists," who is irreconcilably hostile to idealism (don't laugh!). "Haeckel's monism is a very heterogeneous mixture: it unites certain natural-scientific laws, such as the law of the conservation of energy . . . with certain scholastic traditions about substance and the thing-in-itself into a chaotic jumble" (<I>Gegen die Schulweisheit</I>, S. 128). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What has annoyed this most worthy "recent positivist"? Well, how could he help being annoyed when he immediately realised that from Haeckel's standpoint all the great doctrines of his teacher Avenarius -- for instance, that the brain is not the organ of thought, that sensations are not images of the external world, that matter ("substance") or "the thing-in-itself" is not an objective reality, and so forth -- are nothing but <I>sheer idealist gibberish </I>!? Haeckel did not say it in so many words because he did not concern himself with philosophy and was not acquainted with "empirio-criticism" <I>as such</I>. But Rudolf Willy could not help realising that a hundred thousand Haeckel readers meant as many people spitting in the face of the <I>philosophy</I> of Mach 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 429</B></FONT><P>

and Avenarius. Willy wipes his face in advance, <I>in the Lopatin manner</I>. For the <I>essence</I> of the arguments which Mr. Lopatin and Mr. Willy marshal against materialism in general and natural-scientific materialism in particular, is exactly the same in both. To us Marxists the difference between Mr. Lopatin and Messrs. Willy, Petzoldt, Mach and Co. is no greater than the difference between the Protestant theologians and the Catholic theologians. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "war" on Haeckel <I>has proven</I> that this view of ours corresponds to <I>objective reality</I>, <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>., to the class nature of modern society and its class ideological tendencies. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is another little example. The Machian Kleinpeter has translated from English into German, under the title of <I>Das Weltbild der modernen Naturwissenschaft</I> [<I>World Picture from the Standpoint of Modern Natural Science </I>] (Leipzig, 1905), a work by Carl Snyder well known in America. This work gives a clear and popular account of a number of recent discoveries in physics and other branches of science. And the Machian Kleinpeter felt himself called upon to supply the book with a preface in which he makes certain <I>reservations</I>, such as, for example, that Snyder's epistemology is "not satisfactory" (p. v). Why so? Because Snyder never entertains the slightest doubt that the world picture is a picture of how matter moves and of how "<I>matter thinks </I>" (p. 228). In his next book, <I>The World Machine</I> (London and New York, 1907), Snyder, referring to the fact that his book is dedicated to the memory of Democritus of Abdera, who lived about 460-360 B.C., says: "Democritus has often been styled the grandsire of materialism. It is a school of philosophy that is a little out of fashion nowadays; yet it is worthy of note that practically all of the modern 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 430</B></FONT><P>

advance in our ideas of this world has been grounded upon his conceptions. Practically speaking, materialistic assumptions are simply <I>unescapable</I> in physical investigations" (p. 140). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  ". . . If he like, he may dream with good Bishop Berkeley that it is all a dream. Yet comforting as may be the leger-demain of an idealised idealism, there are still few among us who, whatever they may think regarding the problem of the external world, doubt that they themselves exist; and it needs no long pursuit of the will-o'-the-wisps of the <I>Ich</I> and <I>non-Ich</I> to assure oneself that if in an unguarded moment we assume that we ourselves have a personality and a being, we let in the whole procession of appearances which come of the six gates of the senses. The nebular hypothesis, the light-bearing ether, the atomic theory, and all their like, may be but convenient 'working hypotheses,' but it is well to remember that, in the absence of negative proof, they stand on more or less the same footing as the hypothesis that a being you call 'you,' Oh, Indulgent Reader, scans these lines" (pp. 31-32). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Imagine the bitter lot of a Machian when his favourite subtle constructions, which reduce the categories of science to mere working hypotheses, are laughed at by the scientists on both sides of the ocean as sheer nonsense! Is it to be wondered that Rudolf Willy, <I>in 1905</I>, combats Democritus as though he were a living enemy, thereby providing an excellent illustration of the <I>partisan character of philosophy</I> and once more exposing the real position he himself takes up in this partisan struggle? He writes: "Of course, Democritus was not conscious of the fact that atoms and the void are only fictitious concepts which perform mere accessory services (<I>blosse Handlangerdienste </I>), and maintain their 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 431</B></FONT><P>

existence only by grace of expediency, just as long as they prove useful. Democritus was not free enough for this; but neither are our modern natural scientists, with few exceptions. The faith of old Democritus is the faith of our scientists" (<I>op</I>. <I>cit</I>., p. 57). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And there is good reason for despair! The "empirio-criticists" have proven in quite a "new way" that both space and atoms are "working hypotheses"; and yet the natural scientists deride this <I>Berkeleianism</I> and follow Haeckel. We are by no means idealists, this is a slander; we are only striving (together with the idealists) to refute the epistemological line of Democritus; we have been striving to do so for more than 2,000 years, but all in vain! And nothing better remains for our leader Ernst Mach to do than to dedicate his last work, the outcome of his life and philosophy, <I>Erkenntnis und Irrtum</I>, to <I>Wilhelm Schuppe</I> and to remark ruefully in the text that the majority of scientists are materialists and that "we also" <I>sympathise</I> with Haeckel . . . for his "freethinking" (p. 14). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And there he completely betrays himself, this ideologist of reactionary philistinism who follows the arch-reactionary Schuppe and "<I>sympathises </I>" with Haeckel's freethinking. They are all like this, these humanitarian philistines in Europe, with their freedom-loving sympathies and their ideological (political and economic) captivity to the Wilhelm Schuppes.* Non-partisanship in philosophy is only wretchedly masked servility to idealism and fideism.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us, in conclusion, compare this with the opinion of Haeckel held by Franz Mehring, who not only wants to be, but who knows how to be a Marxist. The moment <I>The Riddle of the Universe</I> appeared, towards the end of 1899, Mehring pointed out that "Haeckel's work, both in its less good and its very good aspects, is eminently adapted to help clarify the apparently rather confused views prevailing in the party as to the significance for it of <I>historical</I> materialism, on the one hand, and historical <I>materialism</I>, on the other."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MEC08-old.html#fnp432">*</A>]</FONT> Haeckel's defect is that he has not the slightest conception of <I>historical</I> materialism, which leads him to utter the most woeful nonsense about politics, about "monistic religion," and so on and so forth. "Haeckel is a materialist and monist, not a <I>historical</I> but a natural-scientific materialist" (<I>ibid</I>.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "He who wants to perceive this inability [of natural-scientific materialism to deal with social problems] tangibly, he who wants to be convinced that natural-scientific materialism must be broadened into historical materialism if it is really to be an invincible weapon in the great struggle for the liberation of mankind, let him read Haeckel's book. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "But let him not read it for this purpose alone! Its uncommonly weak side is inseparably bound up with its uncommonly strong side, <I>viz</I>., with the comprehensible and luminous description (which after all takes up by far the greater and more important part of the book) given by Haeckel of the development of the natural sciences in this [the 19th] century, or, in other words, of the <I>triumphant march of natural-scientific materialism</I>."**

                                                  CONCLUSION
</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There are four standpoints from which a Marxist must proceed to form a judgment of empirio-criticism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   First and foremost, the theoretical foundations of this philosophy must be compared with those of dialectical materialism. Such a comparison, to which the first three chapters were devoted, reveals, <I>along the whole line</I> of epistemological problems, the <I>thoroughly reactionary</I> character of empirio-criticism, which uses new artifices, terms and subtleties to disguise the old errors of <I>idealism and agnosticism</I>. Only utter ignorance of the nature of philosophical materialism generally and of the nature of Marx's and Engels' dialectical method can lead one to speak of "combining" empirio-criticism and Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Secondly, the place of empirio-criticism, as one very small school of specialists in philosophy, in relation to the other modern schools of philosophy must be determined. Both Mach and Avenarius started with Kant and, leaving him, proceeded not towards materialism, but in the opposite direction, towards Hume and Berkeley. Imagining that he was "purifying experience" generally, Avenarius was in fact 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 434</B></FONT><P>

only purifying agnosticism of Kantianism. The whole school of Mach and Avenarius is moving more and more definitely towards idealism, hand in hand with one of the most reactionary of the idealist schools, <I>viz</I>., the so-called immanentists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thirdly, the indubitable connection between Machism and one school in one branch of modern science must be borne in mind. The vast majority of scientists, both generally and in this special branch of science in question, <I>viz</I>., physics, are invariably on the side of materialism. A minority of new physicists, however, influenced by the breakdown of old theories brought about by the great discoveries of recent years, influenced by the crisis in the new physics, which has very clearly revealed the relativity of our knowledge, have, owing to their ignorance of dialectics, slipped into idealism by way of relativism. The physical idealism in vogue today is as reactionary and transitory an infatuation as was the fashionable physiological idealism of the recent past. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Fourthly, behind the epistemological scholasticism of empirio-criticism one must not fail to see the struggle of parties in philosophy, a struggle which in the last analysis reflects the tendencies and ideology of the antagonistic classes in modern society. Recent philosophy is as partisan as was philosophy two thousand years ago. The contending parties are essentially, although it is concealed by a pseudo-erudite quackery of new terms or by a feeble-minded non-partisanship, materialism and idealism. The latter is merely a subtle, refined form of fideism, which stands fully armed, commands vast organisations and steadily continues to exercise influence on the masses, turning the slightest vacillation in philosophical thought to its own advantage. The objective, class role of empirio-criticism consists entirely in 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 435</B></FONT><P>

rendering faithful service to the fideists in their struggle against materialism in general and historical materialism in particular.

                                          CRITICISE KANTIANISM?
</B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In the first section of Chapter IV we showed in detail that the materialists have been criticising Kant from a standpoint diametrically opposite to that from which Mach and Avenarius criticise him. It would not be superfluous to add here, albeit briefly, an indication of the epistemological position held by the great Russian Hegelian and materialist, N. G. Chernyshevsky. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Shortly after Albrecht Rau, the German disciple of Feuerbach, had published his criticism of Kant, the great Russian writer N. G. Chernyshevsky, who was also a disciple of Feuerbach, first attempted an explicit statement of his attitude towards both Feuerbach and Kant. N. G. Chernyshevsky had appeared in Russian literature as a follower of Feuerbach as early as the 'fifties, but our censorship did not allow him even to mention Feuerbach's name. In 1888, in the preface to the projected third edition of his <I>The Aesthetic Relation of Art to Reality</I>, N. G. Chernyshevsky attempted 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 437</B></FONT><P>

to allude directly to Feuerbach, but in 1888 too the censor refused to allow even a mere reference to Feuerbach! It was not until 1906 that the preface saw the light (see N. G. Chernyshevsky, <I>Collected Works</I>, Vol. X, Part II, pp. 190-97). In this preface N. G. Chernyshevsky devotes half a page to criticising Kant and the scientists who follow Kant in their philosophical conclusions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is the excellent argument given by Chernyshevsky in 1888: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Natural scientists who imagine themselves to be builders of all-embracing theories are really disciples, and usually poor disciples, of the ancient thinkers who evolved the metaphysical systems, usually thinkers whose systems had already been partially destroyed by Schelling and finally destroyed by Hegel. One need only point out that the majority of the natural scientists who endeavour to construct broad theories of the laws of operation of human thought only repeat Kant's metaphysical theory regarding the subjectivity of our knowledge. . . ." (For the benefit of the Russian Machians who manage to muddle everything, let us say that Chernyshevsky is below Engels in so far as in his terminology he confuses the opposition between materialism and idealism with the opposition between metaphysical thought and dialectical thought; but Chernyshevsky is entirely on Engels' level in so far as he takes Kant to task not for realism, but for agnosticism and subjectivism, not for recognition of the "thing-in-itself," but for inability to derive our knowledge from this objective source.) ". . . they argue from Kant's words that the forms of our sense-perception have no resemblance to the forms of the actual existence of objects. . . ." (For the benefit of the Russian Machians who manage to muddle everything, let us say that Chernyshevsky's criticism 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 438</B></FONT><P>

of Kant is the diametrical opposite of the criticism of Kant by Avenarius, Mach and the immanentists, because for Chernyshevsky, as for every materialist, the forms of our sense-perception do resemble the form of the actual -- <I>i</I>.<I>e</I>. objectively-real -- existence of objects.) " . . . that, therefore, really existing objects, their real qualities, and the real relations between them are unknowable to us. . . ." (For the benefit of the Russian Machians who manage to muddle everything, let us say that for Chernyshevsky, as for every materialist, objects, or to use Kant's ornate language, "things-in-themselves," <I>really</I> exist and are <I>fully</I> knowable to us, knowable in their existence, their qualities and the real relations between them.) " . . . and if they were knowable they could not be the object of our thought, which shapes all the material of knowledge into forms totally different from the forms of actual existence, that, moreover, the very laws of thought have only a subjective significance. . . ." (For the benefit of the Machian muddlers, let us say that for Chernyshevsky, as for every materialist, the laws of thought have not merely a subjective significance; in other words, the laws of thought reflect the forms of actual existence of objects, fully resemble, and do not differ from, these forms.) " . . . that in reality there is nothing corresponding to what appears to us to be the connection of cause and effect, for there is neither antecedent nor subsequent, neither whole nor parts, and so on and so forth. . . ." (For the benefit of the Machian muddlers, let us say that for Chernyshevsky, as for every materialist, there does exist in reality what appears to us to be the connection between cause and effect, there is objective causality or natural necessity.) ". . . When natural scientists stop uttering such and similar metaphysical nonsense, they will be capable of working out, and probably 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 439</B></FONT><P>

will work out, on the basis of science, a system of concepts more exact and complete than those propounded by Feuerbach. . . ." (For the benefit of the Machian muddlers, let us say that Chernyshevsky regards as metaphysical nonsense <I>all</I> deviations from materialism, both in the direction of idealism and in the direction of agnosticism.) ". . . But meanwhile, the best statement of the scientific concepts of the so-called fundamental problems of man's inquisitiveness remains that made by Feuerbach" (pp. 195-96). By the fundamental problems of man's inquisitiveness Chernyshevsky means what in modern language are known as the fundamental problems of the theory of knowledge, or epistemology. Chernyshevsky is the only really great Russian writer who, from the 'fifties until 1888, was able to keep on the level of an integral philosophical materialism and who spurned the wretched nonsense of the Neo-Kantians, positivists, Machians and other muddleheads. But Chernyshevsky did not succced in rising, or, rather, owing to the backwardness of Russian life, was unable to rise, to the level of the dialectical materialism of Marx and Engels.

   Lenin began the writing of <I>Materialism and Empirio-Criticism</I> in Geneva, February 1908. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    In May of that year he went to London, where he spent about a month in the library of the British Museum working on material not available in Geneva. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The manuscript was completed in October 1908 and was forwarded to a secret address in Moscow, where the Zveno Publishing House under took its printing. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 441</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The proofs were read by Lenin's sister, A. I. Elizarova, in Moscow, then one set was sent abroad to Lenin who thoroughly checked them, noted printing errors and made a number of corrections. Part of the corrections were incorporated in the printed text; others were indicated in an important list of errata appended to the first edition of the book. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Lenin had to consent to tone down some passages in the book to avoid giving the tsarist censors excuse for proscribing its publication. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Lenin insisted that the book be brought out quickly, urging that this was necessitated "not only by literary, but also by serious political considerations". 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The book appeared in an edition of 2,000 copies in May 1909.

   <I>Fideism</I> -- Lenin originally used the term <I>popovshchina</I> (priest-lore, clericalism) in his manuscript but replaced it with "fideism" to avoid the censorship. Lenin explained the term "fideism" in a letter of November 8, 1908 (New Style), to A. I. Elizarova (V. I. Lenin, <I>Works</I>, 4th Russ. ed., Vol. 37, p. 316).

   Lenin is referring to so-called "god-building", an anti-Marxist religious-philosophical literary trend which arose in the Stolypin reaction period among a section of the Party intellectuals, who later deviated from Marxism after the defeat of the 1905-07 revolution. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    The "god-builders" (A. V. Lunacharsky, V. Bazarov and others) advocated the founding of a new "socialist" religion with the aim of reconciling Marxism with religion. Maxim Gorky was at one time associated with this group. A conference of the enlarged editorial board of <I>Proletary</I> (1909) condemned the "god-building" trend and declared in a special resolution that the Bolshevik faction had nothing in common with "such distortions of scientific socialism". 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    Lenin exposed the reactionary nature of "god-building" in <I>Materialism and Empirio-Criticism</I> and in his letters to Gorky of February-April 1908 and November-December 1913.

   It can be seen from Lenin's letter, December 19, 1908 (New Style), to A. I. Elizarova that the original manuscript read: "Lunacharsky even 'mentally projected' for himself a god." The phrase was modified to avoid the censor's axe. In the letter Lenin wrote: "'Mentally projected for himself a god' will have to be changed to mentally projected for himself -- well, to use a mild expression -- religious conceptions, or something of that nature" (V. I. Lenin, <I>Works</I>, 4th Russ. ed., Vol. 37, p. 324).

   The manuscript of the "Supplement to Chapter Four, Section I[,] From What Angle Did N. G. Chernyshevsky Criticise Kantianism?" was sent to A. I. Elizarova in the latter part of March 1909, when the book had already gone to press. In a letter to her of March 23 or 24, 1909 (New Style), Lenin wrote: "I am sending a supplement. It is not worth holding up the book for it, but if there is still time, print it at the end of the book, after the 'Conclusion', in special type -- nonpareil, for example. I consider it highly important to contrast Chernyshevsky to the Machians."
