  One of the most vicious and probably most widespread distortions of Marxism resorted to by the<A NAME="p22"> dominant "socialist" parties is the opportunist lie that preparation for insurrection, and generally the treatment of insurrection as an art, is "Blanquism".<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MI17.html#en7">7</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Bernstein, the leader of opportunism, has already earned himself unfortunate fame by accusing Marxism of Blanquism, and when our present-day opportunists cry Blanquism they do not improve on or "enrich" the meagre "ideas" of Bernstein one little bit. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Marxists are accused of Blanquism for treating insurrection as an art! Can there be a more flagrant perversion of the truth, when not a single Marxist will deny that it was Marx who expressed himself on this score in the most definite, precise and categorical manner, referring to insurrection specifically as an <I>art</I>, saying that it must be treated as an art, that you must <I>win</I> the first success and then proceed from success to success, never ceasing the <I>offensive</I> against the' enemy, taking advantage of his confusion, etc., etc.? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To be successful, insurrection must rely not upon conspiracy and not upon a party, but upon the advanced class. That is the first point. Insurrection must rely upon a <I>revolutionary upsurge of the people</I>. That is the second point. Insurrection must rely upon that <I>turning-point</I> in the history of the growing revolution when the activity of the advanced ranks of the people is at its height, and when the <I>vacillations</I> in the ranks of the enemy and <I>in the ranks</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 23</B></FONT><P>

<I>of the weak</I>, <I>half-hearted and irresolute friends of the revolution</I> are strongest. That is the third point. And these three conditions for raising the question of insurrection distinguish <I>Marxism from Blanquism</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Once these conditions exist, however, to refuse to treat insurrection as an art is a betrayal of Marxism and a betrayal of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To show that it is precisely the present moment that the Party <I>must</I> recognise as the one in which the entire course of events has objectively placed <I>insurrection</I> on the order of the day and that insurrection must be treated as an art,<A NAME="p23"> it will perhaps be best to use the method of comparison, and to draw a parallel between July 3-4<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MI17.html#en8">8</A>]</FONT> and the September days. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   On July 3-4 it could have been argued, without violating the truth, that the correct thing to do was to take power, for our enemies would in any case have accused us of insurrection and ruthlessly treated us as rebels. However, to have decided on this account in favour of taking power at that time would have been wrong, because the objective conditions for the victory of the insurrection did not exist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (1)&nbsp;We still lacked the support of the class which is the vanguard of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We still did not have a majority among the workers and soldiers of Petrograd and Moscow. Now we have a majority in both Soviets. It was created <I>solely</I> by the history of July and August, by the experience of the "ruthless treatment"<A NAME="p23a"> meted out to the Bolsheviks, and by the experience of the Kornilov revolt.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MI17.html#en9">9</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (2)&nbsp;There was no country-wide revolutionary upsurge at that time. There is now, after the Kornilov revolt; the situation in the provinces and assumption of power by the Soviets in many localities prove this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (3)&nbsp;At that time there was no <I>vacillation</I> on any serious political scale among our enemies and among the irresolute petty bourgeoisie. Now the vacillation is enormous. Our main enemy, Allied and world imperialism (for world imperialism is headed by the "Allies"), <I>has begun to waver</I> between a war to a victorious finish and a separate peace directed against Russia. Our petty-bourgeois democrats, having clearly lost their majority among the people, have 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 24</B></FONT><P><A NAME="p24">

begun to vacillate enormously, and have rejected a bloc, i.e., a coalition, with the Cadets.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MI17.html#en10">10</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (4)&nbsp;Therefore, an insurrection on July 3-4 would have been a mistake; we could not have retained power either physically or politically. We could not have retained it physically even though Petrograd was at times in our hands, because at that time our workers and soldiers would not have <I>fought and died</I> for Petrograd. There was not at the time that "savageness", or fierce hatred <I>both</I> of the Kerenskys and of the Tseretelis and Chernovs. Our people had still not been tempered by the experience of the persecution of the Bolsheviks in which the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks participated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We could not have retained power politically on July 3-4 because, <I>before the Kornilov revolt</I>, the army and the provinces could and would have marched against Petrograd. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Now the picture is entirely different. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have the following of the majority of a <I>class</I>, the vanguard of the revolution, the vanguard of the people, which is capable of carrying the masses with it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have the following of the <I>majority</I> of the people, because Chernov's resignation, while by no means the only symptom, is the most striking and obvious symptom that the peasants <I>will not receive land</I> from the Socialist-Revolutionaries' bloc (or from the Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves). And that is the chief reason for the popular character of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are in the advantageous position of a party that knows for certain which way to go at a lime when <I>imperialism as a whole</I> and the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary bloc as a whole are vacillating in an incredible fashion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Our victory is assured</I>, for the people are close to desperation, and we are showing the entire people a sure way out; we demonstrated to the entire people during the "Kornilov days" the value of our leadership, and then <I>proposed</I> to the politicians of the bloc a compromise, <I>which they rejected</I>, although there is no let-up in their vacillations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It would be a great mistake to think that our offer of a compromise had not <I>yet</I> been rejected, and that the Democratic Conference may <I>still</I> accept it. The compromise 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 25</B></FONT><P>

was proposed by a <I>party</I> to <I>parties </I>; it could not have been proposed in any other way. It was rejected by <I>parties</I>. The Democratic Conference is a <I>conference</I>, and nothing more. One thing must not be forgotten, namely, that the <I>majority</I> of the revolutionary people, the poor, embittered peasants, are not represented in it. It is a conference of <I>a minority of the people</I> -- this obvious truth must not be forgotten. It would be a big mistake, sheer parliamentary cretinism on our part, if we were to regard the Democratic Conference as a parliament; for even <I>if it were</I> to proclaim itself a permanent and sovereign parliament of the revolution, it would nevertheless <I>decide nothing</I>. The power of decision lies <I>outside</I> it in the working-class quarters of Petrograd and Moscow. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All the objective conditions exist for a successful insurrection. We have the exceptional advantage of a situation in which <I>only</I> our victory in the insurrection can put an end to that most painful thing on earth, vacillation, which has worn the people out; in which only our victory in the insurrection will give the peasants land immediately; a situation in which <I>only our</I> victory in the insurrection can <I>foil</I> the game of a separate peace directed against the revolution -- foil it by publicly proposing a fuller, juster and earlier peace, a peace that will <I>benefit</I> the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Finally, our Party alone <I>can</I>, by a victorious insurrection, save Petrograd; for if our proposal for peace is rejected, if we do not secure even an armistice, then we shall become "defencists", we shall place ourselves <I>at the head of the war parties</I>, we shall be the <I>war party par excellence</I>, and we shall conduct the war in a truly revolutionary manner. We shall take away all the bread and boots from the capitalists. We shall leave them only crusts and dress them in bast shoes. We shall send all the bread and footwear to the front. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And then we shall save Petrograd. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The resources, both material and spiritual, for a truly revolutionary war in Russia are still immense; the chances are a hundred to one that the Germans will grant us at least an armistice. And to secure an armistice now would in itself mean to win the <I>whole world</I>.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Having recognised the absolute necessity for an insurrection of the workers of Petrograd and Moscow in order to save the revolution and to save Russia from a "separate" partition by the imperialists of both groups, we must first adapt our political tactics at the Conference to the conditions of the growing insurrection; secondly, we must show that it is not only in words that we accept Marx's idea that insurrection must be treated as an art. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the Conference we must immediately cement the Bolshevik group, without striving after numbers, and without fearing to leave the waverers in the waverers' camp. They are more useful to the cause of the revolution <I>there</I> than in the camp of the resolute and devoted fighters. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must draw up a brief declaration from the Bolsheviks, emphasising in no uncertain manner the irrelevance of long speeches and of "speeches" in general, the necessity for immediate action to save the revolution, the absolute necessity for a complete break with the bourgeoisie, for the removal of the present government, in its entirety, for a complete rupture with the Anglo-French imperialists, who are preparing a "separate" partition of Russia, and for the immediate transfer of all power to <I>revolutionary democrats</I>, <I>headed by the revolutionary proletariat</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our declaration must give the briefest and most trenchant formulation of this conclusion in connection with the programme proposals of peace for the peoples, land for the peasants, confiscation of scandalous profits, and a check on the scandalous sabotage of production by the capitalists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The briefer and more trenchant the declaration, the better. Only two other highly important points must be clearly indicated in it, namely, that the people are worn out by the vacillations, that they are fed up with the irresolution of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks; and that we are definitely breaking with these <I>parties</I> because they have betrayed the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And another thing. By immediately proposing a peace without annexations, by immediately breaking with the Allied imperialists and with all imperialists, either we shall at once obtain an armistice, or the entire revolutionary 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 27</B></FONT><P>

proletariat will rally to the defence of the country, and a really just, really revolutionary war will then be waged by revolutionary democrats under the leadership of the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Having read this declaration, and having appealed for <I>decisions</I> and not talk, for <I>action</I> and not resolution-writing, we must <I>dispatch</I> our entire group to the <I>factories and the barracks</I>. Their place is there, the pulse of life is there, there is the source of salvation for our revolution, and there is the motive force of the Democratic Conference. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There, in ardent and impassioned speeches, we must explain our programme and put the alternative: either the Conference adopts it <I>in its entirety</I>, or else insurrection. There is no middle course. Delay is impossible. The revolution is dying. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   By putting the question in this way, by concentrating our entire group in the factories and barracks, <I>we shall be able to determine the right moment to start the insurrection</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In order to treat insurrection in a Marxist way, i.e., as an art, we must at the same time, without losing a single moment, organise a <I>headquarters</I> of the insurgent detachments, distribute our forces, move the reliable regiments<A NAME="p27"> to the most important points, surround the Alexandrinsky Theatre, occupy the Peter and Paul Fortress,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MI17.html#en11">11</A>]</FONT> arrest the General Staff and the government, and move against the officer cadets and the Savage Division<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MI17.html#en12">12</A>]</FONT> those detachments which would rather die than allow the enemy to approach the strategic points of the city. We must mobilise the armed workers and call them to fight the last desperate fight occupy the telegraph and the telephone exchange at once move <I>our</I> insurrection headquarters to the central telephone exchange and connect it by telephone with all the factories, all the regiments, all the points of armed fighting, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Of course, this is all by way of example, only to <I>illustrate</I> the fact that at the present moment it is impossible to remain loyal to Marxism, to remain loyal to the revolution <I>unless insurrection is treated as an art</I>.

   <I>Blanquism</I> -- a trend within the French socialist movement led by Louis Auguste Blanqui (1805-1881), an outstanding utopian communist. "Blanquism expects that mankind will be emancipated from wage slavery, not by the proletarian class struggle, but through a conspiracy hatched by a small minority of intellectuals" (see present edition, Vol. 10, p. 392). The trend failed to reckon with the concrete situation, which must be taken into account if an insurrection is to succeed, and neglected to establish ties with the masses.

   What Lenin has in mind are the mass demonstrations which took place in Petrograd on July 3-4 (16-17), 1917. It was a movement of soldiers, sailors and workers, who were incensed at the Provisional Government for sending troops into a patently hopeless offensive which proved a fiasco. It started on July 3 (16) with a demonstration by the First Machine-Gun Regiment in the Vyborg District, and threatened to develop into an armed revolt against the Provisional Government. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Bolshevik Party was opposed to insurrection at that time because it believed that the revolutionary crisis had not yet come to a head. The Central Committee, meeting at 4.00 p.m. on July 3 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 532</B></FONT><P>

(16), decided to refrain from taking action, and a similar decision was adopted by the Second Petrograd City Conference of Bolsheviks which was just then in session. Its delegates went to the factories and the districts to stop the masses from going into action, but the movement had already got underway and nothing could be done to stop it. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   Late that night, the Central Committee, together with the Petrograd Committee and the Military Organisation, took account of the mood of the masses and decided to take part in the demonstration to lend it a peaceful and organised character. Lenin was away on a short holiday after an exhausting stretch of work. Being informed of the events, he returned to Petrograd on the morning of July 4 (17) and assumed leadership. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   More than 500,000 persons took part in the demonstration on July 4 (17). The demonstrators carried Bolshevik slogans, such as "All Power to the Soviets", and demanded that the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the Soviet should take power. But the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders refused to do so. The Provisional Government, with the knowledge and consent of the Central Executive Committee, which was dominated by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, sent detachments of officer cadets and Cossacks to attack and shoot down the peaceful demonstrators. Counter-revolutionary troops were brought in from the front to disperse the demonstrations. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   That night, Lenin presided at a meeting of members of the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee, which adopted a decision to stop the demonstrations in an organised manner. This was a wise step, for it helped to save the main revolutionary force from defeat. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries acted in a manner which helped the counter-revolutionaries: they joined the bourgeoisie in attacking the Bolshevik Party. The Bolshevik newspapers, <I>Pravda</I>, <I>Soldatskaya Pravda</I> (<I>Soldiers' Truth </I>) and others were closed down by the Provisional Government, while the <I>Trud</I> Printing House, operated on funds donated by the workers, was destroyed. The workers were disarmed and arrested, and searches and persecution were started. The revolutionary units of the Petrograd garrison were withdrawn from the capital and sent to the front. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   After the July events, power in the country passed into the hands of the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government, with the Soviet an impotent appendage. The period of dual power was at an end, and so was the revolution's peaceful stage. The Bolsheviks were faced with the task of preparing an armed insurrection to overthrow the Provisional Government.

   The counter-revolutionary revolt of the bourgeoisie and the landowners in August 1917, which was headed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the tsarist General Kornilov. The plotters planned to take Petrograd, destroy the Bolghevik Party, disperss the Soviets and set up a military dictatorship with a view to 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 533</B></FONT><P>

restoring the monarchy. Kerensky, the head of the Provisional Government, took part in the plot, but when the revolt got under way he realised that he would be swept away with Kornilov and washed his hands of the whole business: be declared the revolt was aimed against the Provisional Government. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   It broke out on August 25 (September 7), with Kornilov sending the Third Cavalry Corps against Petrograd, where counter-revolutionary organisations were itching to go into action. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The mass struggle against Kornilov was led by the Bolshevik Party, which continued, as Lenin demanded, to expose the Provisional Government and its Socialist-Revohltionary and Menshevik accomplices. The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party rallied the workers of Petrograd, and the revolutionary soldiers and sailors to struggle against the mutineers. Petrograd workers swiftly organised Red Guard units and revolutionary committees were set up in several places. The advance of the Kornilov troops was stopped and their morale undermined by Bolshevik agitators. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Kornilov revolt was crushed by the workers and peasants led by the Bolshevik Party. Under the pressure of the masses, the Provisional Government was forced to order the arrest and prosecution of Kornilov and his accomplices on charges of organising the revolt.

   <I>Cadets</I> (Constitutional-Democratic Party) -- the leading party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia, set up in October 1905. Its membership was made up of capitalists, landowners serving on local councils and bourgeois intellectuals. Among its more prominent members were P. N. Milyukov, S. A. Muromtsev, V. A. Maklakov, A. I. Shingaryov, and P. B. Struve. The Cadets eventually developed into a party of the imperialist bourgeoisie. During the First World War they actively supported the tsarist government's foreign policy of aggrandisement. During the bourgeois-democratic revolution of February 1917, they tried to save the monarchy; playing a keg part in the bourgeois Provisional Government, they conducted a counter-revolutionary policy opposed to the people's interests. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   After the Great October Socialist Revolution they became rabid enemies of Soviet power and took part in all the counter-revolutionary military operations and the campaigns of the interventionists. After the defeat of the interventionists and whiteguards, the Cadets fled abroad to continue their anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary activity.
