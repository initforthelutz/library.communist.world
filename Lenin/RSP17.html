</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The present pamphlet, as is evident from the text, was written at the end of September and was finished on October 1, 1917. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The October 25 Revolution has transferred the question raised in this pamphlet from the sphere of theory to the sphere of practice. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This question must now be answered by deeds, not words. The theoretical arguments advanced against the Bolsheviks taking power were feeble in the extreme. These arguments have been shot to pieces. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The task now is for the advanced class -- the proletariat -- to prove in practice the viability of the workers' and peasants' government. All class-conscious workers, all the active and honest peasants, all working and exploited people, will do everything they can to solve the immense historic question in practice. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To work, everybody to work, the cause of the world socialist revolution must and will triumph.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  On what are all trends agreed, from <I>Rech</I> to <I>Novaya Zhizns </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en50">50</A>]</FONT> inclusively, from the Kornilovite Cadets to the semi-Bolsheviks, all, except the Bolsheviks? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   They all agree that the Bolsheviks will either never dare take over full state power alone, or, if they do dare, and do take power, they will not be able to retain it even for the shortest while. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If anybody asserts that the question of the Bolsheviks alone taking over full state power is a totally unfeasible political question, that only a swelled-headed "fanatic" of the worst kind can regard it as feasible, we refute this assertion by quoting the exact statements of the most responsible and most influential political parties and trends of various "hues". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But let me begin with a word or two about the first of the questions mentioned -- will the Bolsheviks dare take over full state power alone? I have already had occasion, at the All-Russia Congress of Soviets, to answer this<A NAME="p90a"> question in the affirmative in no uncertain manner by a remark that I shouted from my seat during one of Tsereteli's<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en51">51</A>]</FONT> ministerial speeches. And I have not met in the press, or heard, any statements by Bolsheviks to the effect that we ought not to take power alone. I still maintain that a political party -- and the party of the advanced class in particular -- would have no right to exist, would be unworthy of the name of party, would be a nonentity in any sense, if it refused to take power when opportunity offers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We shall now quote statements by the Cadets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and semi-Bolsheviks (I would prefer to say quarter-Bolsheviks) on the question that interests us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The leading article in <I>Rech</I> of September 16: 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 91</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Discord and confusion reigned in the Alexandrinsky Theatre, and the socialist press reflects the same picture. Only the views of the Bolsheviks are definite and straightforward At the Conference, they are the views of the minority. In the Soviets, they represent a constantly growing trend. But In spite of all their verbal pugnacity, their boastful phrases and display of self-confidence, the Bolsheviks, except for a few fanatics, are brave only in words. They would not attempt to take 'full power' on their own accord. Disorganisers and disrupters <I>par excellence</I>, they are really cowards who in their heart of hearts are fully aware of both their own intrinsic ignorance and the ephemeral nature of their present successes. They know as well as we all do that the first day of their ultimate triumph would also be the first day of their precipitous fall. Irresponsible by their very nature, anarchists in method and practice, they should be regarded only as a trend of political thought, or rather, as one of its aberrations. The best way to get rid of Bolshevism for many a year, to banish it, would be to place the country's fate in the hands of its leaders. And if it were not for the awareness that experiments of this kind are impermissible and fatal, one might in desperation decide on even this heroic measure. Happily, we repeat, these dismal heroes of the day are not by any means actually out to seize full power. Not under any circumstancss are they capable of constructive work. Thus, all their definite and straight-forward views are confined to the political rostrum, to soap-box oratory. For practical purposes their position cannot be taken into consideration from any point of view. In one respect, however, it has some practical consequence: it unites all other shades of 'socialist thought' opposed to it. . . ."
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  This is the way the Cadets reason. Here, however, is the view of the biggest, "ruling and governing", party in Russia, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, also expressed in an unsigned, i.e., editorial, leading article in their official organ <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> of September 21: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     "If the bourgeoisie refuse, pending the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, to work with the democracy on the basis of the platform that was endorsed by the Conference, then the <I>coalition must arise from within the Conference itself</I>. This would be a serious sacrifice on the part of the supporters of the coalition, <I>but even those campaigning for the idea of a 'pure line' of power will have to agree to it</I>. We are afraid, however, that agreement may not be reached here. In that case a third and final combination remains, namely: the government must be organised by that half of the Conference which on principle advocated the idea of a homogeneous government. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "Let us put it definitely: <I>the Bolsheviks will be obliged to form a Cabinet</I>. With the greatest energy, they imbued the revolutionary democrats with hatred of the coalition, promising them all sorts of benefits as soon as 'compromise' was abandoned, and attributing to the latter all the country's misfortunes. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 92</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "If they were aware of what they were doing by their agitation, if they were <I>not deceiving the people, it is their duty</I> to redeem the promissory notes they have been handing out right and left. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The question is clear. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "Let them not make futile attempts to hide behind hastily concocted theory that it is impossible for them to take power. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The democracy will not accept these theories. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "At the same time, the advocates of coalition must guarantee them full support. These are the three combinations, the three ways, open to us -- there are no others!" (The italics are those of <I>Dyelo Naroda</I>.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  This is the way the Socialist-Revolutionaries reason. And here, finally, is the "position" (if attempts to sit between two stools can be called a position) of the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> "quarter-Bolsheviks", taken from the editorial in <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> of September 23. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "If a coalition with Konovalov and Kishkin is formed again, it will mean nothing but a new capitulation by the democracy and the abrogation of the Conference resolution on the formation of a responsible government on the platform of August 14. . . . 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "A homogeneous ministry of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries will be able to feel its responsibility as little as the responsible socialist ministers felt it in the coalition cabinet. . . . This government would not only be incapable of rallying the 'live forces' of the revolution around itself, but would not even be able to count on any active support from its vanguard -- the proletariat. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "But the formation of another type of homogeneous cabinet, a government of the 'proletariat and poor peasants', would be, not a better, but an even worse way out of the situation, in fact it would not be a way out at all, but sheer bankruptcy. True, nobody is advancing such a slogan except in casual, timid and later systematically 'explained away' comments in <I>Rabochy Put</I>." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (This glaring untruth is "boldly" written by responsible journalists who have forgotten even the <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> editorial of September 21.)

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
   "Formally, the Bolsheviks have now revived the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets'. It was withdrawn after the July days, when the Soviets, represented by the Central Executive Committee, definitely adopted an active anti-Bolshevik policy. Now, however, not only can the 'Soviet line' be regarded as straightened out, but there is every ground to assume that at the proposed Congress of Soviets the Bolsheviks will have a majority. Under such circumstances the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets', resurrected by the Bolsheviks, is a 'tactical line' for achieving precisely the dictatorship of the proletariat and the 'poor peasants' True, the Soviets also imply the Soviets of Peasants' Deputies; the Bolshevik slogan 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 93</B></FONT><P>

therefore implies a power resting on the overwhelmingly greater part of the entire democracy of Russia. In that case, however, the slogan 'All Power to the Soviets' loses all independent signiflcance, for it makes the Soviets almost identical in composition to the Pre-parliament set up by the Conference. . . ." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (<I>Novaya Zhizn</I>'s assertion is a brazen lie, equivalent to declaring that spurious and fraudulent democracy is "almost identical" to democracy: the Pre-parliament is a <I>sham</I> which passes off the will of the minority of the people, particularly of Kuskova, Berkenheim, Chaikovsky and Co., as the will of the majority. This is the first point. The second point is that at the Conference even the Peasants' Soviets that had been packed by the Avksentyevs and Chaikovskys gave such a high percentage opposed to the coalition that taken together with the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, they would have brought about the <I>absolute collapse of the coalition</I>. And the third point is that "Power to the Soviets" means that the power of the Peasants' Soviets would embrace mainly the rural districts, and in the rural districts the predominance of the poor peasants is assured.)

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
   "If it is one and the same thing, then the Bolshevik slogan should be immediately withdrawn. If, however, 'Power to the Soviets' is only a disguise for the dictatorship of the proletariat, then such a power would mean precisely the failure and collapse of the revolution. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "Does it need proof that the proletariat, isolated not only from the other classes in the country, but also from the real live forces of the democracy, will not be able either technically to lay hold of the state apparatus and set it in motion in an exceptionally complicated situation, or politically to resist all the pressure by hostile forces that will sweep away not only the proletarian dictatorship, but the entire revolution into the baryain? 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The only power that will answer the requirements of the present situation is a really honest coalition within the democracy."

   We apologise to the reader for quoting these lengthy extracts, but they are absolutely necessary. It is necessary to present a precise picture of the positions taken by the different parties hostile to the Bolsheviks. It is 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 94</B></FONT><P>

necessary to prove in a definite manner the extremely important fact-that <I>all</I> these parties have admitted that the question of the Bolsheviks taking full state power alone is not only feasible, but also urgent. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us now proceed to examine the arguments which convince "everybody", from the Cadets to the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> people, that the Bolsheviks will not be able to retain power. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The respectable <I>Rech</I> advances no arguments whatsoever. It merely pours out upon the Bolsheviks a flood of the choicest and most irate abuse. The extract we quoted shows, among other things, how utterly wrong it would be to say, "Watch out, comrades, for what the enemy advises must certainly be bad", thinking that <I>Rech</I> is "provoking" the Bolsheviks to take power. If, instead of weighing up the general and concrete considerations in a practical way, we allow ourselves to be "persuaded" by the plea that the bourgeoisie are "provoking" us to take power, we shall be fooled by the bourgeoisie, for the latter will of course always maliciously prophesy millions of disasters that will result from the Bolsheviks taking power and will always maliciously shout, "It would be better to get rid of the Bolsheviks at one blow and 'for many a year' by allowing them to take power and then crushing them." These cries are also "provocation", if you will, but from a different angle. The Cadets and the bourgeoisie do not by any means "advise", and have never "advised", us to take power; they are only trying to <I>frighten</I> us with the allegedly insoluble problems of government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No. We must not allow ourselves to be frightened by the screams of the frightened bourgeoisie. We must bear firmly in mind that we have never set ourselves "insoluble" social problems, and as for the <I>perfectly</I> soluble problem of taking immediate steps towards socialism, which is the only way out of the exceedingly difficult situation, that will be <I>solved only</I> by the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasants. Victory, and lasting victory, is now more than ever, more than anywhere else, assured for the proletariat in Russia if it takes power. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We shall in a purely practical manner discuss the <I>concrete</I> circumstances that make a certain moment unfavourable; but we shall not for a moment allow ourselves to be 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 95</B></FONT><P>

scared by the savage howls of the bourgeoisie; and we shall not forget that the question of the Bolsheviks taking full power is becoming really <I>urgent</I>. Our Party will now be threatened with an immeasurably greater danger if we forget this than if we were to admit that taking power is "premature". In this respect, there can be <I>nothing</I> "premature" now: there is every chance in a million, except one or two perhaps, in favour of this.   Concerning the irate abuse poured out by <I>Rech</I>, we can and must, say:

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  That the bourgeoisie hate us so passionately is one of the most striking proofs that we are showing the people the <I>right</I> ways and means of overthrowing the rule of the bourgeoisie. 
<P>
<CENTER>* &nbsp; &nbsp; * <BR>

</CENTER> 
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  This time, by way of rare exception, <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> did not deign to honour us with its abuse nor did it advance a ghost of an argument. It merely tried, by indirect hints, to <I>frighten</I> us with the prospect that "the Bolsheviks will be obliged to form a cabinet". I can quite believe that while trying to frighten us, the Socialist-Revolutionaries are themselves sincerely seared to death by the phantom of the frightened liberal. I can equally believe that the Socialist-Revolutionaries do succeed in certain exceptionally high and esceptionally rotten institutions, such as the Central Executive Committee and similar "contact" (i.e., contact with the Cadets, in plain language, hobnobbing with the Cadets) commissions, in scaring some Bolsheviks because, first, the atmosphere in all those Central Executives, pre-parliaments, etc., is abominable, putrid to the point of nausea, and harmful for <I>any</I> man to breathe for any length of time; and secondly, sincerity is contagious, and a sincerely frightened philistine is capable of converting even an individual revolutionary into a philistine for a time. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 96</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  But however much we may, "humanly" speaking, understand the sincere fright of a Socialist-Revolutionary who has had the misfortune to be a minister in the company of the Cadets, or who is eligible as a minister in the eyes of the Cadets, we would be committing a political error that might only too easily border on treachery to the proletariat if we allowed ourselves to be scared. Let us have your practical arguments, gentlement! Cherish no hope that we shall allow ourselves to be scared by your fright! 
<P>
<CENTER>* &nbsp; &nbsp; * <BR>

</CENTER> 
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  This time we find practical arguments only in <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>. On this occasion the paper comes out in the role of counsel for the bourgeoisie, a role that suits it far better than that of counsel for the defence of the Bolsheviks, which so obviously "shocks" this lady with many good points.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en53">53</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The counsel has advanced <I>six</I> pleas: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (1)&nbsp;the proletariat is "isolated from the other classes in the country"; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (2)&nbsp;it is "isolated from the real live forces of the democracy"; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (3)&nbsp;it "will not be able technically to lay hold of the state apparatus"; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (4)&nbsp;it "will not be able to set this apparatus in motion"; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (5)&nbsp;"the situation is exceptionally complicated"; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (6)&nbsp;it "will be incapable of resisting all the pressure by hostile forces that will sweep away not only the proletarian dictatorship, but the entire revolution into the bargain". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> formulates the first plea in a ridiculously clumsy fashion, for in capitalist and semi-capitalist society we know of only three classes: the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie (which consists mainly of the peasantry), and the proletariat. What sense is there in talking about the proletariat being isolated from the other classes when the point at issue is the proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, revolution against the bourgeoisie? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Evidently, <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> wanted to say that the proletariat is isolated from the peasants, for it could not possibly have meant the landowners. It could not, however, say clearly and definitely that the proletariat is now isolated 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 97</B></FONT><P>

from the peasants, for the utter incorrectness of this assertion would be too obvious. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is difficult to imagine that in a capitalist country the proletariat should be so little isolated from the petty bourgeoisie -- and, mark you, in a revolution <I>against the bourgeoisie</I> -- as the proletariat now is in Russia. The latest returns of the voting by "curias" <I>for</I> and <I>against</I> coalition with the bourgeoisie in Tsereteli's "Bulygin Duma", i.e., in the notorious "Democratic" Conference, constitute one of the objective and incontrovertible proofs of this. If we take the Soviets' curias we get:

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  So, the majority as a whole is on the side of the proletarian slogan: <I>against</I> coalition with the bourgeoisie. We have seen above that even the Cadets are obliged to admit the growth of Bolshevik influence in the Soviets. And here we have the Conference convened by <I>yesterday's</I> leaders in the Soviets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who have an assured majority in the central institutions! Obviously, the <I>actual</I> degree to which the Bolsheviks predominate in the Soviets is here <I>understated</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Both on the question of coalition with the bourgeoisie and on the question of immediately transferring the landed estates to peasant committees, the Bolsheviks already have a majority in the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, a <I>majority of the people</I>, a majority of the petty bourgeoisie.<A NAME="p97"> <I>Rabochy Put</I> No. 19, of September 24 quotes from No. 25 of the organ of the Socialist-Revolutionaries <I>Znamya Truda</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en54">54</A>]</FONT> a report on a conference of local Soviets of Peasants' Deputies held in Petrograd on September 18. At this conference the Executive Committees of four Peasants' Soviets (Kostroma, Moscow, Samara and Taurida gubernias) voted for an unrestricted coalition. The Executive Committees of <I>three</I> gubernias and <I>two</I> armies (Vladimir, Ryazan and the Black Sea gubernias) voted in favour of a coalition without the Cadets. The Executive Committees 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 98</B></FONT><P>

of twenty-three gubernias and four armies voted against a coalition. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>So</I>, <I>the majority of the peasants are against a coalition!</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   So much for the "isolation of the proletariat". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We should note, by the way, that the supporters of a coalition were three outlying gubernias, Samara, Taurida and the Black Sea, where there is a relatively very large number of rich peasants and big landowners who employ hired labour, and also four industrial gubernias (Vladimir, Ryazan, Kostroma and Moscow) in which the peasant bourgeoisie are also stronger than in the majority of the gubernias in Russia. It would be interesting to collect more detailed figures on this question and to ascertain whether information is available concerning the <I>poor</I> peasants in the gubernias where there are larger numbers of "<I>rich </I>" peasants.  It is interesting, moreover, that the "non-Russian groups" revealed a considerable predominance of opponents of a coalition, namely, 40 votes against 15. The policy of annexation and open violence pursued by the Bonapartist Kerensky and Co. towards the non-sovereign nations of Russia has borne fruit. Wide sections of the people of the oppressed nations (i.e., including the mass of the petty bourgeoisie) trust the proletariat of Russia more than they do the bourgeoisie, for here history has brought to the fore the struggle for liberation of the oppressed nations against the oppressing nations. The bourgeoisie has despicably betrayed the cause of freedom of the oppressed nations; the proletariat is faithful to tbe cause of freedom. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  At the present time the national and agrarian questions are fundamental questions for the petty-bourgeois sections of the population of Russia. This is indisputable. And on both these questions the proletariat is "<I>not</I> isolated" -- farther from it than ever. It has the majority of the people behind it. It <I>alone</I> is capable of pursuing such a determined, genuinely."revolutionary-democratic" policy on both questions which would immediately ensure the proletarian state power not only the support of the majority of the population, but also a real outburst of revolutionary enthusiasm among the people. This is because, for the first time, the people would not see the ruthless oppression of peasants by landowners and of Ukrainians by Great Russians on the part of the

government, as was the case under tsarism, nor the effort to continue the same policy camouflaged in pompous phrases under the republic, nor nagging, insult, chicanery, procrastination, underhand dealing and evasions (all that with which Kerensky rewards the peasants and the oppressed nations), but would receive warm sympathy proved by deeds, immediate and revolutionary measures against the landowners, immediate restitution of <I>full</I> freedom for Finland, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, for the Moslems, and so on. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik gentlemen know this perfectly well, and are therefore dragging in the semi-Cadet bosses of the co-operative societies to help them pursue their <I>reactionary</I>-democratic policy <I>against</I> the people. That is why they will never dare canvass popular opinion, take a popular referendum, or at least a vote of all the local Soviets, of all the local organisations, concerning definite points of practical policy, for example, whether all the landed estates should at once be handed over to peasant committees, whether certain demands of the Finns or the Ukrainians should be conceded, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take the question of peace, the crucial issue of today. The proletariat "is isolated from the other classes". . . . On this issue the proletariat truly represents the <I>whole</I> nation, all live and honest people in <I>all classes</I>, the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie; because only the proletariat, on achieving power, will <I>immediately</I> offer a just peace to all the belligerent nations, because only the proletariat will dare take genuinely <I>revolutionary</I> measures (publication of the secret treaties, and so forth) to achieve the speediest and most just peace possible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The proletariat is not isolated. The gentlemen of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> who are shouting about the proletariat being isolated are only betraying their subjective fear of the bourgeoisie. The objective state of affairs in Russia is undoubtedly such that the proletariat, <I>precisely at the present time</I>, is not "isolated" from the majority of the petty bourgeoisie. Precisely now, after the sad experience with the "coalition", the proletariat enjoys the sympathy of the <I>majority</I> of the people. <I>This</I> condition for the retention of power by the Bolsheviks <I>does</I> exist.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The second plea is that the proletariat "is isolated from the real live forces of the democracy". What this means is incomprehensihle. It is probably "Greek", as the French say in such cases. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The writers of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> would make good ministers. They would be quite suitable as ministers in a Cadet cabinet because all these ministers need is the ability to spout plausible, polished, but utterly meaningless phrases with which to cover up the dirtiest work and which are therefore sure of winning the applause of the imperialists and social-imperialists. The <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> writers are sure to earn the applause of the Cadets, Breshkovskaya, Plekhanov and Co. for asserting that the proletariat is isolated from the real live forces of the democracy, because <I>indirectly</I> they imply -- or will be understood to imply -- that the Cadets, Breshkovskaya, Plekhanov, Kerensky and Co. are the "live forces of democracy". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is not true. They are dead forces. The history of the coalition has proved this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp<A NAME="p100">
   Overawed by the bourgeoisie and by their bourgeois lntellectual environment, the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> people regard as "live" the Right wing of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks like <I>Volya Naroda </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en56">56</A>]</FONT>, <I>Yedinstvo</I>, and others who in essentials do not differ from the Cadets. We, however, regard as live only those who are connected with the people and not with the kulaks, only those whom the lessons of the coalition have repelled. The "active live forces" of the petty-bourgeois democracy are represented by the Left wing of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. That this wing has gained strength, particularly since the July counter-revolution, is one of the surest objective signs that the proletariat is <I>not</I> isolated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This has been made even more strikingly evident by the very recent swing to the left of the Socialist-Revolutionary Centrists, as is proved by Chernov's statement on September 24 that his group cannot support the new coalition with Kishkin and Co. This swing to the left of the Socialist-Revolutionary Centre, which up to now had constituted the overwhelming majority of the members of the Socialist-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 101</B></FONT><P>

Revolutionary Party, the leading and dominant party from the point of view of the number of votes it obtained in the urban and particularly in the rural districts, proves that the statements we quoted from <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> that the democracy must, under certain circumstances, "guarantee full support" for a purely Bolshevik government are at any rate not mere empty phrases. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Facts like the refusal of the Socialist-Revolutionary Centre to support the new coalition with Kishkin, or the predominance of the <I>opponents</I> of the coalition among the Menshevik-<I>defencists</I> in the provinces (Jordania in the Caucasus, etc.), are objective proof that a certain section of the <I>people</I> which has up to now followed the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries <I>will support</I> a purely Bolshevik government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is precisely from the <I>live</I> forces of the democracy that the proletariat of Russia is now not isolated.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The third plea, that the proletariat "will not be able technically to lay hold of the state apparatus" is, perhaps, the most common and most frequent. It deserves most attention for this reason, and also because it indicates one of the most <I>serious</I> and <I>difficult</I> tasks that will confront the victorious proletariat. There is no doubt that these tasks will be very difficult, but if we, who call ourselves socialists, indicate this difficulty only to <I>shirk</I> these tasks, in practice the distinction between us and the lackeys of the bourgeoisie will be reduced to nought. The difficulty of the tasks of the proletarian revolution should prompt the proletariat's supporters to make a closer and more definite study of the means of carrying out these tasks. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The state apparatus is primarily the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy. By saying that the proletariat will not he able technically to lay hold of this apparatus, the writers of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> reveal their utter ignorance and their reluctance to take into account either facts or the arguments long ago cited in Bolshevik literature. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> writers regard themselves, if not as Marxists, then at least as being familiar with Marxism, as educated socialists. But Marx, basing himself on the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 102</B></FONT><P>

experience of the Paris Commune, taught that the proletariat cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machine and use it for its own purposes, that the proletariat must smash this machine and substitute a new one for it (I deal with this in greater detail in a pamphlet, the first part of which is now finished and will soon appear under the title <I><A HREF="SR17.html">The State and Revolution</A></I>. <I>A Marxist Theory of the State and the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#fnp102">*</A>]</FONT>). This new type of state machinery was created by the Paris Commune, and the Russian Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies are a "state apparatus" of the same type. I have indicated this many times since April 4, 1917; it is dealt with in the resolutions of Bolshevik conferences and also in Bolshevik literature. <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> could, of course, have expressed its utter disagreement with Marx and with the Bolsheviks, but for a paper that has so often, and so haughtily, scolded the Bolsheviks for their allegedly frivolous attitude to difficult problems to evade this question completely is tantamount to issuing itself a certificate of mental poverty. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The proletariat <I>cannot</I> "lay hold of" the "state apparatus" and "set it in motion". But it can <I>smash</I> everything that is oppressive, routine, incorrigibly bourgeois in the old state apparatus and substitute its <I>own</I>, new apparatus. The Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies. are exactly this apparatus. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> has completely forgotten about this "state apparatus" can be called nothing but monstrous. Behaving in this way in their theoretical reasoning, the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> people are, in essence, doing in the sphere of political theory what the Cadets are doing in political practice. Because, if the proletariat and the revolutionary democrats <I>do not</I> in fact <I>need</I> a new state apparatus, then the Soviets lose their <I>raison d'&ecircetre</I>, lose their right to existence, and the Kornilovite Cadets are <I>right</I> in trying to reduce the Soviets to nought! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This monstrous theoretical blunder and political blindness on the part of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> is all the more monstrous because even the internationalist Mensheviks (with whom <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> formed a bloc during the last City Council

elections in Petrograd) have on this question shown some proximity to the Bolsheviks. So, in the declaration of the Soviet majority made by Comrade Martov at the Democratic Conference, we read: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, set up in the first days of the revolution by a mighty burst of creative enthusiasm that stems from the people themselves, constitute the new fabric of the revolutionary state that has replaced the outworn state fabric of the old regime. . . ." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is a little too flowery; that is to say, rhetoric here covers up lack of clear political thinking. The Soviets have <I>not yet</I> replaced the old "fabric", and this old "fabric" is <I>not</I> the state fabric of the old regime, but the state fabric of <I>both</I> tsarism <I>and</I> of the bourgeois republic. But at any rate, Martov here stands head and shoulders above <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Soviets are a new state apparatus which, in the first place, provides an armed force of workers and peasants; and this force is not divorced from the people, as was the old standing army, but is very closely bound up with the people. From the military point of view this force is incomparably more powerful than previous forces; from the revolutionary point of view, it cannot be replaced by anything else. Secondly, this apparatus provides a bond with the people, with the majority of the people, so intimate, so indissoluble, so easily verifiable and renewable, that nothing even remotely like it existed in the previous state apparatus. Thirdly, this apparatus, by virtue of the fact that its personnel is elected and subject to recall at the people's will without any bureaucratic formalities, is far more democratic than any previous apparstus. Fourthly, it provides a close contact with the most varied professions, thereby facilitating the adoption of the most varied and most radical reforms without red tape. Fifthly, it provides an organisational form for the vanguard, i.e., for the most class-conscious, most energetic and most progressive section of the oppressed classes, the workers and peasants, and so constitutes an apparatus by means of which the vanguard of the <I>oppressed</I> classes can elevate, train, educate, and lead <I>the entire vast mass</I> of these classes, which has up to now stood completely outside of political life and history. Sixthly, it makes it possible to combine the advantages of the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 104</B></FONT><P>

parliamentary system with those of immediate and direct democracy, i.e., to vest in the people's elected representatives both legislative <I>and executive</I> functions. Compared with the bourgeois parliamentary system, this is an advance in democracy's development which is of world-wide, historic significance. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In 1905, our Sovlets existed only in embryo, so to speak, as they lived altogether only a few weeks. Clearly, under the conditions of that time, their comprehensive development was out of the question. It is still out of the question in the 1917 Revolution, for a few months is an extremely short period and -- this is most important -- the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders have <I>prostituted</I> the Soviets, have reduced their role to that of a talking shop, of an accomplice in the compromising policy of the leaders. The Soviets have been rotting and decaying alive under the leadership of the Liebers, Dans, Tseretelis and Chernovs. The Soviets will be able to develop properly, to display their potentialities and capabilities to the full only by taking over <I>full</I> state power; for otherwise they have <I>nothing to do</I>, otherwise they are either simply embryos (and to remain an embryo too long is fatal), or playthings. "Dual power" means paralysis for the Soviets. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If the creative enthusiasm of the revolutionary classes had not given rise to the Soviets, the proletarian revolution in Russia would have been a hopeless cause, for the proletariat could certainly not retain power with the old state apparatus, and it is impossible to create a new apparatus immediately. The sad history of the prostitution of the Soviets by the Tseretelis and Chernovs, the history of the "coalition", is also the history of the liberation of the Soviets from petty-bourgeois illusions, of their passage through the "purgatory" of the practical experience of the utter abomination and filth of <I>all</I> and <I>sundry</I> bourgeois coalitions. Let us hope that this "purgatory" has steeled rather than weakened the Soviets.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The chief difficulty facing the proletarian revolution is the establishment on a country-wide scale of the most precise and most conscientious accounting and control, of

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 105</B></FONT><P>

<I>workers' control</I> of the production and distribution of goods. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When the writers of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> argued that in advancing the slogan "workers' control" we were slipping into syndicalism, this argument was an example of the stupid school boy method of applying "Marxism" without studying it, just <I>learning it by rote</I> in the Struve manner. Syndicalism either repudiates the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat, or else relegates it, as it does political power in general, to a back seat. We, however, put it in the forefront. If we simply say in unison with the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> writers: <I>not</I> workers' control <I>but</I> state control, it is simply a bourgeois-reformist phrase, it is, in essence, a purely Cadet formula, because the Cadets have no objection to the workers <I>participating</I> in "state" control. The Kornilovite Cadets know perfectly well that such participation offers the bourgeoisie the best way of fooling the workers, the most subtle way of politically <I>bribing</I> all the Gvozdyovs, Nikitins, Prokopoviches, Tseretelis and the rest of that gang. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When we say: "workers' control", always <I>juxtaposing</I> this slogan to dictatorship of the proletariat, always putting it <I>immediately after</I> the latter, we thereby explain what kind of state we mean. The state is the organ of <I>class</I> domination. Of which class? If of the bourgeoisie, then it is the Cadet-Kornilov-"Kerensky" state which has been "Kornilovising" and "Kerenskyising" the working people of Russia for more than six months. If it is of the proletariat, if we are speaking of a proletarian state, <I>that is</I>, of tbe proletarian dictatorship, then workers' control <I>can</I> become the country-wide, all-embracing, omnipresent, most precise and most conscientious <I>accounting</I> of the production and distribution of goods. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is the chief difficulty, the chief task that faces the proletarian, i.e., socialist, revolution. Without the Soviets, this task would be impracticable, at least in Russia. The Soviets <I>indicate</I> to the proletariat the organisational work which <I>can</I> solve this historically important problem. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This brings us to another aspect of the question of the state apparatus. In addition to the chiefly "oppressive" apparatus -- the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy -- the modern state possesses an apparatus which has 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 106</B></FONT><P>

extremely close connections with the banks and syndicates, an apparatus which performs an enormous amount of accounting and registration work, if it may be expressed this way. This apparatus must not, and should not, be smashed. It must be wrested from the control of the capitalists; the capitalists and the wires they pull must be <I>cut off</I>, <I>lopped off</I>, <I>chopped away from</I> this apparatus; it must be <I>subordinated</I> to the proletarian Soviets; it must be expanded, made more comprehensive, and nation-wide. And this <I>can</I> be done by utilising the achievements already made by large-scale capitalism (in the same way as the proletarian revolution can, in general, reach its goal only by utilising these achievements). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Capitalism has created an accounting <I>apparatus</I> in the shape of the banks, syndicates, postal service, consumers' societies, and office employees' unions. <I>Without big banks socialism would be impossible</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The big banks <I>are</I> the "state apparatus" which we <I>need</I> to bring about socialism, and which we <I>take ready-made</I> from capitalism; our task here is merely to lop off what <I>capitalistically mutilates</I> this excellent apparatus, to make it <I>even bigger</I>, even more democratic, even more comprehensive. Quantity will be transformed into quality. A single State Bank, the biggest of the big, with branches in every rural district, in every factory, will constitute as much as nine-tenths of the <I>socialist</I> apparatus. This will be country wide <I>book-keeping</I>, country-wide <I>accounting</I> of the production and distribution of goods, this will be, so to speak, some thing in the nature of the <I>skeleton</I> of socialist society. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We can "lay hold of" and "set in motion" this "state apparatus" (which is not fully a state apparatus under capitalism, but which will be so with us, under socialism) at one stroke, by a single decree, because the actual work of book-keeping, control, registering, accounting andcounting is performed by <I>employees</I>, the majority of whom themselves lead a proletarian or semi-proletarian existence. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   By a single decree of the proletarian government these employees can and must be transferred to the status of state employees, in the same way as the watchdogs of capitalism like Briand and other bourgeois ministers, by a single decree, transfer railwaymen on strike to the status of state employees. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 107</B></FONT><P>

We shall need many more state employees of this kind, and more <I>can</I> be obtained, because capitalism has simplified the work of accounting and control, has reduced it to a comparatively simple system of <I>book-keeping</I>, which any literate person can do. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The conversion of the bank, syndicate, commercial, etc., etc., rank-and-file employees into state employees is quite feasible both technically (thanks to the preliminary work performed for us by capitalism, including finance capitalism) and politically, provided the <I>Soviets</I> exercise control and supervision. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As for the higher officials, of whom there are very few, but who gravitate towards the capitalists, they will have to be dealt with in the same way as the capitalists, i.e., "severely". Like the capitalists, they will offer <I>resistance</I>. This resistance will have to be <I>broken</I>, and if the immortally na&iumlve Peshekhonov, as early as June 1917, lisped like the infant that he was in state affairs, that "the resistance of the capitalists has been broken", this childish phrase, this childish boast, this childish swagger, <I>will be converted by the proletariat into reality</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We can do this, for it is merely a question of breaking the resistance of an insignificant minority of the population, literally a handful of people, over each of whom the employees' unions, the trade unions, the consumers'<A NAME="p107"> societies and the Soviets will institute such <I>supervision</I> that every Tit Titych will be <I>surrounded</I> as the French were at Sedan.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en56">56</A>]</FONT> We know these Tit Tityches by name: we only have to con sult the lists of directors, board members, large shareholders, etc. There are several hundred, at most several thousand of them in the <I>whole</I> of Russia, and the proletarian state, with the apparatus of the Soviets, of the employees' unions, etc., will be able to appoint ten or even a hundred supervisers to each of them, so that instead of "breaking resistance" it may even be possible, by means of <I>workers' control</I> (over the capitalists), to make all resistance <I>impossible</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The important thing will not be even the confiscation of the capitalists' property, but country-wide, all-embracing workers' control over the capitalists and their possible supporters. Confiscation alone leads nowhere, as it does not contain the element of organisation, of accounting for 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 108</B></FONT><P><A NAME="p108">

proper distribution. Instead of confiscation, we could easily impose a <I>fair</I> tax (even on the Shingaryov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en56a">56a</A>]</FONT> scale, for instance), taking care, of course, to preclude the possibility of anyone evading assessment, concealing the truth, evading the law. And this possibility can be <I>eliminated only</I> by the workers' control of the <I>workers' state</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Compulsory syndication</I>, i.e., compulsory amalgamation in associations under state control -- this is what capitalism has prepared the way for, this is what has been carried out in Germany by the Junkers' state, this is what can be easily carried out in Russia by the Soviets, by the proletarian dictatorship, and this is what will <I>provide us with a state apparatus</I> that will be universal, up-to-date, and non-bureaucratic.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#fnp108">*</A>]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The fourth plea of the counsels for the bourgeoisie is that the proletariat will not be able "to set the state apparatus in motion". There is nothing new in this plea compared with the preceding one. We could not, of course, either lay hold of or set in motion the old apparatus. The new apparatus, the Soviets, <I>has already</I> been set in motion by "a mighty burst of creative enthusiasm that stems from the people themselves". We only have to free it from the <I>shackles</I> put on it by the domination of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders. This apparatus <I>is already</I> in motion; we only have to free it from the monstrous, petty-bourgeois impediments preventing it from going full speed ahead. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Two circumstances must be considered here to supplement what has already been said. In the first place, the new means of control have been created <I>not</I> by us, but by capitalism in its military-imperialist stage; and in the second place, it is important to introduce more democracy into the <I>administration</I> of a proletarian state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The grain monopoly and bread rationing were introduced not by us, but by the capitalist state in war-time. It had

</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 109</B></FONT><P>

already introduced universal labour conscription within the framework of capitalism, which is war-time penal servitude for the workers. But here too, as in all its history-making activities, the proletariat takes its weapons from capitalism and does not "invent" or "create them out of nothing". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The grain monopoly, bread rationing and labour conscription in the hands of the proletarian state, in the hands of sovereign Soviets, will be the most powerful means of accounting and control, means which, applied to the capitalists, and to <I>the rich in general</I>, applied to them by the <I>workers</I>, will provide a force unprecedented in history for "setting the state apparatus in motion", for overcoming the resistance of the capitalists, for subordinating them to the proletarian state. These means of control and of <I>compelling people to work</I> will be more potent than the laws of the Convention and its guillotine. The guillotine only terrorised, only broke <I>active</I> resistance. <I>For us</I>, <I>this is not enough</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For us, this is not enough. We must not only "terrorise" the capitalists, i.e., make them feel the omnipotence of the proletarian state and give up all idea of actively resisting it. We must also break <I>passive</I> resistance, which is undoubtedly more dangerous and harmful. We must not only break resistance of every kind. We must also <I>compel the capitalists to work</I> within the framework of the new state organisation. It is not enough to "remove" the capitalists; we must (after removing the undesirable and incorrigible "resisters") employ them <I>in the service of the new state</I>. This applies both to the capitalists and to the upper section of the bourgeois intellectuals, office employees, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And we have the means to do this. The means and instruments for this have been placed in our hands by the capitalist state in the war. These means are the grain monopoly, bread rationing and labour conscription. "He who does not work, neither shall he eat" -- this is the fundamental, the first and most important rule the Soviets of Workers' Deputies can and will introduce when they become the ruling power. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Every worker has a work-book. This book does not degrade him, although <I>at present</I> it is undoubtedly a document of capitalist wage-slavery, certifying that the workman belongs to some parasite. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 110</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The Soviets wilI introduce work-books <I>for the rich</I> and then gradually for the whole population (in a peasant country work-books will probably not be needed for a long time for the overwhelming majority of the peasants). The work-book will cease to be the badge of the "common herd", a document of the "lower" orders, a certificate of wage-slavery. It will become a document certifying that in the new society there are no longer any "workmen", nor, on the other hand, are there any longer men <I>who do not work</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The rich will be obliged to get a work-book from the workers' or office employees' union with which their occupation is most closely connected, and every week, or other definite fixed period, they will have to get from that union a certificate to the effect that they are performing their work conscientiously; without this they will not be able to receive bread ration cards or provisions in general. The proletarian state will say: we need good organisers of banking and the amalgamation of enterprises (in this matter the capitalists have more experience, and it is easier to work with experienced people), and we need far, far more engineers, agronomists, technicians and scientifically trained specialists of every kind than were needed before. We shall give all these specialists work to which they are accustomed and which they can cope with; in all probability we shall introduce complete wage equality only gradually and shall pay these specialists higher salaries during the transition period. We shall place them, however, under comprehensive workers' control and we shall achieve the complete and absolute operation of the rule "He who does not work, neither shall he eat." We shall not invent the organisational form of the work, but take it ready-made from capitalism -- we shall take over the banks, syndicates, the best factories, experimental stations, academies, and so forth; all that we shall have to do is to borrow the best models furnished by the advanced countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Of course, we shall not in the least descend to a utopia, we are not deserting tbe soil of most sober, practical reason when we say that the entire capitalist class will ofter the most stubborn resistance, but this resistance will be broken by the organisation of the entire population in Soviets. Those capitalists who are exceptionally stubborn and 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 111</B></FONT><P>

recalcitrant will, of course, have to be punished by the confiscation of their whole property and by imprisonment. On the other hand, however, the victory of the proletariat will bring about an <I>increase</I> in the number of cases of the kind that I read about in today's <I>Izvestia</I> for example: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "On September 26, two engineers came to the Central Council of Factory Committees to report that a group of engineers had decided to form a union of socialist engineers. The Union believes that the present time is actually the beginning of the social revolution and places itself at the disposal of the working people, desiring, in defence of the workers' interests, to work in complete unity with the workers' organisations. The representatives of the Central Council of Factory Committees answered that the Council will gladly set up in its organisation an Engineers' Section which will embody in its programme the main theses of the First Conference of Factory Committees on workers' control over production. A joint meeting of delegates of the Central Council of Factory Committees and of the initiative group of socialist engineers will be held within the next few days."

   The proletariat, we are told, will not be able to set the state apparatus in motion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Since the 1905 revolution, Russia has been governed by 130,000 landowners, who have perpetrated endless violence against 150,000,000 people, heaped unconstrained abuse upon them, and condemned the vast majority to inhuman toil and semi-starvation.

    Yet we are told that the 240,000 members of the Bolshevik Party will not be able to govern Russia, govern her in the interests of the poor and against the rich. These 240,000 are already backed by no less than a million votes of the adult population, for this is precicely the proportion between the number of Party members and the number of votes cast for the Party that has been established by the experience of Europe and the experience of Russia as shown, for example, by the elections to the Petrograd City Council last August. We therefore already have a "state apparatus" of <I>one million</I> people devoted to the socialist state for the sake of high ideals and not for the sake of a fat sum received on the 20th of every month. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In addition to that we have a "magic way" to enlarge our state apparatus <I>tenfold</I> at once, at one stroke, a way which no 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 112</B></FONT><P>

capitalist state ever possessed or could possess. This magic way is to draw the working people, to draw the poor, into the daily work of state administration. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To explain how easy it will be to employ this magic way and how faultlessly it will operate, let us take the simplest and most striking example possible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The state is to forcibly evict a certain family from a flat and move another in. This often happens in the capitalist state, and it will also happen in our proletarian or socialist state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The capitalist state evicts a working-class family which has lost its breadwinner and cannot pay the rent. The bailiff appears with police, or militia, a whole squad of them. To effect an eviction in a working-class district a whole detachment of Cossacks is required. Why? Because the bailiff and the militiaman refuse to go without a very strong military guard. They know that the scene of an eviction arouses such fury among the neighbours, among thousands and thousands of people who have been driven to the verge of desperation, arouses such hatred towards the capitalists and the capitalist state, that the bailiff and the squad of militiamen run the risk of being torn to pieces at any minute. Large military forces are required, several regiments must be brought into a big city, and the troops must come from some distant, outlying region so that the soldiers will not be familiar with the life of the urban poor, so that the soldiers will not be "infected" with socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The proletarian state has to forcibly move a very poor family into a rich man's flat. Let us suppose that our squad of workers' militia is fifteen strong; two sailors, two soldiers, two class-conscious workers (of whom, let us suppose, only one is a member of our Party, or a sympathiser), one intellectual, and eight from the poor working people, of whom at least five must be women, domestic servants, unskilled labourers, and so forth. The squad arrives at the rich man's flat, inspects it and finds that it consists of five rooms occupied by two men and two women -- "You must squeeze up a bit into two rooms this winter, citizens, and prepare two rooms for two families now living in cellars. Until the time, with the aid of engineers (you are an engineer, aren't you?), we have built good dwellings for everybody, you will 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 113</B></FONT><P>

have to squeeze up a little. Your telephone will serve ten families. This will save a hundred hours of work wasted on shopping, and so forth. Now in your family there are two unemployed persons who can perform light work: a citizeness fifty-five years of age and a citizen fourteen years of age. They will be on duty for three hours a day supervising the proper distribution of provisions for ten families and keeping the necessary account of this. The student citizen in our squad will now write out this state order in two copies and you will be kind enough to give us a signed declaration that you will faithfully carry it out." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This, in my opinion, can illustrate how the distinction between the old bourgeois and the new socialist state apparatus and state administration could be illustrated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are not utopians. We know that an unskilled labourer or a cook cannot immediately get on with the job of state administration. In this we agree with the Cadets, with Breshkovskaya, and with Tsereteli. We differ, however, from these citizens in that we demand an immediate break with the prejudiced view that only the rich, or officials chosen from rich families, are capable of <I>administering</I> the state, of performing the ordinary, everyday work of administration. We demahd that <I>training</I> in the work of state administration be conducted by class-conscious workers and soldiers and that this training be begun at once, i.e., that a <I>beginning</I> be made at once in training all the working people, all the poor, for this work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We know that the Cadets are also willing to teach the people democracy. Cadet ladies are willing to deliver lectures to domestic servants on equal rights for women in accordance with the best English and French sources. And also, at the very next concert-meeting, before an audience of thousands, an exchange of kisses will be arranged on the platform: the Cadet lady lecturer will kiss Breshkovskaya, Breshkovskaya will kiss ex-Minister Tsereteli, and the grateful people will therefore receive an object-lesson in republican equality, liberty and fraternity. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Yes, we agree that the Cadets, Breshkovskaya and Tsereteli are in their own way devoted to democracy and are propagating it among the people. But what is to be done if our conception of democracy is somewhat different from theirs? 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 114</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In our opinion, to ease the incredible burdens and miseries of the war and also to heal the terrible wounds the war has inflicted on the people, <I>revolutionary</I> democracy is needed, <I>revlutionary measures</I> of the kind described in the example of the distribution of housing accommodation in the interests of the poor. <I>Exactly the same</I> procedure must be adopted in both town and country for the distribution of provisions, clothing, footwear, etc., in respect of the land in the rural districts, and so forth. For the administration of the state in <I>this</I> spirit we can <I>at once set in motion a state</I> apparatus consisting of ten if not twenty million people, an apparatus such as no capitalist state has ever known. We alone can create such an apparatus, for we are sure of the fullest and devoted sympathy of the vast majority of the population. We alone can create such an apparatus, because we have class-conscious workers disciplined by long capitalist "schooling" (it was not for nothing that we went to learn in the school of capitalism), workers who are <I>capable</I> of forming a workers' militia and of <I>gradually</I> expanding it (beginning to expand it at once) into a militia <I>embracing the whole people</I>. The class-conscious workers must lead, but for the work of administration they can enlist the vast mass of the working and oppressed people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It goes without saying that this new apparatus is bound to make mistakes in taking its first steps. But did not the peasants make mistakes when they emerged from serfdom and began to manage their own affairs? Is there any way other than practice by which the people can learn to govern themselves and to avoid mistakes? Is there any way other than by proceeding immediately to genuine self-government by the people? The chief thing now is to abandon the prejudiced bourgeois-intellectualist view that only special officials, who by their very social position are entirely dependent upon capital, can administer the state. The chief thing is to put an end to the state of affairs in which bourgeois of ficials and "socialist" ministers are trying to govern in the old way, but are incapable of doing so and, after seven months, are faced with a peasant revolt in a peasant country! The chief thing is to imbue the oppressed and the working people with confidence in their own strength, to prove to them in practice that they can and must themselves ensure 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 115</B></FONT><P>

the <I>proper</I>, most strictly regulated and organised distribution of bread, all kinds of food, milk, clothing, housing, etc., <I>in the interests of the poor</I>. Unless this is done, Russia <I>cannot</I> be saved from collapse and ruin. The conscientious, bold, universal move to hand over administrative work to proletarians and semi-proletarians, will, however, rouse such unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm among the people, will so multiply the people's forces in combating distress, that much that seemed impossible to our narrow, old, bureaucratic forces will become possible for the millions, who will <I>begin to work for themselves</I> and not for the capitalists, the gentry, the bureaucrats, and not out of fear of punishment.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Pertinent to the question of the state apparatus is also the question of centralism raised with unusual vehemence and ineptitude by Comrade Bazarov in <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> No. 138, of September 27, in an article entitled: "The Bolsheviks and the Problem of Power". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Comrade Bazarov reasons as follows: "The Soviets are not an apparatus suitable for all spheres of state life", for, he says, seven months' experience has shown, and "scores and hundreds of documents in the possession of the Economic Department of the St. Petersburg Executive Committee" have confirmed, that the Soviets, although actually enjoying "full power" in many places, "have not been able to achieve anything like satisfactory results in combating economic ruin". What is needed is an apparatus "divided up according to branches of production, with strict centralisation within each branch, and subordinated to one, country-wide centre". "It is a matter", if you please, "not of replacing the old apparatus, but merely of reforming it . . . no matter how much the Bolsheviks may jeer at people with a plan. . . ." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All these arguments of Comrade Bazarov's are positively amazing for their helplessness, they echo the arguments of the bourgeoigie and reflect their class point of view. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In fact, to say that the Soviets have anywhere in Russia ever enjoyed "full power" is simply ridiculous (if it is not a repetition of the selfish class lie of the capitalists). Full 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 116</B></FONT><P>

power means power over all the land, over all the banks, over all the factories; a man who is at all familiar with the facts of history and science on the connection between politics and economics could not have "forgotten" this "trifling" circumstance. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The bourgeoisie's device is to <I>withhold</I> power from the Soviets, <I>sabotage</I> every important step they take, while at the same time retaining government in their own hands, retaining power over the land, the banks, etc., and then throwing the blame for the ruin upon the Soviets! This is exactly what the whole sad experience of the coalition amounts to. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Soviets have never had full power, and the measures they have taken could not result in anything but palliatives that added to the confusion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The effort to prove the necessity for centralism to the Bolsheviks who are centralists by conviction, by their programme and by the entire tactics of their Party, is really like forcing an open door. The writers of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> are wasting their time only because they have totally failed to understand the meaning and significance of our jeers at their "country-wide" point of view. And the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> people have failed to understand this because they merely pay <I>lip-service</I> to the doctrine of the class struggle, but do not accept it seriously. Repeating the words about the class struggle they have learned by rote, they are constantly slipping into the "above-class point of view", amusing in theory and reactionary in practice, and are calling this fawning upon the bourgeoisie a "country-wide" plan. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The state, dear people, is a class concept. The state is an organ or instrument of violence exercised by one class against another. So long as it is an instrument of violence exercised by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, the proletariat can have only one slogan: <I>destruction</I> of this state. But when the state will be a proletarian state, when it will be an instrument of violence exercised by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, we shall be fully and unreservedly in favour of a strong state power and of centralism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To put it in more popular language, we do not jeer at "plans", but at Bazarov and Co.'s failure to understand that by repudiating "workers' control", by repudiating the "dictatorship of the proletariat" they <I>are for</I> the dictatorship 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 117</B></FONT><P>

of the bourgeoisie. There is no middle course; a middle course is the futile dream of the petty-bourgeois democrat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Not a single central body, not a single Bolshevik has ever argued against <I>centralisation</I> of the Soviets, against their amalgamation. None of us objects to having factory committees in each branch of production, or to their centralisation. Bazarov is <I>wide of the mark</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We laugh, have laughed, and will laugh not at "centralism", and not at "plans", but at <I>reformism</I>, because, after the experience of the coalition, your reformism is utterly ridiculous. And to say "not replace the apparatus but reform it" means to be a reformist, means to become not a revolutionary but a reformist democrat. Reformism means nothing more than concessions on the part of the ruling class, but <I>not</I> its overthrow; it makes concessions, but power remains in <I>its hands</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is precisely what has been tried during six months of the coalition. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is what we laugh at. Having failed to obtain a thorough grasp of the doctrine of the class struggle, Bazarov allows himself to be caught by the bourgeoisie who sing in chorus "Just so, just so, we are by no means opposed to reform, we are in favour of the workers participating in country-wide control, we fully agree with that", and good Bazarov <I>objectively</I> sings the descant for the capitalists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This has always been and always will be the case with people who in the thick of intense class struggle want to take up a "middle" position. And it is because-the writers of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> are incapable of understanding the class struggle that their policy is such a ridiculous and eternal oscillation between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Get busy on "plans", dear citizens, that is not politics, that is not the class struggle; here you may be of use to the people. You have many economists on your paper. Unite with those engineers and others who are willing to work on problems of regulating production and distribution; devote the centre page of your big "apparatus" (your paper) to a practical study of precise facts on the production and distribution of goods in Russia, on banks, syndicates, etc., etc. -- that is how you will be of use to the people; that is how your sitting between two stools will not be particularly 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 118</B></FONT><P>

harmful; such work on "plans" will earn not the ridicule, but the gratitude of the workers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When the proletariat is victorious it will do the following, it will set economists, engineers, agronomists, and so forth, to work <I>under the control</I> of the workers' organisations on drawing up a "plan", on verifying it, on devising labour-saving methods of centralisation, on devising the simplest, cheapest, most convenient and universal measures and methods of control. For this we shall pay the economists, statisticians and technicians good money . . . but we shall not give them anything to eat if they do not perform this work conscientiously and entirely <I>in the interests of the working people</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are in favour of centralism and of a "plan", but of the centralism and plan of the <I>proletarian</I> state, of proletarian regulation of production and distribution in the interests of the poor, the working people, the exploited, against the exploiters. We can agree to only one meaning of the term "country-wide", namely, that which breaks the resistance of the capitalists, which gives all power to the majority of the people, i.e., the proletarians and semi-proletarians, the workers and the poor peasants.

  The fifth plea is that the Bolsheviks will not be able to retain power because "the situation is exceptionally complicated". . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   0 wise men! They, perhaps, would be willing to reconcile themselves to revolution if only the "situation" were not "exceptionally complicated". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such revolutions never occur, and sighs for such a revolution amount to nothing more than the reactionary wails of a bourgeois intellectual. Even if a revolution has started in a situation that seemed to be not very complicated, the development of the revolution itself <I>always</I> creates an <I>exceptionally</I><A NAME="p118"> complicated situation. A revolution, a real, profound, a "people's" revolution, to use Marx's espression,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en57">57</A>]</FONT> is the incredibly complicated and painful process of the death of the old and birth of the new social order, of the mode of life of tens of millions of people. Revolution is a most intense, furious, desperate class struggIe and 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 119</B></FONT><P><A NAME="p119">

civil war. Not a single great revolution in history has taken place without civil war. And only a "man in a muffler"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en58">58</A>]</FONT> can think that civil war is conceivable without an "exceptionally complicated situation". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If the situation were not exceptionally complicated there would be no revolution. If you are afraid of wolves don't go into the forest. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is nothing to discuss in the fifth plea, because there is no economic, political, or any other meaning what ever in it. It contains only the yearning of people who are distressed and frightened by the revolution. To characterise this yearning I shall take the liberty of mentioning two little things from my personal experience. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I had a conversation with a wealthy engineer shortly before the July days. This engineer had once been a revolutionary, had been in the Social-Democratic movement and even a member of the Bolshevik Party. Now he was full of fear and rage at the turbulent and indomitable workers. "If they were at least like the German workers," he said (he is an educated man and has been abroad), "of course, I understand that the social revolution is, in general, inevitable, but here, when the workers' level has been so reduced by the war . . . it is not a revolution, it is an abyss." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He was willing to accept the social revolution if history were to lead to it in the peaceful, calm, smooth and precise manner of a German espress train pulling into a station. A sedate conductor would open the carriage door and announce: "Social Revolution Station! <I>Alle aussteigen!</I> (All change!)" In that case he would have no objection to changing his position of engineer under the Tit Tityches to that of engineer under the workers' organisations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That man has seen strikes. He knows what a storm of passion the most ordinary strike arouses even in the most peaceful times. He, of course, understands how many million times more furious this storm must be when the class struggle has aroused all the working people of a vast country, when war and exploitation have driven almost to desperation millions of people who for centuries have been tormented by the landowners, for decades have been robbed and downtrodden by the capitalists and the tsar's officials. He understands all this "theoretically", he only pays <I>lip-service</I> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 120</B></FONT><P>

to this, he is simply terrified by the "exceptionally complicated situation". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   After the July days, thanks to the extremely solicitous attention with which the Kerensky government honoured me, I was obliged to go underground. Of course, it was the workers who sheltered people like us. In a small working-class house in a remote working-class suburb of Petrograd, dinner is being served. The hostess puts bread on the table. The host says: "Look what fine bread. 'They' dare not give us bad bread now. And we had almost given up even thinking that we'd ever get good bread in Petrograd again." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I was amazed at this class appraisal of the July days. My thoughts had been revolving around the political significance of those events, weighing the role they played in the general course of events, analysing the situation that caused this zigzag in history and the situation it would create, and how we ought to change our slogans and alter our Party apparatus to adapt it to the changed situation. As for bread, I, who had not known want, did not give it a thought. I took bread for granted, as a by-product of the writer's work, as it were. The mind approaches the foundation of everything, the class struggle for bread, through political analysis that follows an extremely complicated and devious path. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This member of the oppressed class, however, even though one of the well-paid and quite intelligent workers, takes the bull by the horns with that astonishing simplicity and straightforwardness, with that firm determination and amazing clarity of outlook from which we intellectuals are as remote as the stars in the sky. The whole world is divided into two camps: "us", the working people, and "them", the exploiters. Not a shadow of embarrassment over what had taken place; it was just one of the battles in the long struggle between labour and capital. When you fell trees, chips fly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "What a painful thing is this 'exceptionally complicated situation' created by the revolution," that's how the bourgeois intellectual thinks and feels. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "We squeezed 'them' a bit; 'they' won't dare to lord it over us as they did before. We'll squeeze again -- and chuck them out altogether," that's how the worker thinks and feels.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The sixth and last plea: the proletariat "will be incapable of resisting all the pressure by hostile forces that will sweep away not only the proletarian dictatorship, but the entire revolution into the bargain". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Don't try to scare us, gentlemen, you won't succeed. We saw these hostile forces and their pressure in Kornilovism (from which the Kerensky regime in no way differs). Everybody saw, and the people remember, how the proletariat and the poor peasants swept away the Kornilov gang, and how pitiful and helpless proved to be the position of the supporters of the bourgeoisie and of the few exception ally well-to-do local small landowners who were exceptionally "hostile" to the revolution. <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> of September 30 urges the workers to "be patient and put up with" Kerensky (i.e., Kornilov) and the fake Tsereteli Bulygin Duma until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly (convened under the protection of "military measures" against insurgent peasants!) and, with great gusto, it repeats precisely <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>'s sixth plea and shouts until it is hoarse: "The Kerensky government will under no circumstances submit" (to the rule of the Soviets, the rule of the workers and peasants, which <I>Dyelo Naroda</I>, not wishing to lag behind the pogrom-mongers and anti-Semites, monarchists and Cadets, calls the rule of "Trotsky and Lenin": these are the lengths to which the Socialist-Revolutionaries go!). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But neither <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> nor <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> can scare the class-conscious workers. "The Kerensky government," you say, "will under no circumstances submit", i.e., it will repeat the Kornilov revolt, to put it more simply, bluntly and clearly. And the gentlemen of <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> dare to say that this will be "civil war", that this is a "horrible prospect"! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No, gentlemen, you will not fool the workers. It will not be civil war but a hopeless revolt of a handful of Kornilovites. If they want to "refuse to submit" to the people and at all costs provoke a repetition on a wide scale of what happened to the Kornilov men in Vyborg -- <I>if</I> that is what the Socialist-Revolutionaries <I>want</I>, if that is what the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 122</B></FONT><P>

member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party Kerensky wants, he may drive the people to desperation. But you will not scare the workers and soldiers with this, gentlemen. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What boundless insolence. They faked up a new Bulygin Duma; by means of fraud they recruited a crowd of reactionary co-operators and village kulaks to help them, added to these the capitalists and landowners (the so-called property owning classes) and with the aid of this gang of Kornilovites they want <I>to thwart the will of the people</I>, the will of the workers and peasants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   They have brought affairs in a peasant country to such a pass that peasant revolt is spreading everywhere like a river in flood! Think of it! In a democratic republic in which 80 per cent of the population are peasants, the peasants have been driven to revolt. . . . This same <I>Dyelo Naroda</I>, Chernov's newspaper, the organ of the "Socialist-Revolutionary" Party, which on September 30 has the effrontery to advise the workers and peasants to "be patient", was obliged to admit in a leading article on September 29: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>So far practically nothing</I> has been done to put an end to those relations of bondage that still <I>prevail</I> in the villages of central Russia." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This same <I>Dyelo Naroda</I>, in the same leading article of September 29, says that "the dead hand of Stolypin is still making itself strongly felt" in the methods employed by the "revolutionary ministers"; in other words, putting it more clearly and simply, it brands Kerensky, Nikitin, Kishkin and Co. as <I>Stolypins</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The "Stolypins" Kerensky and Co. have driven the peasants to revolt, are now taking "military measures" against the peasants, are trying to soothe the people with the convocation of the Constituent Assembly (although Kerensky and Tsereteli have already <I>deceived</I> the people once by solemnly proclaiming on July 8 that the Constituent Assembly would be convened on the appointed date, September 17; they then <I>broke their promise</I> and postponed the Constituent Assembly even against the advice of the <I>Menshevik Dan</I>, postponed the Constituent Assembly not to the end of October as the Menshevik Central Executive Committee of that time wished, but to the end of November). The "Stolypins" Kerensky and Co. are trying to soothe the people 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 123</B></FONT><P>

with the imminent convocation of the Constituent Assembly, as if the people can believe those who have already lied in this matter, as if the people can believe that the Constituent Assembly will be <I>properly</I> convened by a government which has taken <I>military measures</I> in remote villages, that is to say, is openly conniving at the arbitrary arrest of class-conscious peasants and the <I>rigging</I> of the elections. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The government has driven the peasants to revolt and now has the effrontery to say to them: "You must 'be patient', you must wait, trust the government which is pacifying in surgent peasants by 'military measures'!" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To bring matters to such a pitch that hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers perish in the offensive after June 19, the war is being protracted, German sailors have mutinied and are throwing their officers overboard, to bring matters to such a pitch, all the time uttering phrases about peace but <I>not offering</I> a just peace to all the belligerents, and yet to have the effrontery to tell the workers and peasants, to tell the dying soldiers, "you must be patient", trust the government of the "Stolypin man" Kerensky, trust the Kornilov generals for another month, perhaps in that month they will send several tens of thousands more soldiers to the slaughter. . . . "You must be patient". . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Isn't that shameless? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But you won't fool the soldiers, gentlemen of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kerensky's fellow party members. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The workers and soldiers will not endure the Kerensky government for a single day, for an <I>extra</I> hour, for they know that the <I>Soviet</I> Government will <I>immediately</I> offer all the belligerents a just peace and therefore will <I>in all probability</I> achieve an immediate armistice and a speedy peace. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Not for a single day, not for an eltra hour will the soldiers of our peasant army allow the Kerensky government -- the government which is employing <I>military measures</I> to suppress the peasant revolt -- to remain in power against the will of the Soviets. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No, gentlemen of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kerensky's fellow party members, you won't fool the workers and peasants any more.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  On the question of the pressure by hostile forces which the mortally frightened <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> assures us will sweep away the proletarian dictatorship, still another monstrous logical and political mistake is made, which only people who have allowed themselves to be frightened out of their wits can fail to see. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Pressure by hostile forces will sweep away the proletarian dictatorship," you say. Very well. But you are all economists and educated people, dear fellow-citizens. You al] know that to contrast democracy to the hourgeoisie is senseless and a sign of ignorance; it is the same as contrasting pounds to yards, for there is a democratic bourgeoisie and undemocratic groups of the petty bourgeoisie (capable of raising a Vend&eacutee). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Hostile forces" is merely an empty phrase. The class term is <I>bourgeoisie</I> (backed by the landowners). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The bourgeoisie and the landowners, the proletariat, and the petty bourgeoisie, the small proprietors, primarily the peasants -- these are the three main "forces" into which Russia, like <I>every</I> capitalist country, is divided. These are the three main "forces" that have long been revealed in every capitalist country (including Russia) not only by scientific economic analysis, but also by the <I>political experience</I> of the modern history of <I>all</I> countries, by the experience of <I>all</I> European revolutions since the eighteenth century, by the experience of the two Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   So, you threaten the proletariat with the prospect that its rule will be swept away by the pressure of the bourgeoisie? That, and that alone, is what your threat amounts to, it has no other meaning. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Very well. If, for example, the bourgeoisie can sweep away the rule of the workers and poor peasants, then the only alternative is a "coalition", i.e., an alliance, or agreement, between the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie. Nothing else can be contemplated! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But coalition has heen tried for about six months and it has led to bankruptcy, and you yourselves, my dear but dense citizens of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>, have <I>renounced</I> coalition. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   So what do we get? 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 125</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  You have become so muddled, citizens of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>, you have allowed yourselves to be so scared, that you cannot think straight in the extremely simple matter of <I>counting even up to three</I>, <I>let alone up to five</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Either all power to the bourgeoisie -- the slogan you have long ceased to advocate, and which the bourgeoisie themselves dare not even hint at, for they know that the people overthrew this power with one hitch of the shoulder at the time of the April 20-21 events, and would overthrow it now with thrice that determination and ruthlessness; or power to the petty bourgeoisie, i.e., a coalition (alliance, agreement) between them and the bourgeoisie, for the petty bourgeoisie do not wish to and <I>cannot</I> take power alone and independently, as has been proved by the experience of all revolutions, and as is proved by economics, which explains that in a capitalist country it is possible to stand for capital and it is possible to stand for labour, but it is impossible to stand for long in between. In Russia this coalition has for six months tried scores of ways and failed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Or, finally, all power to the proletarians and the poor peasants against the bourgeoisie in order to break their resistance. This has not yet been tried, and you, gentlemen of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>, are <I>dissuading</I> the people from this, you are trying to frighten them with your own fear of the bourgeoisie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No fourth way can be invented. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>, therefore, is afraid of the proletarian dictatorship and rejects it because, as it claims, the proletarian power may be defeated by the bourgeoisie, it is tantamount to its <I>surreptitiously reverting</I> to the position of <I>compromise</I> with the capitalists! It is as clear as daylight, that whoever is afraid of resistance, whoever does not believe that it is possible to break this resistance, whoever warns the people: "beware of the resistance of the capitalists, you will not be able to cope with it", is <I>thereby</I> again calling for compromise with the capitalists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> is hopelessly and pitifully muddled, as are all the petty-bourgeois democrats who now realise that the coalition is bankrupt, dare not defend it openly and, at the same time, protected by the bourgeoisie, fear the transfer of all power to the proletarians and poor peasants.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  To fear the resistance of the capitalists and yet to call oneself a revolutionary, to wish to be regarded as a socialist -- isn't that disgraceful? How low must international socialism, corrupted by opportunism, have fallen ideologically if such voices <I>could</I> be raised? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have already seen the strength of the capitalists' resistance; the entire people have seen it, for the capitalists are more class-conscious than the other classes and at once realised the significance of the Soviets, at once exerted <I>all their efforts</I> to the utmost, resorted to everything, went to all lengths, resorted to the most incredible lies and slander, to military plots <I>in order to frustrate the Soviets</I>, to reduce them to nought, to prostitute them (with the aid of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries), to transform them into talking-shops, to wear down the peasants and workers by months and months of empty talk and playing at revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>We have not yet seen</I>, however, the strength of resistance of the proletarians and poor peasants, for this strength will become fully apparent only when power is in the hands of the proletariat, when tens of millions of people who have been crushed by want and capitalist slavery see from experience and <I>feel</I> that state power has passed into the hands of the oppressed classes, that the state is helping the poor to fight the landowners and capitalists, is <I>breaking</I> their resistance. <I>Only</I> then shall we see what untapped forces of resistance to the capitalists<A NAME="p126"> are latent among the people; only then will what Engels called "latent socialism"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en59">59</A>]</FONT> manifest itself. Only then, for every <I>ten thousand</I> overt and concealed enemies of working-class rule, manifesting themselves actively or by passive resistance, there will arise <I>a million</I> new fighters who had been politically dormant, writhing in the torments of poverty and despair, having ceased to believe that they were human, that they had the right to live, that they too could be served by the entire might of the modern centralised state, that contin gents of the proletarian militia could, with the fullest confidence, also call upon <I>them</I> to take a direct, immediate, daily part in state administration. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 127</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The capitalists and landowners, with the kind help of Plekhanov, Breshkovskaya, Tsereteli, Chernov and Co., have done <I>everything</I> in their power to defile the democratic republic, to <I>defile</I> it by servility to wealth to such a degree that the people are being overcome by apathy, indifference; <I>it is all the same to them</I>, because the hungry man cannot see the difference between the republic and the monarchy; the freezing, barefooted, worn-out soldier sacrificing his life for alien interests is not inclined to love the republic. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But when every labourer, every unemployed worker, every cook, every ruined peasant sees, not from the newspapers, but with his own eyes, that the proletarian state is not cringing to wealth but is helping the poor, that this state does not hesitate to adopt revolutionary measures, that it confiscates surplus stocks of provisions from the parasites-and distributes them to the hungry, that it forcibly installs the homeless in the houses of the rich, that it compels the rich to pay for milk but doesnot give them a drop until the children of <I>all</I> poor families are sufficiently supplied, that the land is being transferred to the working people and the factories and banks are being placed under the control of the workers, and that immediate and severe punishment is meted out to the millionaires who conceal their wealth -- when the poor see and feel this, no capitalist or kulak forces, no forces of world finance capital which manipulates thousands of millions, will vanquish the people's revolution; on the contrary, <I>the socialist revolution</I> will triumph all over the world for it is maturing in all countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our revolution will be invincible if it is not afraid of itself, if it transfers all power to the proletariat, for behind us stand the immeasurably larger, more developed, more organised world forces of the proletariat which are temporarily held down by the war but not destroyed; on the contrary, the war has multiplied them.

  How can one be afraid that the Bolshevik government, that is to say, the proletarian government, which is assured of the devoted support of the poor peasants, will be "swept away" by the capitalist gentlemen! What short 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 128</B></FONT><P>

sightedness! What disgraceful fear of the people! What hypocrisy! Those who show this fear belong to that "high" (by capitalist standards, but actually <I>rotten </I>) "society" which utters the word "justice" without believing in it, from habit, as a trite phrase, attaching no meaning to it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Here is an example. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Mr. Peshekhonov is a well-known semi-Cadet. A more moderate Trudovik, one of the same mind as the Breshkovskayas and Plekhanovs, will not be found. There has never been a minister more servile to the bourgeoisie. The world had never seen a more ardent advocate of "coalition", of compromise with the capitalists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Here are the admissions this gentleman-was <I>forced</I> to make in his speech at the "Democratic" (read: Bulygin) Conference as reported by the defencist <I>Izvestia </I>: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "There are two programmes. One is the programme of group claims, class and national claims. This programme is most frankly advocated by the Bolsheviks. It is not easy, however, for the other sections of the democracy to reject this programme. They are the claims of the working people, the claims of the cheated and oppressed nationalities. It is not so easy, therefore, for the democracy to break with the Bolsheviks, to reject these class demands, primarily because in essence these demands are just. But this programme, for which we fought before the revolution, for the sake of which we made the revolution, and which we would all unanimously support under other circumstances, constitutes a very grave danger under present conditions. The danger is all the greater now because these demands have to be presented at a time when it is impossible for the state to comply with them. We must first defend the whole -- the state, to save it from doom, and there is only one way to do that, not the satisfaction of demands, however just and cogent they may be, but, on the contrary, restriction and sacrrifice, which must be contributed from all quarters. (<I>Izvestia</I>, September 17.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Mr. Peshekhonov fails to understand that as long as the capitalists are in power he is defending <I>not</I> the whole, but the selfish interests of Russian and "Allied" imperialist capital. Mr. Peshekhonov fails to understand that the war would cease to be an imperialist, predatory war of annexation only after a rupture with the capitalists, with <I>their</I> secret treaties, with <I>their</I> annexations (seizure of alien territory), with <I>their</I> banking and financial swindles. Mr.Peshekhonov fails to understand that only <I>after</I> this would the war become -- if the enemy rejected the formal offer of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 129</B></FONT><P>

a just peace -- a defensive war, a just war. Mr. Peshekhonov fails to understand that the defence potential of a country that has thrown off the yoke of capital, that has given the peasants land and has placed the banks and factories under workers' control, would be <I>many times</I> greater than the defence potential of a capitalist country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The main tbing that. Mr. Peshekhonov <I>fails</I> to understand is that he <I>surrenders</I> his entire position, the entire position of the entire petty-bourgeois democrac'y when he is forced to admit the justice of Bolshevism, to admit that its demands are the demands of the "<I>working people </I>", i.e., of the majority of the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This is where our strength lies. This is why our government will be invincible; because even our opponents are forced to admit that the Bolshevik programme is that of the "working people" and the "oppressed nationalities". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   After all, Mr. Peshekhonov is the political friend of the Cadets, of the Yedinstvo and <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> people, of the Breshkovskayas and Plekhanovs, he is the representative of the kulaks and of the gentlemen whose wives and sisters would come tomorrow to gouge out with their umbrellas the eyes of wounded Bolsheviks if they were to be defeated by Kornilov's or (which is the same thing) Kerensky's troops. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A gentleman like that is <I>forced</I> to admit the "justice" of the Bolshevik demands. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For him "justice" is merely an empty phrase. For the mass of semi-proletarians, however, and for the majority of the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie who have been ruined, tortured and worn out by the war, it is not an empty phrase, but a most acute, most burning and immense question of death from starvation, of a crust of bread. That is why <I>no</I> policy can be based on a "coalition", on a "compromise" between the interests of the starving and ruined and the interests of the explolters. That is why the Bolshevik government is <I>assured</I> of the support of the overwhelming majority of <I>these</I> people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Justice is an empty word, say the intellectuals and those rascals who are inclined to proclaim themselves Marxists on the lofty grounds that they have "contemplated the <I>hind parts </I>" of economic materialism. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 130</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Ideas become a power when they grip the people. And precisely at the present time the Bolsheviks, i.e., the representatives of revolutionary proletarian internationalism, have embodied in their policy the idea that is motivating countless working people all over the world. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Justice alone, the mere anger of the people against exploitation, would never have brought them on to the true path of socialism. But now that, thanks to capitalism, the material apparatus of the big banks, syndicates, railways, and so forth, has grown, now that the immense experience of the advanced countries has accumulated a stock of engineering marvels, the employment of which is being <I>hindered</I> by capitalism, now that the class-conscious workers have built up a party of a quarter of a million members to systematically lay hold of this apparatus and set it in motion with the support of all the working and exploited people -- now that these conditions exist, no power on earth can prevent the Bolsheviks, <I>if they do not allow themselves to be scared</I> and if they succeed in taking power, from retaining it until the triumph of the world socialist revolution.

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The foregoing lines were already written when the leading article in <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> of October 1 produced another gem of stupidity which is all the more dangerous because it professes sympathy with the Bolsheviks and offers most sagacious philistine admonitions "not to allow yourselves to be provoked" (not to allow ourselves to be caught in the trap of screams about provocation, the object of which is to frighten the Bolsheviks and cause them to <I>refrain</I> from taking power).  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Here is this gem: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The lessons of movements, like that of July 3-5, on the one hand, and of the Kornilov days, on the other, have shown quite clearly that the democracy, having at its command organs that exercise immense influence among the population, is invincible when it takes a defensive position in civil war, and that it suffers defeat, loses all the middle vacillating groups when it takes the initiative and launches an offensive ." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If the Bolsheviks were to yield in any form and in the slightest degree to the philistine stupidity of this argument they would ruin their Party and the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    For the author of this argument, taking it upon himself to talk about civil war (just the subject for a lady with many good points), has distorted <I>the lessons of history</I> on this question in an incredibly comical manner. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This is how <I>these</I> lessons, the lessons of history on <I>this</I> question, were treated by the representative and founder of proletarian revolutionary tactics, Karl Marx: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp

   "Now, insurrection is an art quite as much as war or any other art, and is subject to certain procedural rules

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 132</B></FONT><P>

which, when neglected, will bring about the downfall of the party neglecting them. These rules, logical deductions from the nature of the parties and the circumstances you have to deal with in such a case, are so plain and simple that the brief experience of 1848 made the Germans fairly well acquainted with them. Firstly, never play with insurrection unless you are fully prepared to go the whole way [literally: face the consequences of your game].<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#fnp132">*</A>]</FONT> "Insurrection is an equation with very indefinite magnitudes, the value of which may change every day; the forces opposed to you have all the advantage of organisation, discipline and habitual authority [Marx has in mind the most "difficult" case of insurrection: against the "firmly established" old authority, against the army not yet disintegrated by the influence of the revolution and the vacillation of the government]; unless you bring strong odds against them you are defeated and ruined. Secondly, once you have entered upon the insurrectionary career, act with the greatest determination, and on the offensive. The defensive is the death of every armed rising; it is lost before it measures itself with its enemies. Surprise your antagonists while their forces are scattered, prepare the way for new successes, however small, but prepare daily; keep up the moral superiority which the first successful rising has given to you; rally in this way those vacillating elements to your side which always follow the strongest impulse and which always look out for the safer side; force your enemies to retreat before they can collect their strength against you; in the words of Danton, the greatest master of revolutionary tactics yet known: <I>de l'audace</I>, <I>de l'audace</I>, <I>encore de l'audace! </I>" (<I>Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</I>, German edition, 1907, p. 118.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We have changed all that, the "would-be Marxists" of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> may say about themselves;<A NAME="p132"> instead of triple audacity they have two virtues: "We have two, sir: moderation and accuracy."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en60">60</A>]</FONT> For "us", the experience of world history, the experience of the Great French Revolution, is

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 133</B></FONT><P>

nothing. The important thing for "us" is the experience of the two movements in 1917, distorted by Molchalin spectacles. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us examine this experience without these charming spectacles. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You compare July 3-5 with "civil war", because you believed Alexinsky, Pereverzev and Co. It is typical of the gentlemen of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> that they believe <I>such</I> people (and do absolutely nothing themselves to <I>collect information</I> about July 3-5, although they have the huge apparatus of a big daily newspaper at their disposal). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us assume for a moment, however, that July 3-5 was not the rudiment of civil war that was kept within the rudimentary stage by the Bolsheviks, but actual civil war. Let us assume this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In that case, then, what does this lesson prove? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   First, the Bolsheviks did <I>not</I> take the offensive, for it is indisputable that on the night of July 3-4, and even on July 4, they would have gained a great deal if they had taken the offensive. Their defensive position was their weakness, if we are to speak of civil war (as <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> does, and not of converting a spontaneous outburst into a demonstration of the type of April 20-21, as the <I>facts</I> show). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "lesson" therefore proves that the wise men of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> are <I>wrong</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Secondly, if the Bolsheviks did not even set out to start an insurrection on July 3 or 4, if <I>not a single</I> Bolshevik <I>body</I> even raised such a question, the reason for it lies <I>beyond</I> the scope of our controversy with <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>. For we are arguing about the <I>lessons</I> of "civil war", i.e., of insurrection, and not about the point that obvious lack of a majority to support it restrains the revolutionary party from thinking of insurrection. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Since everybody knows that the Bolsheviks received a majority in the metropolitan Soviets and in the country (over 49 per cent of the Moscow votes) <I>much later</I> than July 1917, it again follows that the "lessons" are far, far from what <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>, that lady with many good points, would like them to be. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No, no, you had better not meddle with politics, citizens of <I>Novaya Zhizn </I>! 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 134</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  If the revolutionary party has no majority in the advanced contingents of the revolutionary classes and in the country, insurrection is out of the question. Moreover, insurrection requires: (1) growth of the revolution on a country-wide scale; (2) the complete moral and political bankruptcy of the old government, for example, the "coalition" government; (3) extreme vacillation in the camp of all middle groups, i.e., those who do not fully support the government, although they did fully support it yesterday. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Why did <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>, when speaking of the "lessons" of July 3-5, fail even to note this very important lesson? Because a political question was not dealt with by politicians but by a circle of intellectuals who had been terrified by the bourgeoisie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To proceed. Thirdly, the facts show that it was <I>after</I> July 3-4 that the rot set in among the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, precisely because the Tseretelis had <I>exposed</I> themselves by their <I>July</I> policy, precisely because the mass of the <I>people</I> realised that the Bolsheviks were <I>their own</I> front-rank fighters and that the "social-bloc" advocates were traitors. <I>Even before</I> the Kornilov revolt this rot was fully revealed by the Petrograd elections on August 20, which resulted in a victory for the Bolsheviks and the rout of the "social-bloc" advocates (<I>Dyelo Naroda</I> recently tried to refute this <I>by concealing</I> the returns for all parties, but this was both self-deception and deception of its readers; according to the figures published in <I>Dyen</I> of August 24, covering only the city, the Cadets' share of the total vote increased from 22 to 23 per cent, but the absolute number of votes cast for the Cadets dropped 40 per cent; the Bolsheviks' share of the total vote increased from 20 to 33 per cent, while the absolute number of votes cast for the Bolsheviks dropped only 10 per cent; the share of all "middle groups" dropped from 58 to 44 per cent, but the absolute number of votes cast for them dropped 60 per cent!). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That a rot had set in among the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks after the July days and before the Kornilov days is also proved by the growth of the Left wings in both parties, reaching almost 40 per cent: this is "retribution" for the persecution of the Bolsheviks by the Kerenskys. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 135</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  In spite of the "loss" of a few hundred members, the proletarian party <I>gained</I> enormously from July 3-4, for it was precisely during those stern days that the <I>people</I> realised and saw its devotion and the <I>treachery</I> of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. So, the "lesson" is far, very far from being of the <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> sort, it is one entirely different, namely: don't desert the seething masses for the "Molchalins of democracy"; and if you launch an insurrection, go over to the offensive while the enemy forces are scattered, catch the enemy unawares. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is that not so, gentlemen "would-be Marxists" of <I>Novaya Zhizn </I>? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Or does "Marxism" mean not basing tactics on an exact appraisal of the <I>objective</I> situation but senseless]y and uncritically lumping together "civil war" and "a Congress of Soviets and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But this is simply ridiculous, gentlemen, this is a sheer mockery of Marxism and of logic in general! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If there is <I>nothing</I> in the <I>objective</I> situation that warrants the intensification of the class struggle to the point of "civil war", why did you speak of "civil war" <I>in connection</I> with "a Congress of Soviets and the Constituent Assembly"? (For this is the title of the leading article in <I>Novaya Zhizn</I> here under discussion.) In that case you should clearly have told the reader and proved to him that there is <I>no</I> ground in the objective situation for civil war and that, therefore, peaceful, constitutionally-legal, juridically and parliamentarily "sirnple" things like a Congress of Soviets and a Constituent Assembly can and should be the cornerstone of tactics. In that case it is <I>possible</I> to hold the opinion that such a congress and such an assembly are really capable <I>of making decisions</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If, however, the present objective conditions harbour the inevitability or even only the probability of civil war, if you did not "idly" speak about it, but did so clearly seeing, feeling, sensing the existence of a situation of civil war, how could you make a Congress of Soviets or a Constituent Assembly the cornerstone? This is a sheer mockery of the starving and tormented people! Do you think the starving will consent to "wait" two months? Or that the ruin, about the increase of which you yourselves write every day, will  

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 136</B></FONT><P>

consent to "wait" for the Congress of Soviets or for the Constituent Assembly? Or that the German offensive, in the absence of serious steps on our part towards peace (i.e., in the absence of a formal offer of a just peace to all belligerents), will consent to "wait" for the Congress of Soviets or for the Constituent Assembly? Or are you in possession of facts which permit you to conclude that the history of the Russian revolution,<A NAME="p136"> which from February 28 to September 30 had proceeded with extraordinary turbulence and unprecedented rapidity, will, from October 1 to November 29,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en61">61</A>]</FONT> proceed at a super-tranquil, peaceful, legally balanced pace that will preclude upheavals, spurts, military defeats and economic crises? Or will the army at the front, concerning which the <I>non</I>-Bolshevik officer Dubasov said officially, in the name of the front, "it will not fight", quietly starve and freeze until the "appointed" date? Or will the peasant ravolt cease to be a factor of civil war because you call it "anarchy" and "pogrom", or because Kerensky will send "military" forces <I>against the peasants </I>? Or is it possible, <I>conceivable</I>, that the government can work calmly, honestly, and <I>without</I> deception to convene the Constituent Assembly in a <I>peasant</I> country when that same government is <I>suppressing</I> the peasant revolt? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp<A NAME="p136a">
    Don't laugh at the "confusion in the Smolny Institute",<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="RSP17.html#en62">62</A>]</FONT> gentlemen! There is no less confusion in your own ranks. You answer the formidable questions of civil war with confused phrases and pitiful constitutional illusions. That is why I say that if the Bolsheviks were to give in to these moods they would ruin both their Party and their revolution.

   Written at Vyborg in late September-October 1 (14), 1917. First published in the magazine <I>Prosveshcheniye</I> (<I>Education </I>) No. 1-2 for October 1917. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Prosveshcheniye</I>, a monthly Bolshevik theoretical journal legally published in Petersburg from December 1911 to June 1914. It had a peak circulation of 5,000. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   It was put out on Lenin's suggestion, and contained contributions from Vorovsky, Ulyanova-Yelizarova, Krupskaya, Olminsky and others. Gorky edited the <I>belle lettres</I> section. Lenin directed its policy from Paris and then from Cracow and Poronin; he edited some of the articles and kept up a regular correspondence with members of the editorial board.

The magazine exposed opportunists -- liquidators, otzovists and Trotskyites -- and also bourgeois nationalists, and reported on the working-class struggle at the time of the new revolutionary upsurge; it popularised Bolshevik slogans in the electoral campaign for the Fourth Duma and opposed revisionism and centrism in the parties of the Second International. It had a great part to play in educating forward-looklng workers in Russia in the Marxist international spirit.

   On the eve of the First World War, in June 1914 it was closed down by the tsarist government, and resumed publication in the autumn of 1917, but only one double issue was put out.

   This happened on June 4 (17), 1917, during a speech of the Menshevik Tsereteli, a Minister of the Provisional Government, who had said that there was no political party in Russia which was prepared to take full power in the country. On behalf of the Bolshevik Party, Lenin interrupted Tsereteli with the remark: "There is!" In his speech from the rostrum later, Lenin declared that the Bolshevik Party "is ready to take over full power at any moment" (see Vol. 25, p. 20).
