                         EXPOSURE OF THE BRITISH OPPORTUNISTS<P><BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  A Parliamentary by-election recently took place in Leicester, England.   This election is of enormous importance in principle, and every socialist interested in the very important question of the attitude of the proletariat towards the liberal bourgeoisie in general, and the British socialist movement in particular, should ponder deeply over the Leicester election. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Leicester is a <I>two</I>-member constituency and each elector has two votes. There are only a few constituencies of this kind in Britain, but they particularly favour a tacit <I>bloc</I> between the Socialists and the Liberals, as is emphasised by the correspondent in Britain of the <I>Leipziger Volkszeitung.</I> It was precisely in such constituencies that the most prominent of the leaders of the so-called Independent (independent of socialism, but dependent on liberalism) Labour Party were elected to Parliament. The I.L.P. leaders, Keir Hardie, Philip Snowdell and Ramsay MacDonald, were returned by such constituencies. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And in these constituencies the Liberals, who are in the ascendancy, call on their supporters to cast one vote for the Socialist and one for the Liberal, provided, of course, that the Socialist is a "reasonable", moderate, "independent" one and not an irreconcilable Social-Democrat, whom the British Liberals and liquidators, no less than the Russian, know how to curse as an anarcho-syndicalist, etc.! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What actually takes place, therefore, is the formation of a bloc between the Liberals and the moderate, opportunist Socialists. Actually, the British "independents" (for whom our liquidators express such tender feelings) <I>depend</I> on the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 273</B></FONT><P>

Liberals. The conduct of the "independents" in the British Parliament constantly confirms this dependence. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It happened that the I.L.P. member for Leicester, none other than the party leader, MacDonald, resigned for personal reasons. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What was to be done? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Liberals, of course, put forward their candidate. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Leicester is a factory town with a predominantly proletarian population. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The local I.L.P. organisation called a conference which by 67 votes against 8 decided <I>to put forward a candidate.</I> No sooner said than done. Banton, a Town Councillor and prominent member of the I.L.P., was nominated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Then the Executive Committee of this Party, which as signs the money for the election campaign (and elections in Britain are very costly!), <I>refused</I> to endorse Banton's candidature! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The opportunist Executive Committee opposed the local workers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Leicester branch of the other British socialist party, which is not opportunist and is <I>really</I> independent of the Liberals, then sent its representative to the Leicester I.L.P. and invited them to support <I>its</I> candidate, Hartley, a member of the British Socialist Party, a very popular figure in the labour movement, an ex-member of the Independent Labour Party, who left it because of its opportunism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The members of the Leicester branch of the I.L.P. were in an awkward position: they were heart and soul in favour of Hartley, but . . . but what of the discipline in their party, the decision of their Executive Committee? The Leicester people found a way out: they closed the meeting, and <I>each in his private capacity</I> declared for Hartley. Next day a huge meeting of workers endorsed Hartley's candidature; Banton himself sent a telegram stating that he would vote for Hartley. The Leicester trade unions declared for Hartley. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The I.L.P. Parliamentary group intervened and published <I>a protest</I> in the <I>Liberal</I> press (which, like our <I>Rech</I> and <I>Sovremenka</I>, helps the opportunists) against Hartley's candidature, against "undermining" MacDonald!

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 274</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The election, of course, resulted in a victory for the Liberals. They obtained 10,863 votes, the Conservatives 9,279, and Hartley 2,580. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Class-conscious workers in various countries quite often adopt a "tolerant" attitude toward the British I.L.P. This is a great mistake. The <I>betrayal</I> of the workers' cause in Leicester by the I.L.P. is no accident, but the result of the entire opportunist policy of the Independent Labour Party. The sympathies of all real Social-Democrats should be with those British Social-Democrats who are determinedly combating the Liberal corruption of the workers by the "Independent Labour Party in Britain.
