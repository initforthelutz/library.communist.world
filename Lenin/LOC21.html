&nbsp;<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  We are in receipt of replies to the Political Bureau's query concerning oil concessions both from Krasin (and Bogdatyan) and Chairman of Glavneft<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LOC21.html#fnp134">*</A>]</FONT> Dosser and his four experts. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In connection with the report, <I>The State of the Oil Industry by the End of 1920</I> (Baku, 1920), I am sending these replies on to Comrade Stalin, and request all members of the Political Bureau to ring him up to obtain all this materia] and read it in good time. (All you have to do with regard to the printed report is to read through what I have marked off with a blue pencil on the pages listed on the cover, that is, on the page before the text.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This material needs to be read urgently, because it is desirable to have a Political Bureau decision (8.00 p.m . Monday, February 14). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The material gives ample proof that: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (a)&nbsp; disaster is <I>imminent </I>; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (b)&nbsp; everything must be done to lease out the concessions in Baku (that is, find the concessionaires); 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (c)&nbsp; the Glavneft Chairman is extremely stupid. Stupidity in such high quarters is a menace. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   These three points summed up: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (a) Disaster is looming. This point is driven home <I>by the Glavneft experts.</I> The fool Dosser tries to <I>mi-</I>

<A NAME="fnp134">

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 135</B></FONT><P>

<I>nimise</I> the danger in his "memo". That is the height of stupidity. The opinions of all the Glavneft <I>experts</I> should be read and compared with Dosser's toned-down conclusion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (b) Dosser formulates his conclusion as follows: "There is doubtful benefit in inviting a concessionaire." It looks as though he has, like the truly well-intentioned fool that he is, scared his experts into believing that an anti-concession stand is the only decent one to take for a "Soviet" citizen. That's a really "good turn" he has done us! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the practical plane, the reports of the Glavneft experts (which are business-like and are strictly borne out by the "end of 1920" printed report) clarify <I>the kind of terms</I> we should lay down for the concessionaire. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is, of course, "doubtful" whether a concessionaire can be found on these terms. But no politician in his right mind would consult Dosser or the experts on that. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is up to us to make every effort to find such concessionaires. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If we don't, so much the worse for us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If we fail to make an all-out effort to find a concessionaire, we shall find ourselves bankrupt. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The working out of the terms must be speeded up. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   An immediate start must be made in fighting a highly dangerous prejudice which could easily carry a section of the workers and which must be debunked at any cost. It is this "idea": "We don't want to work for the capitalists", or its variant, "We don't want to work for the capitalists when workers nearby are not doing it". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The harm of it (refuted by the R.C.P. Programme and Marxism in general) is evident from this rough calculation, which epitomises the conclusion given in the experts' reports. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are extracting 100<I>a</I> of oil. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Output is dropping. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Flooding threatens disaster. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If we get a concessionaire, who will help to extract 100<I>a</I> + 100<I>b</I> of oil, and if we have to pay him 98<I>b</I> for this, our output will rise, instead of dropping, even if ever so slowly (100<I>a</I> + 2<I>b </I>). 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 136</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Here is the question: are the workers who give the concessionaire 98<I>b</I> out of the 100<I>b</I> working for "the capitalists" or for the Soviet power? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is no difficulty about the answer. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Please go over the enclosed material and reports urgently, to allow us to take a decision as soon as possible. There is extreme danger in any delay.
