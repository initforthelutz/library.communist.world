  To the socialist it is not the horrors of war that are the hardest to endure -- we are always for "<I>santa guerra di tutti gli oppressi per la conquista delle</I> loro <I>patrie! </I>"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#fnp20">*</A>]</FONT> -- but the horrors of the treachery shown by the leaders of present day socialism, the horrors of the collapse of the present-day International. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is it not treachery to Social-Democracy when we see the German socialists' amazing change of front (after Germany's declaration of war); the false phrases about a war of liberation against tsarism; forgetfulness of German imperialism, forgetfulness of the rape of Serbia; the bourgeois interests involved in the war against Britain, etc., etc.? Chauvinist patriots vote for the Budget! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Have the socialists of France and Belgium not shown the same kind of treachery? They are excellent at exposing German imperialism, but, unfortunately they are amazingly purblind with regard to British, French, and particularly the barbarous Russian imperialism. They fail to see the disgraceful fact that, for decades on end, the French bourgeoisie have been paying out thousands of millions for the hire of the Black-Hundred gangs of Russian tsarism, and that the latter has been crushing the non-Russian majority in our country, robbing Po]and, oppressing the Great Russian workers and peasants, and so on.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp

told the German socialists, namely, that they are <I>imperialists</I>, i.e., chauvinists. One feels even more refreshed on reading the article by Zibordi (<I>Avanti!</I>, Sept. 2) exposing not only the German and the Austrian brands of chauvinism (which is to the advantage of the <I>Italian</I> bourgeoisie), but also the <I>French</I>, an article which shows that this war is a war of the bourgeoisie of all lands! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Avanti!</I>'s stand and the Zibordi article -- [as well as the resolution of the group of revolutionary Social-Democrats (at a recent conference in a Scandinavian country)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#fnp21">*</A>]</FONT> ] -- shows us what is right and what is wrong in the usual phrase about the collapse of the International. This phrase is reiterated with malicious relish by the bourgeois and the opportunists<A NAME="p21"> (<I>riformisti di destra** </I>), and with bitterness by socialists (<I>Volksrecht </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en9">9</A>]</FONT> in Zurich, and <I>Bremer B&uuml;rger-Zeitung </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en10">10</A>]</FONT>. There is a great deal of truth in the phrase! The downfall of the leaders and of most of the parties in the present-day International is a fact.<A NAME="p21a"> (Compare <I>Vorw&auml;rts</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en11">11</A>]</FONT> Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en12">12</A>]</FONT> and <I>Hamburger Echo </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en13">13</A>]</FONT> versus <I>l'Humanit&eacute;</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en14">14</A>]</FONT> and the appeals of the Belgian and the French socialists versus the "reply" of the German <I>Vorstand.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en15">15</A>]</FONT>) The <B>masses</B> have <I>not yet</I> spoken out! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   However, Zibordi is a thousand times right in saying that it is not a matter of "<I>dottrina &egrave; sbagliata </I>", or of the "<I>rimedio </I>" of socialism being "</I>errato </I>", but "<I>semplicemente non erano in dose bastante </I>", "<I>gli altri socialisti non sono 'abbastanza socialisti </I>'". *** 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is not socialism that has collapsed, in the shape of the <I>present-day European</I> International, but an insufficient socialism, i.e., <I>opportunism</I> and <I>reformism.</I> It is this "tendency" -- which exists <I>everywhere</I>, in all countries, and has found such vivid expression in Bissolati and Co. in Italy -- that has collapsed,<A NAME="p21b"> for it has for years been <I>teaching</I> forgetfulness of the class struggle, <I>etc.</I>, <I>etc. -- from the resolution.</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#en16">16</A>]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Zibordi is right when he sees the European socialists' main guilt in "<I>cercano nobilitare con postumi motivi la loro incapacit&agrave; a prevenire</I>, <I>la loro necessit&agrave; di partecipare al macello </I>", in the fact that they "<I>preferisce fingere di fare per amore ci&ograve; ch'&egrave;</I> [European socialism]* <I>costretto a fare per forza </I>", that the socialists "solidarizzarono <I>ciascuno con la propria nazione, col Governo</I> borghese <I>della propria rulzione . . . in una misura da formare una delusione per noi</I> [also in all socialists who are not opportunists] <I>e un compiacimento per tutti i non socialisti d'Italia </I>"** (and not of Italy alone, but of all countries; cf., for instance, with Russian liberalism). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Even given the total <I>incapacit&agrave;</I> and impotence of the European socialists, the behaviour of their leaders reveals treachery and baseness: the workers have been driven into the slaughter, while their leaders vote <I>in favour</I> and join <I>governments </I>! Even with their total impotence, they should have voted <I>against</I>, should <I>not have joined</I> their governments and uttered chauvinistic infamies; should <I>not</I> have shown solidarity with their "nation", and should <I>not</I> have defended their "own" bourgeoisie, they should have unmasked its vileness. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Everywhere</I> there is the bourgeoisie and the imperialists, everywhere the ignoble preparations for carnage; if Russian tsarism is particularly infamous and barbarous (and more reactionary than all the rest), then German imperialism too is monarchist: its aims are feudal and dynastic, and its gross bourgeoisie are less free than the French. The Russian Social-Democrats were right in saying that <I>to them</I> the defeat of tsarism was the lesser evil, for <I>their</I> immediate enemy was, first and foremost, <I>Great-Russian</I>

chauvinism, but that in each country the socialists (who are not opportunists) ought to see their main enemy in their "own" ("home-made") chauvinism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is it true, however, that the "<I>incapacit&agrave; </I>" is so very absolute? Is that so? <I>Fucilare </I>?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#fnp23">*</A>]</FONT> <I>Heldentod </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="EWIS14.html#fnp23">**</A>]</FONT> and a miserable death?

Illegal propaganda and civil war would be more <I>honest</I>, and obligatory for socialists (<I>this</I>  is what the Russian socialists are calling for). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For Instance, they take comfort in the illusion that the war will end and things will settle down. .. But no! For the collapse of the present-day (1889-1914) International not to turn into the collapse of socialism, for the <I>masses</I> not to turn away, and to prevent the domination of anarchism and syndicalism (just as shamefully [as] in France), the truth must be looked in the face. Whoever wins, Europe is threatened by the <I>growth</I> of chauvinism, by "<I>revenge-seeking </I>". etc. Militarism, whether German or Great Russian, fosters counter-chauvinism and the like.

   <I>Vorw&auml;rts</I> -- a daily, central organ of the German Social-Democrats,  published in Berlin from 1876 by Wilhelm Liebknecht and other editors. Through this newspaper Engels fought against all manifestations of opportunism. In the latter half of the 1890s, following Engels's death, the newspaper systematically published articles

During the First World War (1914-18) the paper pursued a social-chauvinist policy, and after the October Socialist Revolution it became a mouthpiece of anti-Soviet propaganda.

During the First World War the news paper became a mouthpiece of the extreme Right wing of the French Socialist Party, and pursued a social-chauvinist policy. Shortly after the split in the Socialist Party at the Tours Congress in December 1920, and the formation of the Communist Party, it became the organ of the Communist Party.

   The reference is to the appeal addressed to the German people by the French and Belgian delegations to the International Socialist Bureau, and published in <I>l'Humanit&eacute;</I> on September 6, 1914. It accused the German Government of pursuing predatory designs and the German troops of perpetrating atrocities in the occupied areas. <I>Vorw&auml;rts</I> of September 10, 1964 <FONT SIZE=-2>[undoubtedly, 1914 --DJR]</FONT> carried a protest by the German Social-Democratic Party's Executive against this appeal. This started off a press polemic between French and German social-chauvinists, each side seeking to justify its own government's participation in the war and put the blame on the other side.

   Ever since its foundation in 1892, a sharp ideological struggle was conducted in the Italian Socialist Party between the opportunist and revolutionary wings, which differed on the question of the Party's policy and tactics. Under pressure from the Lefts, the most outspoken reformists (Bonomi, Bissolati), who supported the war and advocated collaboration with the government and the bourgeoisie, were expelled from the Party at its congress in Reggio Emilia in 1912. After the outbreak of the war, and before Italy's entry into it, the Party took an anti-war stand under the slogan: "Against the war, for neutrality!" In December 1914, the Party expelled a group of renegades (Mussolini and others) who defended the imperialist 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 460</B></FONT><P>

policy of the bourgeoisie and favoured Italy's participation in the war. The Italian Socialists met in a joint conference with the Swiss Socialists at Lugano (1914) and took an active part in the international socialist conferences in Zimmerwald (1915) and Kienthal (1916). On the whole however, the Italian Socialist Party followed a Centrist policy. With Italy's entry into the war in May 1915, the Party renounced its anti-war stand and issued a slogan "neither participate in the war, nor sabotage it", which in practice meant support for the war.

   <I>Die Neue Zeit</I> (<I>New Times </I>) -- theoretical journal of the German Social-Democratic Party published in Stuttgart from 1883 to 1923. Until October 1917 it was edited by Karl Kautsky and afterwards by Heinrich Cunow. Several works by Marx and Engels were first published in it. Engels helped the journal with advice, frequently criticising it for its deviations from Marxism. In the latter half of the nineties, following Engels's death, it systematically published articles by revisionists, including a series of Bernstein's articles called "Problems of Socialism", which launched a revisionist crusade against Marxism. During the First World War <I>Die Neue Zeit</I> held a Centrist position, which in practice supported social-chauvinists.
