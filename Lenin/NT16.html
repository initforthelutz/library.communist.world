<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The old Economism<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en2">2</A>]</FONT> of 1894-1902 reasoned thus: the Narodniks<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en3">3</A>]</FONT> have been refuted; capitalism has triumphed in Russia. Consequently, there can be no question of political revolution. The practical conclusion: either "economic struggle be left to the workers and political struggle to the liberals" -- that is a curvet to the right -- or, instead of political revolution, a general strike for socialist revolution. That curvet to the left was advocated in a pamphlet, now forgotten, of a Russian Economist of the late nineties.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en4">4</A>]</FONT>  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Now a new Economism is being born. Its reasoning is similarly base on the two curvets: Right -- we are against the "right to self-determination" i.e., against the liberation of oppressed peoples, the struggle against annexations -- that has not yet been fully thought out or clearly stated). "Left" -- we are opposed to a minimum programme (i.e., opposed to struggle for reforms and democracy) as "contradictory" to sociaIist revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p13a">
   It is more than a year now since this nascent trend was revealed to several comrades at the Berne Conference in the spring of 1915. At that time, happily, only one comrade, who met with universal disapproval, insisted on these ideas of imperialist Economism right up to the end of the Conference and formulated them in writing in special "theses". <I>No one</I> associated himself with these theses.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en5">5</A>]</FONT>  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Subsequently two others associated themselves with this comrade's theses against self-determination (unaware that the question was inextricably linked with the general line of the afore-mentioned "theses").<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en6">6</A>]</FONT> But the appearance of the "Dutch programme" in February 1916, published in No. 3 of the <I>Bulletin of the International Socialist Committee</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en7">7</A>]</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 14</B></FONT><P>

<I>immediately</I> brought out this "misunderstanding" and <I>again</I> compelled the author of the original theses to <I>restate</I> his imperialist Economism, this time, too, as a whole, and not merely in application to one allegedly "partial" issue. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is absolutely necessary again and again to <I>warn</I> the comrades concerned that they have <I>landed themselves in a quagmire</I>, that their "ideas" have <I>nothing in common either with Marxism or revolutionary Social-Democracy</I>. We can no longer leave the matter "in the dark": that would only encourage ideological confusion and direct it into the <I>worst possible channel</I> of equivocation, "private" conflicts, incessant "friction", etc. Our duty, on the contrary, is to insist, in the most emphatic and categorioal manner, on the <I>obligation</I> thoroughly to think out and analyse questions raised for discussion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p14">
   In its theses on self-determination<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#fnp14">*</A>]</FONT> (which appeared in German as a reprint from No. 2 of <I>Vorbote</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en8">8</A>]</FONT>), the <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en9">9</A>]</FONT> editorial board purposely brought the matter into the press in an <I>impersonal</I>, but most detailed, form, emphasising in particular the <I>link</I> between self-determination and the <I>general</I> question of the struggle for reforms, for democracy, the impermissibility of ignoring the <I>political</I> aspect, etc. In his comments on the editorial board's theses, the author of the original theses (imperialist Economism) comes out in <I>solidarity with the Dutch programme</I>, thereby clearly demonstrating that self-determination is by no means a "partial" question, as exponcnts of the nascent trend maintain, but a general and basic one. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p14a">
   The Dutch programme was laid before representatives of the Zimmerwald Left<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en10">10</A>]</FONT> on February 5-8, 1916, at the Berne meeting of the International Socialist Committee.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en11">11</A>]</FONT> Not a single member of the Zimmerwald Left, <I>not even Radek</I>, spoke in favour of the programme, for it combines, indiscriminately, such points as "expropriation of the banks" and "repeal of customs tariffs", "abolition of the first Senate chamber", etc. The Zimmerwald Left unanimously, with practically no comment, in fact merely with a shrug of the shoulders, dismissed the Dutch programme as patently and wholly unsuitable.

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 15</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p15">
   However, the author of the original theses, written in the spring of 1915, was so fond of the programme that he declared: "Substantially, that is all I said, too [in the spring of 1915],<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#fnp15">*</A>]</FONT>  the Dutch have <I>thought things out</I> ": "<I>with them the economic aspect is expropriation of the banks and large-scale production</I> [enterprises], <I>the political aspect is a republic and so on. Absolutely correct!</I> " 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The fact, however, is that the Dutch did not "think things out", but produced an <I>unthought-out</I> programme. It is the sad fate of Russia that some among us grasp at precisely what is not thought out in the newest novelty. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The author of the 1915 theses believes that the <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> editors lapsed into a contradiction when they "themselves" urged "expropriation of the banks", and even added the word "immediately" (plus "dictatorial measures") in &#167;8 ("Concrete Measures"). "And how I was reproached for this very thing in Bernel" the author of the 1915 theses exclaims indignantly, recalling the Berne debates in the spring of 1915. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He forgets or fails to see this "minor" point: in &#167;8 the <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> editors clearly distinguish <I>two</I> eventualities: <B>I</B>. The socialist revolution has <I>begun</I>. In that event, they say: "immediate expropriation of the banks", etc. <B>II</B>. The socialist revolution has <I>not</I> begun, and in that event we shall have to postpone talking about these good things. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Since the socialist revolution, in the above-mentioned sense, has obviously not <I>yet</I> begun, the Dutch programme is incongruous. And the author of the theses adds his bit of "<I>profundity </I>" by reverting (he always seems to slip on the same spot!) to his old mistake of turning political demands (like "abolition of the first chamber"?) into a "<I>political formula for social revolution </I>". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Having marked time for a whole year, the author returned to his old mistake. That is the "crux" of his misadventures: he cannot solve the problem of <I>how to link the advent of imperialism with the struggle for reforms and democracy</I> -- just as the Economism of blessed memory could not link the advent of capitalism with the struggle for democracy.

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 16</B></FONT> <P>

&nbsp &nbsp
   Hence -- complete confusion concerning the "unachievability" of democratic demands under imperialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p16">
  Hence -- ignoring of the political struggle now, at present, immediately, and at all times, which is impermissible for a Marxist (and permissible only for a <I>Rabochaya Mysl</I> <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en12">12</A>]</FONT> Economist). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Hence -- the knack of persistently "sliding" from recognition of imperialism to apology for imperialism (just as the Economists of blessed memory slid from recognition of capitalism to apology for capitalism). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And so on, and so forth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A detailed examination of the errors the author of the 1915 theses commits in his comments on the <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> self-determination theses is impossible, for <I>every line is wrong!</I> After all, you cannot write pamphlets or books in reply to "comments" if the initiators of imperialist Economism spend a whole year marking time and stubbornly refuse to concern themselves with what ought to be their direct party duty if they want to take a serious attitude to political issues, namely: a considered and articulate statement of what they designate as "our differences". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I am therefore obliged to confine myself to a brief review of how the author applies his basic error and how he "supplements" it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p16a">
   He believes that I contradict myself: in 1914 (in <I>Prosueshcheniye</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en13">13</A>]</FONT>) I wrote that it was absurd to look for self determination "in the programmes of <I>West-European socialists</I> "<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#fnp16">*</A>]</FONT>, but in 1916 I proclaim self-determination to be especially urgent. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It did not occur (!!) to the author that these "programmes" were drawn up in 1875, 1880, 1891!<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en14">14</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Now let us take his objections (to the <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> self-determination theses) point by point. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   &#167;1. The same Economist refusal to see and pose <I>political</I> questions. <I>Since</I> socialism creates the economic basis for the abolition of national oppression in the political sphere, <I>therefore</I> our author refuses to formulate our <I>political tasks</I> in this sphere! That's ridiculous!

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 17</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Since</I> the victorious proletariat does not negate wars against the bourgeoisie of other countries, <I>therefore</I> the author refuses to formulate our political tasks in relation to national oppression!! These are all examples of downright violation of Marxism and logic, or, if you like, manifestations of the <I>logic</I> of the fundamental errors of imperialist Economism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   &#167;2. The opponents of self-determination are hopelessly confused in their references to its being "unachievable". 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> editors explain to them <I>two</I> possible interpretations of unachievability and their error in <I>both cases</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Yet the author of the 1915 theses, without even trying to give <I>his</I> interpretation of "unachievability", i.e., <I>accepting</I> our explanation that two different things are confused here, <I>persists in that confusion!!</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He ties crises to "imperialist" "policy": our expert on political economy <I>has forgotten</I> that there were crises <I>before</I> imperialism! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To maintain that self-determination is unachievable economically is to confuse the issue, the editors explain. The author does <I>not</I> reply, does <I>not</I> state that he considers self-determination unachievable <I>economically</I>; he abandons his dubious position and jumps over to politics (unachievable "all the same") though he has been told with the utmost clarity that <I>politically</I> a republic is just as "unachievable" under imperialism as self-determination. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Cornered, the author "jumps" again: he accepts a republic and the whole minimum programme only as a "political formula for social revolution"!!! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He refuses to defend the "economic" unachievability of self-determination and jumps to politics, maintaining that political unachievability applies to the minimum programme as a whole. Here, again there is not a grain of Marxism, not a grain of logic, save the <I>logic of imperialist Economism</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The author wants <I>imperceptibly</I> (without stopping to think, without producing anything articulate, without making any effort to work out his programme) to jettison the Social-Democratic Party minimum programme! No wonder he has been marking time for a whole year!! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The question of combating <I>Kautskyism</I> is again not a partial, but a <I>general</I> and <I>basic</I> question of modern times: 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 18</B></FONT><P>

the author does <I>not understand</I> this struggle. Just as the Economists turned the struggle against the Narodniks into an apology for capitalism, so the author turns the struggle against Kautskyism into an apology for imperialism (that applies also to &#167;3). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The mistake of the Kautskyites lies in the fact that they present in a reformist manner such demands, and at such a time, that can be presented only in a revolutionary manner (but the author lapses into the position that their mistake is to advance these demands altogether, just as the Economists "understood" the struggle against Narodism to mean that the slogan "Down with the autocracy" was Narodism). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The mistake of the Kautskism lies in projecting <I>correct</I> democratic demands into the past, to peaceful capitalism, and not into he furture, to the social revolution (the author, however, falls into the position of regarding these demands as incorrect). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    &#167;3. See above. The author bypasses <I>also</I> the question of "federation". The same old fundamental mistake of the same old Economism: inability to pose <I>political</I> questions.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#fnp18">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    &#167;4. "From self-determination follows defence of the fatherland," the author obstinately repeats. His mistake here is to make negation of defence of the fatherland a <I>shibboleth</I>, deduce it <I>not</I> from the concrete historical features of a <I>given</I> war, but apply it "in general". That is not Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The author has been told long ago -- try to think up a formula of struggle against national oppression or inequality which (formula) does <I>not</I> justify "defence of the fatherland". You cannot devise such a formula, and the author has not challenged that. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Does that mean that we reject the fight against national oppression if it <I>could</I> be interpreted to imply defence of the fatherland? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    No, for we are opposed not to "defence of the fatherland" "in general" (see our Party resolutions**), but to using this 

<A NAME="fnp18">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
* "We are not afraid of disintegration," the author writes, "we do not defend national houndaries." Now, just try to give that a precise political formulation!! <I>You simply cannot do it</I> and that's where the trouble lies; you are hampered by Economist blindness on questions of <I>political democracy</I>.  <BR>

fraudulent slogan to <I>embellish</I> the present <I>imperialist war</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The author <I>wants</I> to pose the question of "defence of the fatherland" in a <I>basically incorrect</I> and <I>unhistorical</I> way (but he cannot; he has been trying in vain for a whole year. . .).   His reference to "dualism" shows that he does not understand the difference between monism and dualism.   If I "unite" a shoe brush and a mammal, will that be "monism"?   If I say that to reach goal a we must 
<P><CENTER>
                            (c) --><I>a</I><-- (b)
</CENTER><BR>
travel to the left from point (b) and to the right from point (c), will that be "dualism"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Is the position of the proletariat with regard to national oppression the same in oppressing and oppressed nations? No, it is not the same, not the same <I>economically</I>, <I>politically</I>, <I>ideologically</I>, <I>spiritually</I>, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Meaning? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Meaning that some will approach in <I>one</I> way, others in <I>another</I> way <I>the same</I> goal (the merger of nations) from <I>different</I> starting-points. Denial of that is the "monism" that unites a shoe brush and a mammal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It is <I>not</I> proper to say this [i.e., to <I>urge</I> self-determination] to the proletarians of an oppressed nation" -- that is how the author "interprets" the editors' theses. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That's amusing!! There is <I>nothing of the kind</I> in the theses. The author has either not read them to the end or has not given them any thought at all. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
   &#167;5. See above on Kautskyism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   &#167;6. The author is told there are <I>three</I> types of countries in the world. He "objects" and snatches out "cases". That is casuistry, not politics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You want a concrete "case": "How about Belgium"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp <A NAME="p19">
   See the Lenin and Zinoviev pamphlet<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="NT16.html#en15">15</A>]</FONT>: it says that we would be <I>for</I> the defence of Belgium (even <I>by war</I>) if this concrete war were different.*

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You do not agree with that? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Then say so!! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You have <I>not properly thought out</I> the question of <I>why</I> Social-Democrats are against "defence of the fatherland". 

<BR> &nbsp &nbsp
  We are not against it for the reasons you believe, because your presentation of the question (vain efforts, not really a presentation) goes against history. That is my reply to the author. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To describe as "sophistry" the fact that while <I>justifying wars for the elimination of national oppression</I>, we do not justify the present imperialist war, which on <I>both</I> sides is being waged to <I>increase</I> national oppression -- is to use "strong" words without giving the matter <I>the least bit of thought</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The author <I>wants</I> to pose the question of "defence of the fatherland" from a more "Left" position, but the result (for a whole year now) is utter confusion! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   &#167;7. The author <I>criticises</I>: "The question of 'peace terms' is not touched upon at all." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Strange criticism: failure to deal with a question we did not even raise!! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But what is "touched upon" and discussed is the question of <I>annexations</I>, on which the imperialist Economists are utterly confused, this time <I>together</I> with the Dutch and Radek. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Either you reject the immediate slogan <I>against old and new annexations</I> -- (no less "unachievable" under imperialism than self-determination, in Europe as well as in the colonies) -- and in that case you pass from concealed to open apology for imperialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Or you accept the slogan (as Radek has done in the press) -- and in that case you accept self-determination of nations under a different name!! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   &#167;8. The author proclaims "Bolshevism on a West-European scale" ("not your position," he adds). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I attach no importance to this desire to cling to the word "Bolshevism", for I know <I>such</I> "old Bolsheviks" from whom God save us. I can only say that the author's proclamation of "Bolshevism on a West-European scale" is, I am deeply convinced, neither Bolshevism nor Marxism, but a minor variant of the same old Economism. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 21</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In my view it is highly intolerable, flippant and non-Party to proclaim for a whole year the <I>new Bolshevism</I> and leave things at that. Is it not time to <I>think</I> matters out and give the comrades an articulate and integrated <I>expos&eacute</I> of "Bolshevism on a West-European scale"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The author has not proved and will not prove the difference between colonies and oppressed nations in Europe (as applied to the question under discussion).

Pyatakov</A>)" and "<A HREF="CM16.html">A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist Economism</A>". -- <FONT SIZE=-2><I>DJR</I></FONT>] were directed against the un-Marxist and anti-Bolshevik attitude of the Bukharin-Pyatakov-Bosh group which began to take shape in the spring of 1915, when preparations were being made for publication of the magazine <I>Kommunist</I>. It was to be put out in co-operation with <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I>. Y. L. Pyatakov (P. Kievsky) and Y. B. Bosh undertook to finance the magazine and N. I. Bukharin was made one of its editors. Lenin's differences with the group were accentuated after the appearance of No. 1-2 of <I>Kommunist</I> in September 1915. In their theses "On the Self-Determination Slogan", which they sent to <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I>, Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosh opposed Lenin's theory of socialist revolution, rejected the struggle for democracy in the imperialist era and insisted on the Party withdrawing its demand for national self-determination. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The group did not confine itself to theoretical differences and openly attacked the Party's policy and slogans. It sought to use <I>Kommunist</I> in furtherance of its factional aims and tried to dictate terms to the editors of <I>Sotsial-Dernokrat</I>. Pyatakov and Bosh insisted on the Central Committee Bureau Abroad recognising them as a separate group not accountable to it and authorised to maintain independent connections with Central Committee members in Russia and publish leaflets and other literature. Thougth this demand was turned down, the group attempted to establish contact with the Central Committee Bureau in Russia. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   Lenin was sharply opposed to the Pyatakov-Bosh-Bukharin theses, saying that "we can take no responsibility for them, either direct or indirect -- even for harbouring them in the Party, Iet alone granting them equality". In letters to N. I. Bukharin, Y. L. Pyatakov, G. Y. Zinoviev and A. G. Shlyapnikov, Lenin trenchantly criticised the group's views and anti-Party, factional actions and condemned the conciliatory attitude of Zinoviev and Shlyapnikov. On his proposal, joint publication of <I>Kornmunist</I> by the <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> editors and the group was discontinued. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "Nascent Trend of Imperialist Economism" was written when the <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> editors had received Bukharin's comments on the theses "<A HREF="SRSD16.html">The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination</A> (<I>Theses </I>)". The article was not published at the time.

   <I>Economism</I> was an opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at the turn of the century, a Russian variety of international 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 378</B></FONT><P>

opportunism. The Economists limited the tasks of the working-class movement to the economic struggle for higher wages, better working conditions, etc., maintaining that the political slruggle shouId be left to the liberal bourgeoisie. They denied the leading role of the working-class party. Making a fetish of the spontaneity of the working-class movement, they belittled the importance of revolutionary theory and, by denying the need for a Marxist party to bring socialist consciousness into the working-class movement, cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. They championed the existing disunity, confusion and parochial amateurish approach in the Social-Democratic ranks, and opposed the creation of a centralised working-class party. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   Comprehensive criticism by Lenin of the Economist standpoint will be found in his "A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats", "A Retrograde Trend in Russian Social-Democracy", "Apropos of the <I>Profession de Foi</I>" and "A Talk with Defenders of Economism" (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 167-82, 255-85, 286-96, and Vol. 5 pp. 313-20). Lenin's <A HREF="WD02.html"><I>What Is To Be Done?</A></I> brought about the ideological rout of Economism (see present edition, Vol. 5, pp.347-529). A major part in the struggle against the Economists was also played by the newspaper <I>Iskra</I>.

   <I>Narodniks</I> -- followers of a petty-bourgeois trend, Narodism, in the Russian revolutionary movement, which arose in the sixties and seventies of the nineteenth century. The Narodniks stood for the abolilion of the autocracy and the transfer of the landed estates to the peasantry. At the same time, they believed capitalism in Russia to be a temporary phenomenon with no prospect of development and they therefore considered the peasantry, not the proletariat, to be the main revolutionary force in Russia. They regarded the village commune as the embryo of socialism. With the object of rousing the peasantry to struggle against the autocracy, the Narodniks "went among the people", to the villages, but found no support there. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks adopted a policy of conciliation to tsarism, expressed the interests of the kulak class and waged a bitter fight against Marxism.

   Reference is to the article "Who Will Perform the Political Revolution?" in the symposium <I>Proletarian Struggle</I> No. 1, published by the Urals Social-Democratic Group in 1899. The artirle was republished as a pamphlet by the Kiev Committee. The author, A. A. Sanin, an Economist, was opposed to an independent working-class political party and political revolution, believing that Russia's socialist transformation, which he considered an immediate task, could be accomplished through a general strike.

   Reference is to the <I>Conference of</I> <I>R</I>.<I>S</I>.<I>D</I>.<I>L</I>.<I>P</I>. groups abroad, held in Berne between February 14 and 19 (February 27-March 4), 1915. Convened on Lenin's initiative, it assumed the character of a 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 379</B></FONT><P>

general Party conference, since neither a Party congress nor an all-Russia conference could be convened during the war. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Conference was attended by representatives of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, the R.S.D.L.P. Central Organ, <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I>, the Social-Democrat Women's Organisation and delegates from R.S.D.L.P. groups in Paris, Zurich, Berne, Lausanne, Geneva, London and Baugy. All members of the Berne group and several members of the Lausanne and Baugy groups attended as guests. Lenin was delegated by the Central Committee and Central Organ and directed the work of the Conference. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The main item on the agenda, the war and the tasks of the Party, was introduced by Lenin, who amplified the propositions set out in the CentraI Committee Manifesto, "The War and Russian Social-Democracy". The resolutions tabled by the Montpellier, and especially the Baugy, groups and adopted by tbe Conference revealed that some Party members had failed to grasp the implications of Lenin's proposition on civil war. They objected to the slogan of the defeat of one's "own" government and advanced their own slogan of peace, and failed to appreciate the need and importance of combating Centrism. All these questions were thrashed out in the debate, and Lenin's theses were unanimously approved. Only Bukharin persistently supported the erroneous views of the Baugy resolution and objected to the slogans Lenin had formulated for the Party and the international Social-Democratic movement. Bukharin opposed the right of nations to self-determination and the minimum-programme demands in general, contending that they were "contrary" to socialist revolution. However, no one supported Bukharin at the conference.

   This refers to the ''Programm-Entwurf der R.S.V. und der S.D.A.P. Hollands" ("Draft Programme of the Revolutionary-Socialist League and the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Holland") compiled by Henriette Roland-Holst and published on February 29, 1916 in No. 3 of the <I>Bulletin of the International Socialist Committee</I> over the signatures of Henriette Roland-Holst, J .

   <I>The International Socialist Committee</I> -- the executive body of    the Zimmerwald group elected at the first Internalional Socialist Conference in Zimmerwald, September 5-8, 1915, and composed of Robert Grimm, Oddino Morgari, Charles Naine and A. Balabanova. Its headquarters were in Berne. Shortly after the Zimmerwald Conference, on Grimm's suggestion, a larger International Socialist Committee was formed, composed of representatives of all the parties subscribing to the Zimmerwald decisions. The R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee was represented on it by Lenin, Inessa Armand and Zinoviev. It published the <I>Internationale Sozialistische</I>

   <I>Vorbote</I> (<I>The Herald </I>) -- theoretical organ of the Zimmerwald Left published in German in Berne. Two issues appeared, in January and April 1916. The official publishers were Roland-Holst and Pannekoek. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   Lenin had an active share in founding the magazine and, after the appearance of its first issue, in organising a French edition to reach a wider readership. A keen discussion was conducted on its pages by Left Zimmerwaldists on the right of nations to self-determination and the "disarmament" slogan.

   <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> -- illegal Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. published from February 1908 to January 1917. After unsuccessful attempts to issue the first number of the paper in Russia, publication was arranged abroad. Nos. 2-32 (February 1909-December 1913) were put out in Paris and Nos. 33-58 (November 1914-January 1917) in Geneva. Altogether, 58 issues appeared, five of which had supplements. From December 1911, <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> was edited by Lenin and carried more than 80 of his articles and shorter items. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   Lenin directed all the affairs of the paper, decided on the contents of the current issue, edited the various contributions and Iooked after the production side. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   During the First World War, <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> played an outstanding part in combating international opportunism, nationalism and chauvinism, in popularising the Bolshevik slogans and in awakening the working class and the working people generally for struggle against the imperialist war and its instigators, against the tsarist autocracy and capitalism. <I>Sotsial-Demokrat</I> also played a major part in uniting the internationalist forces in the Social-Democratic movement.

   <I>The Zimmerwald Left</I> was formed on Lenin's initiative at the International Socialist Conference in Zimmerwald in September 1915. The group consisted of eight of the Conference delegates, representing the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, Left Social-Democrats in Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Germany the Polish Social-Democratic opposition and the Latvian Social-Democrats. Led by Lenin, it combated the Centrist conference majority. Its draft resolutions and draft Manifesto condemning the war, exposing the treachery of the social-chauvinists and emphasising the need for active struggle against the war were rejected by the Centrist majority. However, the Zimmerwald Left did succeed in including in the adopted Manifesto a number of important points from its draft resolution. Regarding the Manifesto as a first step in the struggle against the imperialist war, the Zimmerwald Left voted for it, but in a special statement pointed out its inadequacy and inconsistency. At the same time, the group stated that while it would remain part 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 381</B></FONT><P>

of the Zimmerwald movement, it would continue to disseminate its views and conduct independent work internationally. It elected a Bureau, which included Lenin, Zinoviev and Radek, and published its own organ, <I>Vorbote</I> (see Note <A HREF="NT16.html#en8">No. 8</A>). 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Bolsheviks, the only ones to take a correct and consistently internationalist position, were the leading force in the Zimmerwald Left. Lenin combated Radek's opportunist vacillations and criticised the mistakes of other members of the group. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Zimmerwald Left became the rallying point for internationalist elements in the world Social-Democratic movement (see also Note No. 36).

   This meeting, held in Berne, February 5-9, 1916, was attended by 22 representatives of internationalist socialists in Germany, Russia, Italy, Norway, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Rumania and several more countries. The composition of the meeting was indicative of the changed alignment of forces in favour of the Left, though most of the delegates, as at the original Zimmerwald Conference, were Centrists. 

<BR>&nbsp &nbsp
   The meeting adopted an appeal to all affiliated parties and groups (<I>Rundschreiben an alle angeschlossen Parteien und Gruppen</I>), in which were included, as a result of pressure from the Bolsheviks and other Left forces, amendments in line with the Zimmerwald Left policy. The appeal condemned socialist participation in bourgeois governments, denounced the slogan of "fatherland defence" in an imperialist war and approval of war credits. It stressed the need to support the labour movement and prepare for mass revolutionary actions against the imperialist war. However, the appeal was inconsistent, since it did not call for a break with social-chauvinism and opportunism. Not all of Lenin's amendments were adopted. The Zimmerwald Lefts declared that though they did not consider the appeal satisfactory in all its points, they would vote for it as a step forward compared with the decisions of the first Zimmerwald Conference.

   Reference is to the Declaration of the Polish Social-Democrats at the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference. The Declaration protested against the oppressive policy of the tsarist and German and Austrian governments which "deprive the Polish people of the opportunity to shape their own destiny, regard the Polish lands as a pawn in future bargaining over compensation. . . ." "And this," the Declaration said, "brings out with especial crudity the very essence of the policy of the capitalist governments which, in sending the masses to the slaughter, are at the same time arbitrarily shaping the destinies of nations for generations to come." The Polish Social-Democrats, the Declaration said, are convinced that only participation in the impending struggle of the international revolutionary proletariat for socialism -- "in the struggle that will tear the fetters of national oppression and destroy alien domination in whatever form or shape -- will assure the Polish people, too, the opportunity for all-round development as an equal member of the alliance of the nations".
