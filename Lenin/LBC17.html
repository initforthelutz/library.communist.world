    Comrades,

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Our revolution is passing through a highly critical period. This crisis coincides with the great crisis -- the growth of the world socialist revolution and the struggle waged against it by world imperialism. A gigantic task is being presented to the responsible leaders of our Party, and failure to perform it will involve the danger of a complete collapse of the internationalist proletarian movement. The situation is such that, in truth, delay would be fatal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take a glance at the international situation. The growth of a world revolution is beyond dispute. The outburst of indignation on the part of the Czech workers has been suppressed<A NAME="p182"> with incredible ferocity, testifying to the government's extreme fright. Italy too has witnessed a mass outbreak in Turin.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LBC17.html#en76">76</A>]</FONT> Most important, however, is the revolt in the German navy. One can imagine the enormous difficulties of a revolution in a country like Germany, especially under present conditions. It cannot be doubted that the revolt in the German navy is indicative of the great crisis -- the growth of the world revolution. While our chauvinists, who are advocating Germany's defeat, demand a revolt of the German workers immediately, we Russian revolutionary internationalists know from the experience of 1905-17 that a more impressive sign of the growth of revolution than a revolt among the troops cannot be imagined. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Just think what our position is now in the eyes of the German revolutionaries. They can say to us: We have only Liebknecht who openly called for a revolution. His voice has been stifled in a convict prison. We have not a single newspaper which openly explains the necessity for a revolu- 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 183</B></FONT><P>

tion; we have not got freedom of assembly. We have not a single Soviet of Workers' or Soldiers' Deputies. Our voice barely reaches the real, broad mass of people. Yet we made an attempt at revolt, although our chance was only one in a hundred. But you Russian revolutionary internationalists have behind you a half-year of free agitation, you have a score of newspapers, you have a number of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, you have gained the upper hand in the Soviets of Petrograd and Moscow, you have on your side the entire Baltic fleet and all the Russian troops in Finland. And still you do not respond to our call for an uprising, you do not overthrow your imperialist, Kerensky, although the chances are a hundred to one that your uprising will be successful. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Yes, we shall be real traitors to the International if, at such a moment and under such favourable conditions, we respond to this call from the German revolutionaries with . . . <I>mere</I> resolutions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Add to this, as we all perfectly well know, that the plotting and conspiracy of the international imperialists against the Russian revolution are rapidly growing. International imperialism is coming closer to the idea of stifling the revolution at all costs, stifling it both by military measures and by a peace made at the expense of Russia. It is this that is making the crisis in the world socialist revolution so acute, and is rendering our delay of the uprising particularly dangerous -- I would almost say criminal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Take, further, Russia's internal situation. The petty-bourgeois compromising parties which expressed the na&iuml;ve confidence of the masses in Kerensky and in the imperialists in general, are absolutely bankrupt. Their collapse is complete. The vote cast against coalition by the Soviet curia at the Democratic Conference, the vote cast against coalition by a <I>majority</I> of the local Soviets of Peasants' Deputies (in spite of their central Soviet, where Avksentyev and other friends of Kerensky's are installed), the elections in Moscow, where the working-class population has the closest ties with the peasants, and where <I>over 49 per cent</I> voted for the Bolsheviks (and among the soldiers fourteen thousand out of seventeen thousand) -- does this not signify that the confidence of the people in Kerensky and in those 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 184</B></FONT><P>

who are compromising with Kerensky and Co. has completely collapsed? Can one imagine any way in which the people could say more clearly to the Bolsheviks than they did by this vote, "Lead us, we shall follow you"? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And we, who have thus won the majority of the people over to our side, and who have gained the Soviets in both the capital cities -- are we to wait? What for? For Kerensky and his Kornilovite generals to surrender Petrograd to the Germans, and thus enter directly or indirectly, openly or secretly, into a conspiracy with <I>both</I> Buchanan <I>and</I> Wilhelm for the purpose of completely stifling the Russian revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   By the Moscow vote and by the re-elections to the Soviets, the people have expressed their confidence in us, but that is not all. There are signs of growing apathy and indifference. That is understandable. It implies not the ebb of the revolution, as the Cadets and their henchmen vociferate, but the ebb of confidence in resolutions and elections. In a revolution, the masses demand action, not words from the leading parties, they demand victories in the struggle, not talk. The moment is approaching when the people may conceive the idea that the Bolsheviks are no better than the others, since they were unable <I>to act</I> when the people placed confidence in them. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The peasant revolt is spreading over the whole country. It is perfectly clear that the Cadets and their hangers-on are minimising it in every way and are claiming it to be nothing but "riots" and "anarchy". That lie is being refuted because in the revolt centres the land is beginning to be handed over to the peasants. "Riots" and "anarchy" have never led to such splendid political results! The tremendous strength of the peasant revolt is shown by the fact that the compromisers and the Socialist-Revolutionaries of <I>Dyelo Naroda</I>, and <I>even</I> Breshko-Breshkovskaya, have begun to talk of transferring the land to the peasants in order to check the movement before it has finally engulfed them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Are we to wait until the Cossack units of the Kornilovite Kerensky (who was recently exposed as a Kornilovite by the Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves) succeed in suppressing this peasant revolt <I>piecemeal </I>? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Apparently, many leaders of our Party have failed to note the <I>specific</I> meaning of the slogan which we all adopted and

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 185</B></FONT><P>

which we have repeated endlessly. The slogan is "All Power to the Soviets". There were periods, there were moments during the six months of the revolution, when this slogan did not mean insurrection. Perhaps those periods and those moments blinded some of our comrades and led them to forget that now, at least since the middle of September, this slogan for us too has become <I>equivalent to a call for insurrection.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There can be no shadow of doubt on this score. <I>Dyelo Naroda</I> recently explained this "in a popular way", when it said "Kerensky will under no circumstances submit!" As if he could! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The slogan "All Power to the Soviets" is nothing but a call for insurrection. And the blame will be wholly and undoubtedly ours, if we, who for months have been calling upon the people to revolt and repudiate compromise, fail to lead them to revolt on the eve of the revolution's collapse, after the people have expressed their confidence in us. 
<A NAME="p185">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Cadets and compromisers are trying to scare us by citing the example of July 3-5, by pointing to the intensified agitation of the Black Hundreds,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LBC17.html#en77">77</A>]</FONT> and so forth. But if any mistake was made on July 3-5, it was that we did not take power. I do not think we made a mistake then, for at that time we were not <I>yet</I> in a majority. But now it would be a fatal mistake, worse than a mistake. The spread of Black Hundred agitation is understandable. It is an aggravation of extremes in an atmosphere of a developing proletarian and peasant revolution. But to use this as an argument <I>against</I> an uprising is ridiculous, for the impotence of the Black Hundreds, hirelings of the capitalists, <I>the impotence of the Black Hundreds in the struggle</I>, does not even require proof. In the struggle they are not worth considering. In the struggle Kornilov and Kerensky can only rely on the Savage Division and the Cossacks. And now demoralisation has set in even among the Cossacks; furthermore, the peasants are threatening them with civil war within their Cossack regions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   I am writing these lines on Sunday, October 8. You will read them not earlier than October 10. I have heard from a comrade who passed through here that people travelling on the Warsaw railway say, "Kerensky is bringing Cossacks to Petrograd!" This is quite probable, and it will be entirely 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 186</B></FONT><P>

our fault if we do not verify it <I>most carefully</I> and do not <I>make a study</I> of the strength and distribution of <I>the Kornilovite troops of the second draft.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Kerensky has again brought Kornilovite troops into the vicinity of Petrograd in order to prevent state power from passing into the hands of the Soviets, in order to prevent this power from proposing an immediate peace, in order to prevent all the land from being immediately handed over to the peasants, in order to surrender Petrograd to the Germans, and himself escape to Moscow! That is the slogan of the insurrection which we must circulate as widely as possible and which will have a tremendous success. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We must not wait for the All-Russia Congress of Soviets, which the Central Executive Committee may delay even until November. We must not delay and permit Kerensky to bring up more Kornilovite troops. Finland, the fleet and Revel are represented at the Congress of Soviets. These can together start an immediate movement on Petrograd against the Kornilovite regiments, a movement of the fleet, artillery, machine-guns and two or three army corps, such as have shown, for instance in Vyborg, the intensity of their hatred for the Kornilovite generals, with whom Kerensky is again in collusion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It would be a great mistake to refuse to seize the opportunity of immediately smashing the Kornilovite regiments of the second draft on the ground that the Baltic fleet, by moving into Petrograd, would allegedly expose the front to the Germans. The Kornilovite slanderers will say this, as they will tell any lie, but it is unworthy of revolutionaries to allow themselves to be intimidated by lies and slanders. Kerensky will surrender Petrograd to the Germans, that is now as clear as daylight. No assertions to the contrary can destroy our full conviction that this is so, for it follows from the entire course of events and Kerensky's entire policy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Kerensky and the Kornilovites will surrender Petrograd to the Germans. And it is in order to save Petrograd that Kerensky must be overthrown and power taken by the <I>Soviets of both capital cities.</I> These Soviets will immediately propose a peace to all the nations and will thereby fulfil their duty to the German revolutionaries. They will thereby also be taking a decisive step towards frustrating the criminal' 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 187</B></FONT><P>

conspiracies against the Russian revolution, the conspiracies of international imperialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Only the immediate movement of troops from Finland, and of the Baltic fleet, Revel and Kronstadt against the Kornilovite forces quartered near Petrograd can save the Russian and the world revolution. Such a movement has a hundred to one chance of leading <I>within a few days</I> to the surrender of a part of the Cossack troops, to the utter defeat of the other part, and to the overthrow of Kerensky, for the workers and the soldiers of both capital cities will support such a movement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In truth, delay would be fatal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The slogan "All Power to the Soviets" is a slogan of insurrection. Whoever uses this slogan without having grasped this and given thought to it will have only himself to blame. And insurrection must be treated as an <I>art.</I> I insisted on this during the Democratic Conference and I insist on it now, <I>because</I> that is what Marxism teaches us, and it is what is being taught us by the present situation in Russia and in the world generally. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is not a question of voting, of attracting the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, of additional provincial Soviets, or of a congress of these Soviets. It is a question of insurrection, which <I>can</I> and must be decided by Petrograd, Moscow, Helsingfors, Kronstadt, Vyborg and Revel. It is <I>in the vicinity of Petrograd</I> and in Petrograd itself that the insurrection can, and must be decided on and effected, as earnestly as possible, with as much preparation as possible, as quickly as possible and as energetically as possible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The fleet, Kronstadt, Vyborg, and Revel can and must advance on Petrograd; they can and must smash the Kornilovite regiments, rouse both the capital cities, start a mass agitation for a government which will immediately give land to the peasants and immediately make proposals for peace, overthrow Kerensky's government and establish such a government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Delay would be fatal.

   The reference is to the large anti-war manifestations in Turin, Italy, in August 1917. A demonstration against the food shortage broke out on August 21. The workers struck the following day, and a general strike followed. Barricades were thrown up. The movement assumed a political, anti-war character. On August 23 Turin's suburbs were in the hands of the insurgents. The Government threw the army against them and imposed martial law. The general strike was called off on August 27.
