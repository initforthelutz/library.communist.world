                                          QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE<P><BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   A slight increase in the election campaign activity, and the official-Cadet <I>Rech</I> has begun to speak (it has done so at last!) of the differences it has with the Lefts over questions of principle. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "We never intended, nor do we intend, to make peace with the June Third regime," writes <I>Rech.</I> 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  That is not true. You did intend and you do intend to, Cadet gentlemen. Evidence of it is your talk about a "responsible" opposition and an opposition in the possessive case. That is not merely "intending" peace, but a policy of "peace" with the June Third regime. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And what about Karaulov's pious speeches in the pious Third Duma? Or the Cadets' voting for the budget and for its more important items? Or the speeches of Berezovsky the First on the agrarian question? Or Gredeskul's recent statements, repeated in <I>Rech </I>? Does not all that amount to a policy of <I>peace</I> with the <I>foundations</I> of the June Third regime? It certainly does. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Over a period of five years," writes <I>Rech</I>, "we have never seen any difference between the tactics of the Social-Democratic Party <I>within the framework of the Duma</I> and those of other opposition parties. Yet in this case it is a question of elections to the Duma." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   There you have a specimen of sophistry and distortion of the truth! Not on a single question have Social-Democratic tactics in the Duma been akin to Cadet tactics. They have been fundamentally different on all questions: they have <I>not</I> been tactics of "peace" <I>or</I> of liberalism; they have <I>always</I> been tactics of <I>democracy</I> and the <I>class struggle.</I> 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 247</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Does <I>Rech</I> really maintain that mere "voting against" can be described as <I>kinship</I> in tactics, instead of kinship in posing questions from the standpoint of <I>principle</I> in the Duma speeches and in the formulas of procedure? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Does <I>Rech</I> really venture to say that it is permissible to say one thing in the Duma and another outside it? But if it does, is it not because it wants to hush up the issue of the <I>un</I>democratic character of Cadet propaganda <I>outside the Duma </I>? 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "We cannot deny the 'democratic' movement, which we serve ourselves, the right to independent aims and actions," writes <I>Rech.</I> 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   That is not true, educated liberal gentlemen! See if you can state your fundamental views on the distinction between liberalism and democracy. See if you can illustrate your views with examples from English, French or German history, even leaving out specifically working-class, proletarian, Marxist democracy. You will not be able to deny the distinction between bourgeois liberalism and bourgeois democracy as regards their attitude to the old order. And we shall always prove to you that you are a party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie and not at all a democratic party. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Bourgeois democracy in Russia is represented by the Trudoviks and Narodniks of all types. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   "Once you have set your hand to the plough you can't give up." You have set out to discuss the principles of the Cadets and the Lefts, so you must really explain those principles. That is the only way to raise election agitation somewhat above the question of how many lawless acts such-and-such a police officer, governor, or administrative body is guilty of.
