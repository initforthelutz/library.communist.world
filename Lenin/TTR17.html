                                     THE TASKS OF THE REVOLUTION<P><BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Russia is a country of the petty bourgeoisie, by far the greater part of the population belonging to this class. Its vacillations between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are inevitable, and only when it joins the proletariat is the victory of the revolution, of the cause of peace, freedom, and land for the working people assured easily, peacefully, quickly, and smoothly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The course of our revolution shows us these vacillations in practice. Let us then not harbour any illusions about the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties; let us stick firmly to the path of our proletarian class. The poverty of the poor peasants, the horrors of the war, the horrors of hunger -- all these are showing the masses more and more clearly the correctness of the proletarian path, the need to support the proletarian revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "peaceful" hopes of the petty bourgeoisie that there might be a "coalition" with the bourgeoisie and agreements with them, that it will be possible to wait "calmly" for the "speedy" convocation of the Constituent Assembly, etc., have been mercilessly, cruelly, implacably destroyed by the course of the revolution. The Kornilov revolt was the last cruel lesson, a lesson on a grand scale, supplementing thousands upon thousands of small lessons in which workers and peasants were deceived by local capitalists and landowners, in which soldiers were deceived by the officers etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Discontent, indignation and wrath are growing in the army, among the peasantry and among the workers. The "coalition" of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks with the bourgeoisie, promising everything and fulfilling 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 60</B></FONT><P>

nothing, is irritating the masses, is opening their eyes, is pushing them towards insurrection. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is a growing Left opposition among the Socialist-Revolutionaries (Spiridonova and others) and among the Mensheviks (Martov and others), and has already reached forty per cent of the Council and Congress of those parties. And down <I>below</I>, among the proletariat and the peasantry, particularly the poorest sections, the <I>majority</I> of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks belong to the <I>Lefts.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Kornilov revolt is instructive and has proved a good lesson. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is impossible to know whether the Soviets will be able to go farther than the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, and thus ensure a peaceful development of the revolution, or whether they will continue to mark time, thus making a proletarian uprising inevitable. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We cannot know this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our business is to help get everything possible done to make sure the "last" chance for a peaceful development of the revolution, to help by the presentation of our programme, by making clear its national character, its absolute accord with the interests and demands of a vast majority of the population. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The following lines are an essay in the presentation of such a programme. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let us take it more to those down below, to the masses, to the office employees, to the workers, to the peasants, not only to our supporters, but particularly to those who follow the Socialist-Revolutionaries, to the non-party elements, to the ignorant. Let us lift them up so that they can pass an independent judgement, make their own decisions, send <I>their own</I> delegations to the Conference, to the Soviets, to the government and our work will not have been in vain, <I>no matter what</I> the outcome of the Conference. This will then prove useful for the Conference, for the elections to the Constituent Assembly, and for all other political activity in general. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Experience teaches us that the Bolshevik programme and tactics are correct. So little time passed, so much happened from April 20 to the Kornilov revolt. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 61</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The experience of the <I>masses</I>, the experience of <I>oppressed</I> classes taught them very, very much in that time; the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks have completely cut adrift from the masses. This will most certainly be revealed in the discussion of our concrete programme insofar as we are able to bring it to the notice of the masses.

                                AGREEMENTS WITH THE CAPITALISTS<BR>
                                               ARE DISASTROUS<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  1.&nbsp;To leave in power the representatives of the bourgeoisie, even a small number of them, to leave in power such notorious Kornilovites as Generals Alexeyev, Klembovsky, Bagration, Gagarin, and others, or such as have proved their complete powerlessness in face of the bourgeoisie, and their ability of acting Bonaparte-fashion like Kerensky, is, on the one hand, merely opening the door wide to famine and the inevitable economic catastrophe which the capitalists are purposely accelerating and intensifying; on the other hand, it will lead to a military catastrophe, since the army hates the General Staff and cannot enthusiastically participate in the imperialist war. Besides, there is no doubt that Kornilovite generals and officers remaining in power will <I>deliberately open the front to the Germans</I>, as they have done in Galicia and Riga. This can be prevented only by the formation of a new government on a new basis, as expounded below. To continue any kind of agreements with the bourgeoisie after all that we have gone through since April 20 would be, on the part of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, not only an error but a direct betrayal of the people and of the revolution.

                                          POWER TO THE SOVIETS<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  2.&nbsp;All power in the country must pass exclusively to the representatives of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies on the basis of a definite programme and under the condition of the government being fully responsible to the Soviets. New elections to the Soviets must 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 62</B></FONT><P>

be held immediately, both to record the experience of the people during the recent weeks of the revolution, which have been particularly eventful, and to eliminate crying injustices (lack of proportional representation, unequal elections, etc.) which in some cases still remain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All power locally, wherever there are not yet any democratically elected institutions, and also in the army, must be taken over exclusively by the local Soviets and by commissars and other institutions elected by them, but only those that have been properly elected.  
  Workers and revolutionary troops, i.e., those who have in practice shown their ability to suppress the Kornilovites, must everywhere be armed, and this must be done with the full support of the state. 

<P><BR>

                                           PEACE TO THE PEOPLES<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  3.&nbsp;The Soviet Government must <I>straight away</I> offer to <I>all</I> the belligerent peoples (i.e., simultaneously both to their governments and to the worker and peasant masses) to conclude an immediate general peace on democratic terms, and also to conclude an immediate armistice (even if only for three months).  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The main condition for a democratic peace is the renunciation of annexations (seizures) -- not in the incorrect sense that all powers get back what they have lost, but in the only correct sense that <I>every</I> nationality without any exception, both in Europe and in the colonies, shall obtain its freedom and the possibility to decide for itself whether it is to form a <I>separate</I> state or whether it is to enter into the composition of some other state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In offering the peace terms, the Soviet Government must itself immediately take steps towards their fulfilment, i.e., it must publish and repudiate the secret treaties by which we have been bound up to the present time, those which were concluded by the tsar and which give Russian capitalists the promise of the pillaging of Turkey, Austria, etc. Then we must immediately satisfy the demands of the Ukrainians and the Finns, ensure them, as well as all other non-Russian nationalities in Russia, full freedom, including freedom of secession, applying the same <I>to all</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 63</B></FONT><P>

Armenia, undertaking to evacuate that country as well as the Turkish lands occupied by us, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such peace terms will not meet with the approval of the capitalists, but they will meet with such tremendous sympathy on the part of all the peoples and will cause such a great world-wide outburst of enthusiasm and of general indignation against the continuation of the predatory war that it is extremely probable that we shall at once obtain a truce and a consent to open peace negotiations. For the workers' revolution against the war is irresistibly growing everywhere, and it can be spurred on, not by phrases about peace (with which the workers and peasants have been deceived by <I>all</I> the imperialist governments including our own Kerensky government), but by a break with the capitalists and by the offer of peace. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If the least probable thing happens, i.e., if not a single belligerent state accepts even a truce, then as far as we are concerned the war becomes truly forced upon us, it becomes a truly just war of defence. If this is understood by the proletariat and the poor peasantry Russia will become many times stronger even in the military sense, especially after a complete break with the capitalists who are robbing the people; furthermore, under such conditions it would, as far as we are concerned, be a war in league with the oppressed classes of all countries, a war in league with the oppressed peoples of the whole world, not in word, but in deed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The people must be particularly cautioned against the capitalists' assertion which sometimes influences the petty bourgeoisie and others who are frightened, namely, that the British and other capitalists are capable of doing serious damage to the Russian revolution if we break the present predatory alliance with them. Such an assertion is false through and through, for "Allied financial aid" enriches the bankers and "supports" the Russian workers and peasants in exactly the same way as a rope supports a man who has been hanged. There is plenty of bread, coal, oil and iron in Russia; for these products to be properly distributed it is only necessary for us to rid ourselves of the landowners and capitalists who are robbing the people. As to the possibility of the Russian people being threatened 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 62</B></FONT><P>

with war by their present Allies, it is obviously absurd to assume that the French and Italians could unite their armies with those of the Germans and move them against Russia who offers a just peace. As to Britain, America, and Japan, even if they were to declare war against Russia (which for them is extremely difficult, both because of the extreme unpopularity of such a war among the masses and because of the divergence of material interests of the capitalists of those countries over the partitioning of Asia, especially over the plunder of China), they could not cause Russia one-hundredth part of the damage and misery which the war with Germany, Austria, and Turkey is causing her.

                                        LAND TO THOSE WHO TILL IT<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  4.&nbsp;The Soviet Government must immediately declare the abolition of private landed estates without compensation and place all these estates under the management of the peasant committees pending the solution of the problem by the Constituent Assembly. These peasant committees are also to take over all the landowners' stock and implements, with the proviso that they be placed primarily at the disposal of the poor peasants for their use free of charge. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such measures, which have long been demanded by an immense majority of the peasantry, both in the resolutions of congresses and in hundreds of mandates from local peasants<A NAME="p64"> (as may be seen, for instance, from a summary of 242 mandates published by <I>Izvestia Soveta Krestyanskikh Deputatov </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TTR17.html#en38">38</A>]</FONT>), are absolutely and urgently necessary. There must be no further procrastination like that from which the peasantry suffered so much at the time of the "coalition" government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Any government that hesitates to introduce these measures should be regarded as a government <I>hostile to the people</I> that should be overthrown and crushed by an uprising of the workers and peasants. On the other hand, only a government that realises these measures will be a government of all the people.

                         STRUGGLE AGAINST FAMINE AND ECONOMIC RUIN
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  5.&nbsp;The Soviet Government must immediately introduce workers' control of production and distribution on a nation-wide scale. Experience since May 6 has shown that in the absence of such control all the promises of reforms and attempts to introduce them are powerless, and famine, accompanied by unprecedented catastrophe is becoming a greater menace to the whole country week by week. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is necessary to nationalise the banks and the insurance business immediately, and also the most important branches of industry (oil, coal, metallurgy, sugar, etc.), and at the same time, to abolish commercial secrets and to establish unrelaxing supervision by the workers and peasants over the negligible minority of capitalists who wax rich on government contracts and evade accounting and just taxation of their profits and property. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such measures, which do not deprive either the middle peasants, the Cossacks or the small handicraftsmen of a single kopek, are urgently needed for the struggle against famine and are absolutely just because they distribute the burdens of the war equitably. Only after capitalist plunder has been curbed and the deliberate sabotage of production has been stopped will it be possible to work for an improvement in labour productivity, introduce universal labour conscription and the proper exchange of grain for manufactured goods, and return to the Treasury thousands of millions in paper money now being hoarded by the rich. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Without such measures, the abolition of the landed estates without compensation is also impossible, for the major part of the estates is mortgaged to the banks, so that the interests of the landowners and capitalists are inseparably linked up. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The latest resolution of the Economic Department of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies (<I>Rabochaya Gazeta</I> No. 152) recognises not only the "<I>harm </I>" caused by the government's measures (like the raising of grain prices for the enrichment of the landowners and kulaks), not only "the fact of the <I>complete inactivity</I> on the part of the central organs set up by the government for the regulation of economic life", 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 66</B></FONT><P>

but even the "contravention of the laws" by this government. This admission on the part of the ruling parties, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, proves once more the criminal nature of the policy of conciliation with the bourgeoisie.

                         STRUGGLE AGAINST THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION<BR>
                               OF THE LANDOWNERS AND CAPITALISTS<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  6.&nbsp;The Kornilov and Kaledin revolt was supported by the entire class of the landowners and capitalists, with the party of the Cadets ("people's freedom" party) at their head. This has already been fully proved by the facts published in <I>Izvestia</I> of the Central Executive Committee. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   However, nothing has been done either to suppress this counter-revolution completely or even to investigate it, and nothing serious can be done without the transfer of power to the Soviets. No commission can conduct a full investigation, or arrest the guilty, etc., unless it holds state power. Only a Soviet government can do this, and must do it. Only a Soviet government can make Russia secure against the otherwise inevitable repetition of "Kornilov" attempts by arresting the Kornilovite generals and the ringleaders of the bourgeois counter-revolution (Guchkov, Milyukov, Ryabushinsky, Maklakov and Co.), by disbanding the counter-revolutionary associations (the State Duma, the officers' unions, etc.), by placing their members under the surveillance of the local Soviets and by disbanding counter-revolutionary armed units. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This government alone can set up a commission to make a full and public investigation of the Kornilov case and all the other cases, even those started by the bourgeoisie; and the party of the Bolsheviks, in its turn, would appeal to the workers to give full co-operation and to submit only to such a commission. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Only a Soviet government could successfully combat such a flagrant injustice as the capitalists' seizure of the largest printing presses and most of the papers with the aid of millions<A NAME="p66"> squeezed out of the people. It is necessary to suppress the bourgeois counter-revolutionary papers (<I>Rech</I>, <I>Russkoye Slovo</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TTR17.html#en39">39</A>]</FONT> etc.), to confiscate their printing 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 67</B></FONT><P>

presses, to declare private advertisements in the papers a state monopoly, to transfer them to the paper published by the Soviets, the paper that tells the peasants the truth. Only in this way can and must the bourgeoisie be deprived of its powerful weapon of lying and slandering, deceiving the people with impunity, misleading the peasantry, and preparing a counter-revolution.

                         PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE REVOLUTION<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   7.&nbsp;A possibility very seldom to be met with in the history of revolutions now faces the democracy of Russia, the Soviets and the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties -- the possibility of convening the Constituent Assembly at the appointed date without further delays, of making the country secure against a military and economic catastrophe, and of ensuring the peaceful development of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If the Soviets now take full state power exclusively into their own hands for the purpose of carrying out the programme set forth above, they will not only obtain the support of nine-tenths of the population of Russia, the working class and an overwhelming majority of the peasantry; they will also be assured of the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm on the part of the army and the majority of the people, an enthusiasm without which victory over famine and war is impossible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There could be no question of any resistance to the Soviets if the Soviets themselves did not waver. No class will dare start an uprising against the Soviets, and the landowners and capitalists, taught a lesson by the experience of the Kornilov revolt, will give up their power peacefully and yield to the ultimatum of the Soviets. To overcome the capitalists' resistance to the programme of the Soviets, supervision over the exploiters by workers and peasants and such measures of punishing the recalcitrants as confiscation of their entire property coupled with a short term of arrest will be sufficient. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   By seizing full power, the Soviets could still today -- and this is probably their last chance -- ensure the peaceful development of the revolution, peaceful elections of deputies 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 68</B></FONT><P>

by the people, and a peaceful struggle of parties inside the Soviets; they could test the programmes of the various parties in practice and power could pass peacefully from one party to another. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The entire course of development of the revolution, from the movement of April 20 to the Kornilov revolt, shows that there is bound to be the bitterest civil war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat if this opportunity is missed. Inevitable catastrophe will bring this war nearer. It must end, as all data and considerations accessible to human reason go to prove, in the full victory of the working class, in that class, supported by the poor peasantry, carrying out the above programme; it may, however, prove very difficult and bloody, and may cost the lives of tens of thousands of landowners, capitalists, and officers who sympathise with them. The proletariat will not hesitate to make every sacrifice to save the revolution, which is possible only by implementing the programme set forth above. On the other hand, the proletariat would support the Soviets in every way if they were to make use of their last chance to secure a peaceful development of the revolution.

   <I>Izvestia Vserossiiskogo Soveta Krestyanskikh Deputatov</I> (<I>News of the All-Russia Soviet of Peasants' Deputies </I>) -- a daily, the official organ of the All-Russia Soviet of Peasants' Deputies, published in Petrograd from May 9 (22) to December 1917. It expressed the views of the Right wing of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. It met the October Socialist Revolution with hostility and was closed down for counter-revolutionary propaganda.

   <I>Russkoye Slovo</I>&nbsp;(<I>Russian Word </I>) -- a daily published in Moscow from 1895 (a pilot issue was published in 1894). Ostensibly independent, it took a moderately liberal attitude in the interests of the Russian bourgeoisie. In 1917, the paper sided with the bourgeois Provisional Government and bitterly attacked Lenin and the Bolshevik Party. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   In November 1917, it was closed down for carrying slanderous anti-Soviet reports. From January 1918, it appeared for a time under the name of <I>Novoye Slovo</I> (<I>New Word </I>) and <I>Nashe Slow</I> (<I>Our Word </I>). It was finally closed down in July 1918.
