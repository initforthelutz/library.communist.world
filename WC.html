   I had originally intended to debut <B>From Marx to Mao</B> on June 1, 1997, at which time there would be roughly twenty texts in the Lenin Library. However, <B>May Day</B> seemed a more appropriate date since <B>Capital, Vol. II</B> was already completed and sitting around. As such, I moved everything up by one month and hurried to have a little something for each of the respective Libraries. Since I have a number of texts from <B>Lenin</B> in a state of near completion, requiring only a little re-coding for greater compatibility with earlier versions of Internet browers and some cosmetic touch-ups, these texts will be coming on-line throughout the month of May.

<P>
  They include the following: 
<P>

<LI> A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism
<LI> Once More on the Theory of Realization
<LI> Review</A> -- Karl Kautsky's <I>Die Agrarfrage</I> (<I>The Agrarian Question</I> )
<LI> What Is To Be Done?
<LI> Why I Resigned from the <I>Iskra</I> Editorial Board. A Letter to the Editors of "Iskra"</I>
<LI> One Step Forward, Two Steps Back</A> (<I>The Crisis in Our Party </I>)  
<LI> One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. <I>Reply by N. Lenin to Rosa

<LI> Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution</A> 
<LI> Karl Marx</A> (<I>A Brief Biographical Sketch with an Exposition of Marxism </I>)
<LI> The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination
<LI> The Junius Pamphlet
<LI> The Discussion of Self-Determination Summed Up
<LI> The Nascent Trend of Imperialist Economism
<LI> Reply</A> to P. Kievsky (Y. Pyatakov) 
<LI> A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist Economism
<LI> Imperialism and the Split in Socialism

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I don't have a large number of texts planned for July (see below). Rather, the time has come for a little house-keeping. My intent is to update many of the files, i.e., add hypertext links, to reflect the additional texts in the various collections. Above all, I hope to update the "Reading Guide".

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
 Also, the "Which Browser?" section will be updated, for "low-end" Mac users, to reflect the release of Internet Explorer 3.01 (the post-beta release) for 68k platforms. My initial experience with it indicates, with respect to <I>this site</I>, that its "table" features (the only feature that counts here) offers no improvement over version 2.0x.  

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The reader may have noticed that this "What's Next?" feature always lists far fewer texts than actually end up appearing when I post new files. There are too many variables (primarily, the time I have available, the quality of the scans, and, of course, the condition of my "hacked" computer) that work against any accurate planning on my part. I would like to be able to promise in advance what I end up delivering, but the best I can do is deliver what I promise. As such, it appears that "What's Next?" will always list fewer texts than will actually be posted. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   As for the texts I hope to prepare for the month of July, they include the following. 

<P>
<B>Lenin:</B>
<LI> Social-Democracy and the Provisional Revolutionary Government (1905)
<LI> The Revolutionary-Democratic Dictatorship of the Proletariat and the Peasantry (1905)

   Having recently secured full-time employment, I regret to inform visitors to this site that the quantity of new material added each "month" will be greatly reduced. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Only one text is planned for the next posting: Lenin's <B><I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia.</I></B> My best guess is that the text will be from 1.4-1.6 MB in size and will not be available before the end of October. I hope to the have the full text ready by November 7, the 80th anniversary of the Great October Revolution.

   In the wake of today's posting of <I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</I>, I hope to have three of Lenin's texts which pre-date the above volume and to which Lenin frequently refers the reader.

   The new year in will bring a couple of additional "features" to <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B>. With any luck at all, by the first week of February there will be a search facility available for readers. This effort to beef-up the site with some "web-tech" will undoubtedly be very shakey at first, at least until I learn what I'm supposed to do to make it function properly. Once this feature is in place, <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B> will begin to carry Spanish versions of some of the classic texts of communist literature. Unfortunately, there is no way I can provide Spanish editions of all the documents currently available at this site, but the apparent paucity of such texts available in Spanish on the Internet needs to be corrected.  For a variety of technical reasons this will be slow-going, but <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B> is making a committment to begin to fill this void in the coming months.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In light of the above, January's postings will necessarily be few in number, but will include the following items:

<P>
<B>Marx:</B> 
<LI> Wage-Labour and Capital (1847)
<LI> The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852)
