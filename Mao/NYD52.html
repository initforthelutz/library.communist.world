   May all of us -- the cadres of the People's Government, the commanders and fighters of the People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, the democratic parties, the people's organizations, the minority nationalities and the people of the entire country -- win victory on every front of our work! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    May we win victory on the front of our movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Victory on the national defence front! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Victory on the agrarian reform front! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Victory on the front of our movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Victory on the economic and financial front! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Victory on the cultural and educational front! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Victory on the front of the ideological remoulding of people in all walks of life, and primarily of the intellectuals! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    I would also like to wish victory to a new front, that is, to the large-scale struggle in which all the people and cadres of the country are called upon to fight vigorously and resolutely against corruption, waste and bureaucracy, so as to cleanse our society of all the filth and poison left over from the old! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Comrades, in 1951 we scored victories, many of them very great ones, on all these fronts. We hope that by our common efforts we shall win still greater victories in all these tasks in 1952. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
