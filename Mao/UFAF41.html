<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    On June 22 the fascist rulers of Germany attacked the Soviet Union. This is a perfidious crime of aggression not only against the Soviet Union but against the freedom and independence of all nations. The Soviet Union's sacred war of resistance against fascist aggression is being waged not only in its own defence but in defence of all the nations struggling to liberate themselves from fascist enslavement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For Communists throughout the world the task now is to mobilize the people of all countries and organize an international united front to fight fascism and defend the Soviet Union, defend China, and defend the freedom and independence of all nations. In the present period, every effort must be concentrated on combating fascist enslavement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For the Chinese Communist Party the tasks throughout the country are as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     1.&nbsp; Persevere in the National United Front Against Japan, persevere in Kuomintang-Communist co-operation, drive the Japanese imperialists out of China, and by these means assist the Soviet Union. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     2.&nbsp; Resolutely combat all the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist activities of the reactionaries among the big bourgeoisie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     3.&nbsp; In foreign relations, unite against the common foe with every body in Britain, the United States and other countries who is opposed to the fascist rulers of Germany, Italy and Japan.
