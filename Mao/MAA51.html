    Herewith is the Draft Resolution on Mutual Aid and Co-operation in Agricultural Production which you are requested to print for distribution right down to the county and district Party committees. Please give prompt explanations inside and outside the Party in the spirit of this draft and arrange for its implementation. This is to be done in all areas where the agrarian reform has been completed, and please take it as a major task. This draft resolution may appear in inner Party publications but not in newspapers and periodicals for general circulation, as it is still a draft.

* Inner-Party circular of historic significance to rebuff Liu Shao-chi's opposition to the co-operative transformation of agriculture. In July 1951, behind the backs of Comrade Mao Tsetung and the Party Central Committee, Liu Shao-chi wrote and distributed a comment in his own name, wantonly attacking a report submitted by the Shansi Provincial Party Committee on promoting mutual aid and co-operation in agricultural production. In this comment, he opposed Comrade Mao Tsetung's line on the socialist transformation of agriculture, maligning it as an "erroneous, dangerous and utopian notion of agrarian socialism". In September of the same year, Comrade Mao Tsetung personally took charge of drafting the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Mutual Aid and Co-operation in Agricultural Production (Draft)", and on December 15 when the draft resolution was to be distributed he wrote this circular and instructed the whole Party to take mutual aid and co-operation in agriculture as a major task.
