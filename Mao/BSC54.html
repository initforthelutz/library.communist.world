Fellow Deputies,

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China opens today in our capital, Peking. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The total number of deputies is 1,226, of whom 1,211 have registered for attendance and 15 were unable to register on account of illness or for other reasons and asked for leave of absence; 70 who registered cannot take part today on account of illness or for other reasons. The actual number of deputies present at today's meeting is 1,141, which constitutes a quorum. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is charged with important tasks. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The tasks of the present session are: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    To adopt a constitution; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    To enact a number of important laws; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    To adopt the report on the work of the government; and 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    To elect the new leading personnel of the state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Our present session is of great and historic significance. It is a milestone marking the new victories and advances of our people since the founding of our People's Republic in 1949. The constitution to be adopted at this session will tremendously promote the socialist cause in our country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Our general task is to unite the whole people and win the support of all our friends abroad in the struggle to build a great socialist country, defend world peace and advance the cause of human progress. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The people of our country should work hard, do their best to draw on advanced experience in the Soviet Union and other fraternal coun-

tries, be honest and industrious, encourage and help each other, guard against boastfulness and arrogance and gird themselves to build our country, which is at present economically and culturally backward, into a great industrialized country with a high standard of modern culture in the course of several five-year plans. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Ours is a just cause. A just cause is invincible before any enemy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The force at the core leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are fully confident that we can overcome all difficulties and hardships and make our country a great socialist republic. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are advancing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We are now engaged in a great and most glorious cause, never undertaken by our forefathers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our goal must be attained. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our goal can unquestionably be attained. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Let all the 600 million people of our country unite and strive for our common cause! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Long live our great motherland!
