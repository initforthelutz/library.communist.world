   It is with the greatest optimism that we celebrate the anniversary of the October Revolution this year. I firmly believe that this anniversary marks the turning point not only of the Soviet-German war, but also of the victory of the world anti-fascist front over the fascist front. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Hitler was previously able to keep up the offensive without being defeated because the Red Army was alone in resisting fascist Germany and its accomplices in Europe. Now the Soviet Union has grown more powerful in the course of the war and Hitler's second summer offensive has failed. Henceforward the task of the world anti-fascist front is to take the offensive against the fascist front and inflict final defeat on fascism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The warriors of the Red Army at Stalingrad have performed prodigies of heroism which will affect the destiny of mankind. They are the sons and daughters of the October Revolution. The banner of the October Revolution is invincible, and all the forces of fascism are doomed to extinction. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In celebrating the victory of the Red Army, we the Chinese people are also celebrating our own victory. Our War of Resistance Against Japan has been going on for more than five years, and although there are still difficulties ahead the dawn of victory is already in sight. Victory over the Japanese fascists is not only certain but is not far off. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It is the task of the Chinese people to concentrate every effort on beating the Japanese fascists.
