<UL>
<P>
<B>May 24, 1997</B>
<BR>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   When <B>From Marx to Mao</B> debuted on May 1, 1997, there were, to be sure, very few texts in the collection. At that time, I promised that "a number of texts from <B>Lenin</B>" would "be coming on-line throughout the month of May." They included the following: 
<P>

<LI> A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism (1897) 
<LI> Once More on the Theory of Realization (1899) 
<LI> Review -- Karl Kautsky's <I>Die Agrarfrage</I> (<I>The Agrarian Question</I> ) (1899) 
<LI> What Is To Be Done? (1902) 
<LI> Why I Resigned from the <I>Iskra</I> Editorial Board. A Letter to the Editors of "Iskra"</I> (1904) 
<LI> One Step Forward, Two Steps Back(<I>The Crisis in Our Party </I>) (1904) 
<LI> One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. <I>Reply by N. Lenin to Rosa
Luxemburg</I> (1904)
<LI> Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution (1905)
<LI> Karl Marx (<I>A Brief Biographical Sketch with an Exposition of Marxism </I>) (1914)
<LI> The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination (1916)
<LI> The Junius Pamphlet (1916)
<LI> The Discussion of Self-Determination Summed Up (1916)
<LI> The Nascent Trend of Imperialist Economism (1916)
<LI> Reply to P. Kievsky (Y. Pyatakov) (1916)
<LI> A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist Economism (1916)
<LI> Imperialism and the Split in Socialism (1916)
<LI> The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky (1918)
<LI> The State (1919)

<BR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Although I failed to deliver with respect to coming on-line <I>throughout</I> the month of May, <B>all</B> of these texts are now <B>available</B> and include many of Lenin's <B>major</B> pieces. In addition, the following items from Lenin have <B>also</B> been <B>added</B>.
<P>

<LI> A Note on the Question of the Market Theory (1898)
<LI> The Workers' Party and the Peasantry (1901)
<LI> Where to Begin? (1901)
<LI> A Letter to a Comrade on Our Organizational Tasks (1902)
<LI> The National Question in Our Programme (1903)
<LI> Letter to <I>Iskra</I> (1904)
<LI> The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism (1913)
<LI> "Cultural-National" Autonomy (1913)
<LI> The National Program of the R.S.D.L.P. (1913)
<LI> Critical Remarks on the National Question (1913)
<LI> The Right of Nations to Self-Determination (1914)
<LI> Socialism and War (1915)
<LI> The Revolutionary Proletariat and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination (1915)
<LI> The Military Programme of the Proletarian Revolution (1916)

<BR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
The <B>thematic foci</B> of all of this material, which spans the years 1897-1919, includes the exposition and defense of the fundamental tenets of Marxism, and the application of these principles to the development of capitalism and the agrarian question, problems and issues of organization, and the national question in the era of imperialism.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Although providing access to the writtings of Lenin is the <I>immediate</I> goal of <B>From Marx to Mao</B>, a handful of <B>Stalin's</B> briefer pieces from 1905-06 are now available also:

<P>
<LI> Briefly About the Disagreements in the Party (1905) [-- this should be read in conjunction with <I>One Step Forward</I>, <I>Two Steps Back </I> --]
<LI> Armed Insurrection and Our Tactics (1905)
<LI> A Reply to <I>Social-Democrat</I> (1905)
<LI> Two Clashes (1906)
<LI> The Present Situation and the Unity Congress of the Workers' Party (1906)
<LI> Marx and Engels on Insurrection (1906)
<LI> The Class Struggle (1906)

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And finally, two texts from <B>Mao</B> dating from "The First Revolutionary Civil War Period" (1924-27) and "The Second Revolutionary Civil War Period" (1928-37), respectively:
<P>
<LI> Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan (1927)
<LI> Win the Masses in Their Millions for the Anti-Japanese National United Front (1937)

   This "update" is, shall we say, a "downpayment" on the committments I made in the last "<A HREF="WC.html#May24y97">What's Coming</A>?" (May 24, 1997); the texts are marked with an (*). There are also a few additional texts not mentioned at that time. The remaining texts constituting my committment for June should be available before the end of the month. A complete listing of the new texts now available at this site is given below.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   As of today, visitors to <B>From Marx to Mao</B> will now have access to a "topical" <A HREF="RG.html"><B>Reading Guide</B></A> that is in its initial stage of development. The aim here is to draw together texts from the various "Libraries" which focus (more or less) on specific themes. Nearly all of the files in this site have been "updated" to provide access to this guide from any text. I hope it proves to be useful. 


<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Another new feature attempts to offer <B>Some "<A HREF="TH.html">Not Too Technical Help</A>"</B> for  Mac users, especially "Low-End" users like myself.

   The first thing that's new is the Home Page. This is my dismal attempt to be a little spiffier. If you're running Netscape you may (probably?) see "flecks"; it's not your machine. (It's my continuing inability to solve this problem.) A switch to Internet Explorer will (should) eliminate them.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
    This is the last posting for the month of June. The "balance" of the committments I made in the "<A HREF="WC.html#May24y97">What's Coming</A>?" of May 24, 1997, marked with an (*), have been met. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The three items by Marx and Engels are from a Chinese edition "booklet" and form a single file; in accessing one, you access all three texts. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Although never mentioned in "What's Coming?", I have posted some additional (and important) texts by Lenin dating from before the October Revolution thru early 1923 that focus on the dictatorship of the proletariat, the relationship of the trade unions to the Soviet state, and other aspects of socialist construction.  

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
    I have also posted a couple of additional texts by Stalin from 1924. There will be more of his essays and speeches from the '20s and '30s coming on-line in the months ahead.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Finally, I've prepared a few more texts from Mao dating from the early 1940s that focus on strategy, leadership and culture.

   This is the one and only posting planned for July. Aside from updating the  links of many of the already-available-texts in <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B> and updating the <B>Reading Guide</B>, a new section has been added to accommodate other important documents. Simply titled "Other", this heading, at present, has only one item: a document prepared by The Chinese Communist Party entitled <I>On Khrushchov's Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World</I> (1964).

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Since the primary aim of <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B> is to provide access to the texts of Lenin and Stalin, nearly all of the new items are from their respective <I>Works</I>. The new texts from Lenin include items written on the eve of the First Russian Revolution and documents following after the Great October Revolution. Included among the latter are Lenin's speeches before the first four annual meetings of the Communist (Third) International, as well as those given before the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) that laid out the New Economic Policy and the "tax in kind". Also available is the full text of Lenin's phamphet <I>The Tax in Kind</I> and a variety of briefer texts speaking to issues related to the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist consolidation. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The new texts added to the Stalin collection include a rethinking of the National Question as it pertains to countries oppressed by imperialism and a series of pieces dealing with the state of the Chinese Revolution in the late 1920s. Lastly, there is his (in)famous 1936 text "On the Draft Constitution of the U.S.S.R." where the class struggle is declared to be over.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Finally, there is Mao's "On the Ten Major Relationships". It is well worth noting that this is the "official" version from Volume 5 of the <I>Selected Works</I> (1977) and differs considerably (and importantly) from the "unofficial" version that circulated during the period of the Cultural Revolution (1966-69). The "unofficial" version can be found in Stuart Scham's <I>Chairman Mao Talks to the People</I>, <I>1956-71</I> (U.S.A.) or <I>Mao Tse-tung Unrehearsed: Talks and Letters: 1956-71</I> (U.K.).

   The new texts appearing in the August posting include Lenin's first lengthy excursion into philosophy, <I>Materialism and Empirio-Criticism</I> (1908) (which can be downloaded in its entirety (795k) or in three parts), and Stalin's (in)famous and much briefer text on <I>Dialectical and Historical Materialism</I> (1938). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Aside from the most notable addition to the Lenin Library, there are additional texts on the agrarian question (and more coming in the future) dating from the period of the first Russian Revolution, as well as brief pieces on the question of religion and early revisionism, and finally a few items from the period of the October Revolution. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The additions to the Stalin collection focus on the "opposition bloc" (Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev) of the mid-1920s, the "right deviation" group (Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky) of the last quarter of the '20s, and the abandonment of NEP with the collectivization of agriculture at the end of that decade. The character of the relationship with the various strata of the peasantry looms large in nearly all of these texts and very explicitly in other documents added today. Although not at all obvious from its title, "Notes on Contemporay Themes" (1927) contains a lengthy discussion of the state of the Chinese Revolution. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Since many of the items in the Stalin Library come from two collections, <I>On the Opposition</I> and <I>Problems of Leninism</I>, a table of contents for all of the texts in these respective anthologies is now available. The reader can access either an abrieviated version of the table of contents, listing just the titles of the essays, articles and speeches contain therein, or a complete table of contents detailing the sections and sub-sections of those items so divided.

Except for Lenin's "Notes of a Publicist", which deals with the struggle within the Party and should be read in conjuction with his "The Historical Meaning of the Inner-Party Stuggle in Russia", the subject matter addressed in the new material for both Lenin and Stalin is clear from the titles.

   Today marks the 80th anniversary of the October Revolution and the four new texts posted today are offered in commemoration of what is arguably the most significant event of the twentieth century (unless you're an anti-communist, in which case it may be the second most important event, the first being the "collapse of the Soviet Union"). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Although few in number, at least three of the four new items must be classed among the "classics" of Communist literature. At long last, what Engels characterized as "undoubtedly the most widespread, the most international production of all Socialist literature," <I>viz</I>, the <I>Manifesto of the Communist Party</I>, is finally available at this site.  So too is a brief pamphlet by Engels which in Marx's opinion "constitutes . . . an <I>introduction to scientific socialism </I>": <I>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</I>. (Both were a long time coming; many thanks to M. D. for the loan of these texts.)  

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Turning now to Lenin. The last "What's Coming?" (27 Sept 97), announced that <I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</I> would be available beginning today and so it is. Lenin worked on this book for three years (1896-1899 -- during which time he wrote numerous articles and pamphlets besides) and produced what to this day remains a model of research and analysis. This text is a "must read", for it forms the basis for Lenin's subsequent writings on the agrarian question.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Nearly 600 pages in book form, the complete text of <I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</I> (tables, graphs, diagrams and all) weighs-in at 1.9MB!!&nbsp;However, unlike the all the other texts in the Lenin Library, there is no single unified file from which to chose; you have to access the text in chunks. In calling up the file from the directory in the Lenin Library, you will have the complete and very detailed table of contents of the text before you. From there you will be able to access the various chapters. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The final item, "Uncritical Criticism," is a brief piece by Lenin in which he responds to an unfavourable review of <I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</I>.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The first three items in todays posting pre-date <I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</I> and show the manner in which Lenin analysed numerical data from a variety of sources. Lenin brings his considerable analytic skills and theoretical grasp to bare in demonstrating how one extracts what is useful from "raw data" and avoids being misled by the ideological character in which it is often couched. They are the first fruits of Lenin's investigation into the process of differentiation within the countryside and the transformation from manufacturing to large-scale industry in pre-Revolutionary Russia. Lenin often referred to these texts in <I>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</I> and each is directly accessable from within this larger volume.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The last three items are very brief. Written at the time of the first Russian Revolution, they take up themes which recur throughout the period and which have general application. They are the first installment of a series of texts focusing on this period that will be available at this site in the coming months.

<B>Lenin:</B>

   This last posting of the year includes a wide variety of texts. The items by Marx and Engels focus of the revolutionary (and counter-revolutionary) events of 1848-50 and those of Lenin on the revolutionary period 1905-06. I have also included a few of Lenin's pre-revolutionary texts directed against "economism". Readers might also be interested in his "Preface to the Collection <I>Twelve Years.</I>" The "collection" contained various texts written by Lenin, and in the "Preface" he identifies his most important pieces, thereby presenting his own "reading guide" to his early works.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
    The documents by Stalin date from the late 20s with the culmination of the critique of the "left" and the beginning of the assault on the "right". Of particular interest is his 1928 text, "Industrialisation of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U.(B.)", which contains the propositions on industrialization and collectivization that would form the basis of the rationale for abandoning NEP in the following year.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Finally, there are two items for the near-stillborn "Other Text and Documents" section of <B>From Marx to Mao</B>. The first is a brief piece from the last years of the Cultural Revolution (1975) by one of "The Four", Chang Chun-chiao -- "On Exercising All-Round Dictatorship Over the Bourgeoisie". The second is a text by Etienne Balibar, a French Marxist-Leninist, entitled <I>On the Dictatorship of Proletariat.</I> Published in France in 1976, the text was part of the struggle waged inside the Communist Party of France against the Party's decision (at the 22nd Party Congress) to "abandon" the dictatorship of the proletariat in favor of the "peaceful, democratic road to socialism." <B>This text is well worth studying</B>.

   In this month's postings each of the "collections" has at least one new item. To the Marx and Engels holding a few early texts by Marx and some latter pieces by Engels have been added. Visitors interested in the period of the First Russian Revolution will find many additional documents penned by Lenin. Two new documents have been added to the Stalin collection dating from 1924 and the Thirteenth Party Conference and Congress (the first following Lenin's death). Mao's "Combat Liberalism" is finally available here, and lastly, "The Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" by the Communist Party of China has been added to the section on "Other Texts and Documents". This last item marks the opening assault on "modern revisionism" (circa 1956) and will be followed in the coming months by other documents from the CPC focusing on this problem.

   Since considerable time has been devoted to setting up the Spanish language section of this site, which will go on-line May 1, 1998, little time was available for preparing other texts. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The bulk of the documents in today's posting fall under the heading <B><A HREF="Other/Index.html">Other Texts and Documents</B></A>. Most are from the Communist Party of China and consist of seven texts rounding out the collection found in the <I>Polemic on the General Line of the International Communist Movement.</I> A complete listing of contents (including sections within individual articles) is accessable from the directory.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Two other texts have been added to this section which, unlike the other documents, have, perhaps, less "general" applicability since they address an issue more specific to the United States. The first item consists of the "complete, unaltered texts" of the 1928 and 1930 Comintern Resolutions on the "Negro Question" (dubbed the "Black National Question" in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and more recently something akin to the "African-American National Question"). The second text, a pamphlet published in 1975 by the Racism Research Project, offers a <I>Critique of the Black Nation Thesis.</I>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Today marks the First Anniversary of <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B>. During the past year it has developed from an obscure "infant library" into a less obscure site containing nearly 300 texts (from the very short to the very long). None of this would have been possible without the support, both direct and indirect, the site has received from "visitors" from around the world. Indirect support in the form of encouraging e-mail messages and suggestions from individuals in Australia, India, Japan, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have helped to keep morale high, and the direct support given by individuals who have put up with numerous requests for material and done the "leg-work" that otherwise would not have been done, have made <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B> the site it is. It would never have gotten this far without them!

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   At the first of the year, <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B> made a committment to turn its attention toward developing a Spanish-language edition of the site. Today's postings are the first fruits of that effort. There is no expectation that <B><A HREF="M2M(SP)/index(sp).html">DESDE MARX HASTA MAO</A></B> will ever be as extensive as the English-language collections, but it will (in due time) contain many, if not most, of the central texts of Marxism-Leninism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Unfortunately, as I warned readers last time, there are NO English-language postings today. Sorry.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Although there was no entry at all last time for "What's Coming?", there was enough time (after having satisfied the committments in the Spanish-language section) to prepare a few texts by Lenin and a single item by Stalin.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Today's posting also includes a new section with a handful of links to other sites. It's no big deal. It includes a couple of sites, each of which provides an index of the vast number of left-wing sites that exist; a couple of sites offering news about political developments in Eastern Europe; a "list" where polemical exchanges are posted, as well as new items from Latin America and Australia; and finally a site that offer texts, many of which are not available here. Since <B>FROM MARX TO MAO</B> is a library of Marxist-Leninist texts seeking to provide a resource for Communists world-wide, any attempt made to provide a listing of the numerous Marxist-Leninist organizations is bound to offend, all the more since I am ill-equiped to make the necessary political judgements.

     This posting ends two years of inactivity for this cite. This extended "break" was prompted by a decision to prepare a CD containing the "official" 13 volume collection of Stalin's <I>Works</I>, as well as those of Mao's <I> Selected Works</I>, and to present these volumes as PDF files for viewing in Acrobat Reader. As work on this progressed, the plan of the project expanded beyond these modest goals to include other material, and while much of this additional material has been prepared, there are yawning gaps which are stalling completion of the project. Since it is now doubtful that these gaps will be filled in the near future, and perhaps never (some "comrades" are very flakey when its comes to following through on committments), there is no point in "waiting" any longer. Rather than incur the expense of producing, and offering for sale, an incomplete CD, the PDF versions of material that is now widely available on the Web only as HTML files will be posted in the coming months. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
     Since PDF files can be 2-3 times larger than their HTML counterparts, and since the material available for downloading will be entire volumes, the files range in size from 1mb - 2.5 mb. While downloading these files will present no problem for those with broadband, those without such access will clearly have difficulty, or possibly be prevented altogether from, accessing these volumes. <B>IF</B> this is the case, and <B>IF</B> there are "enough" complaints about being shut-out from accessing these files, <B>IF</B> the "demand" for these files exists, the prospect of preparing an incomplete, modest CD will again become something to give serious consideration.

<LI> These two volumes mark the last of those containing the major writings of Lenin that had a public, or in many instances, a semi-public, status. Although there are a few items of special note (e.g., Letter to Congress, aka Lenin's so-called "Testament", The Question of Nationalities or "Autonomisation", Journal of Lenin's Duty Secretaries, November 21, 1922-March 6, 1923) included in the remaining volumes, the latter consist mainly of letters and notebooks (e.g., on imperialism and the agrarian question). The preparation of these last volumes will not necessarily proceed in order of volume number.

Some time ago somebody posted a PDF version of these texts, but they are merely the result <BR>
of having used a program to convert the originally flawed html filles; the newly corrected version<BR>
of these volumes has provided an opportunity for our own original preparatiion of PDF files for each<BR>
volume which, at this point in time, supersedes anything out there.
