   As you are undoubtedly aware, the <B>Marx/Engels</B> selections in this site are not numerous. If any of you have access to the Chinese editions of any texts (e. g., <I>Class Struggles in France, 1848-1850 </I>), would you be willing to loan them (or sell them) to me? They will be returned to you in the same condition as I received them. That is a promise! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A special thanks to those who have trusted me with their material(s) or provided me with photocopies of important texts.
