</I></FONT></B></CENTER><BR><BR>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  I think that your letter of May 2 of this year provides neither occasion nor grounds for a reply in detail, point by point, so to speak. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As a matter of fact, it offers nothing particularly new as compared with Yan-sky's letter. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If, nevertheless, I am replying to your letter it is because it contains certain elements of a direct revival of Kamenev's ideas of the period of April-May 1917. It is only in order to expose these elements of a revival of Kamenev's ideas that I consider it necessary to reply briefly to your letter. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   1)&nbsp;You say in your letter that "in fact, in the period from February to October we had the slogan of alliance <I>with the  whole</I> of the peasantry," that "in the period from February to October the Party upheld and defended its <I>old</I> slogan in 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 254</B></FONT><P>

relation to the peasantry -- Alliance <I>with the whole</I> peasantry." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  It follows, firstly, that in the period of preparation for October (April-October 1917) the Bolsheviks did not set themselves the task of drawing a demarcation line between the poor peasants and the well-to-do peasants, but treated the peasantry as an integral whole.  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  It follows, secondly, that in the period of preparation for October the Bolsheviks did not replace the old slogan, "Dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry," by a new slogan, "Dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry," but maintained the old position laid down in Lenin's pamphlet <I><A HREF="http://marx2mao.phpwebhosting.com/Lenin/TT04.html">Two Tactics</A></I> in 1905. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It follows, thirdly, that the Bolshevik policy of combating the vacillations and compromising policy of the Soviets in the period of preparation for October (March-October 1917), the vacillations of the middle peasantry in the Soviets and at the front, the vacillations between revolution and counter-revolution, the vacillations and compromising policy which assumed a particularly acute character in the July days, when the Soviets, headed by the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik compromisers, joined hands with the counter-revolutionary generals in the attempt to isolate the Bolsheviks -- it appears that the Bolshevik fight against these vacillations and the compromising policy of certain strata of the peasantry was pointless and absolutely unnecessary. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It follows, finally, that Kamenev was right when, in April May 1917, he defended the old slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, while Lenin, who regarded this slogan as already out-of-date and who proclaimed the new slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry, was wrong. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 255</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One need only raise these issues to realize the utter absurdity of your letter as a whole. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But since you are very fond of isolated quotations from Lenin's works, let us turn to quotations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It does not require much effort to prove that what Lenin regarded as <I>new</I> in the agrarian relations in Russia after the February Revolution, from the point of view of the further development of the revolution, was not a community of interests of the proletariat and the peasantry as a whole, but the <I>cleavage</I> between the poor peasantry and the well-to-do peasantry, of whom the former, i.e., the poor peasantry, gravitated towards the proletariat, whereas the latter, i.e., the well-to-do peasantry, followed the Provisional Government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Here is what Lenin said on this score in <I>April</I> 1917, in his polemic against Kamenev and Kamenev's ideas: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It would be impermissible for the proletarian party <I>now </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="DPPP27.html#fnp255">*</A>]</FONT> to place hopes in a community of interests with the peasantry." (See <I>Lenin's</I> speech at the April Conference, 1917, Vol. XX, p. 245.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Further:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Already we can discern in the decisions of a number of peasant congresses the idea of postponing the solution of the agrarian question until the Constituent Assembly; this represents a victory for the <I>well-to-do peasantry</I>,* which inclines towards the Cadets." (See <I>Lenin's</I> speech at the Petrograd City Conference, April 1917, Vol. XX, p. 176.)
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
   Further:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It is possible that the peasantry may seize all the land and the entire power. Far from forgetting this possibility, far from limiting my outlook to the present day alone, I definitely and clearly formulate the agrarian programme, taking into account the new phenomenon, i.e., the deeper <I>cleavage </I>* between the agricultural labourers and poor peasants on the one hand, and the prosperous peasants on the other." (See <I>Lenin's</I> article written in April, "<A HREF="../Lenin/LOT17.html">Letters on Tactics</A>," Vol. XX, p. 103.) </FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is what Lenin regarded as <I>new</I> and <I>important</I> in the new situation in the countryside after the February Revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    That was Lenin's starting point in shaping the Party's policy in the period after February 1917. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    That thesis was Lenin's starting point when, at the Petrograd City Conference in April I917, he said: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It was only here, on the spot, that we learnt that the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies had surrendered its power to the Provisional Government. The Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies represents the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat and soldiers; among the latter, the majority are peasants. This is the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. But this 'dictatorship' has entered into an agreement with the bourgeoisie. And it is here that <I>a revision of the 'old' Bolsbevism is needed</I>."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="DPPP27.html#fnp256">*</A>]</FONT> (See Vol. XX, p. 176.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That thesis also was Lenin's starting point when, in April 1917, he wrote: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Whoever speaks <I>now</I> only of a 'revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry' is behind the times, has consequently in fact <I>gone over</I> to the side of the petty bourgeoisie against the proletarian class struggle. He deserves to be consigned to the archive of 'Bolshevik' pre-revolutionary antiques (which might be called the archive of 'Old Bolsheviks')." (See Vol. XX, p. 101.)<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It was on this basis that there arose the slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and <I>poor</I> peasantry <I>in place of</I> the old slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    You may say, as indeed you do in your letter, that this is a Trotskyite skipping over of the still uncompleted peasant revolution; but that would be just as convincing as the similar objection which Kamenev raised against Lenin in April 1917.

"Letters on Tactics."
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 257</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Lenin took this objection fully into account when he said: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Trotskyism says: 'No tsar, but a workers' government.' That is incorrect. The petty bourgeoisie exists, and it cannot be left out of account. But it consists of two sections. The <I>poorer </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="DPPP27.html#fnp257">*</A>]</FONT> section follows the working class." (See Vol. XX, p. 182.)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="DPPP27.html#fnp257">1</A>]</FONT>
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Kamenev's error, and now yours, consists in the inability to discern and emphasize the difference between the two sections of the petty bourgeoisie, in this case the peasantry; in the inability to <I>single out</I> the poor section of the peasantry from the mass of the peasantry as a whole, and on that basis to <I>shape</I> the Party's policy in the situation of the transition from the first stage of the revolution in 1917 to its second stage, in the inability to <I>deduce</I> from this the new slogan, the Party's second strategic slogan, concerning the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Let us trace in consecutive order in Lenin's works the practical history of the slogan "Dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry" from April to October 1917. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <I>April</I> 1917: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The specific feature of the present situation in Russia consists in the transition from the first* stage of tbe revolution -- which, owing to the insufficient class consciousness and organization of the proletariat, placed the power in the hands of the bourgeoisie -- <I>to the second</I> stage, which must place the power in the hands of the proletariat and the "<I>poor strata of tbe peasantry</I>.*" (See <I>Lenin's</I> April Theses, Vol. XX, p. 88.)<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT></FONT>

This has not yet been tried, and you, gentlemen of <I>Novaya Zhizn</I>, are <I>dissuading</I> the people from this, trying to frighten them with your own fear of the bourgeoisie. No fourth way can be invented." (See Vol. XXI, p. 275.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such are the facts. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You "successfully" <I>evade</I> all these facts and events in the history of the preparation for October; you "successfully" erase from the history of Bolshevism the <I>struggle</I> waged by the Bolsheviks in the period of preparation for October against the <I>vacillations</I> and the <I>compromising</I> policy of the "prosperous peasants" who were in the Soviets at that time; you "successfully" <I>bury</I> Lenin's slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry, and at the same time imagine that this is not to do <I>violence</I> to history, to Leninism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From these quotations, which could be multiplied, you must see that the Bolsheviks took as their starting point after February 1917 not the peasantry as a whole, but the poor section of the peasantry; that they marched towards October not under the <I>old</I> slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, but under the <I>new</I> slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From this it is evident that the Bolsheviks put this slogan into effect in a fight against the vacillations and compromising policy of the Soviets, against the vacillations and compromising policy of a certain section of the peasantry inside the Soviets, against the vacillations and compromising policy of

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 260</B></FONT><P>

certain parties representing petty-bourgeois democracy and known as Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From this it is evident that without the new slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry we would have been unable to assemble a sufficiently powerful political army, one capable of overcoming the compromising policy of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, of neutralizing the vacillations of a certain section of the peasantry, of overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie, and of thus making it possible to carry the bourgeois revolution to completion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From this it is evident that "we marched towards October and achieved victory in October together with the poor peasantry against the resistance of the kulaks (also peasants) and with the middle peasantry vacillating." (See my <A HREF="SPQ27.html">reply to Yan-sky</A>.)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="DPPP27.html#fnp260">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus, it follows that in April 1917, as also during the whole period of preparation for October, it was Lenin who was right, and not Kamenev; and you, by now reviving Kamenev's ideas, seem to be getting into not very good company. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   2)&nbsp;As against all that has been said above you quote Lenin's words to the effect that in October 1917 we took power with the support of the peasantry <I>as a whole</I>. That we took power with a <I>certain amount</I> of support from the peasantry as a whole is quite true. But you forgot to add a "detail," namely, that the peasantry <I>as a whole</I> supported us in October, and after October, only <I>in so far</I> as we carried the bourgeois revolution to completion. That is a very important "detail," which in the present instance settles the issue. To

&nbsp &nbsp 
* See this volume, pp. 247-48. --<I>Ed</I>.
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 261</B></FONT><P>

"forget" such an important "detail" and thus slur over a most important issue is impermissible for a Bolshevik. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From your letter it is evident that you <I>counterpose</I> what Lenin said about the support of the peasantry <I>as a whole</I> to the Party's slogan of "Dictatorship of the proletariat and <I>poor</I> peasantry," which was also advanced by Lenin. But in order to counterpose these words of Lenin to the previous quotations from the works of Lenin, in order to have grounds for refuting the previous quotations from Lenin on the slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry by the words you quote from Lenin about the peasantry as a whole, two things, at least, must be proved. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Firstly</I>. It must be proved that the completion of the bourgeois revolution was the <I>main thing</I> in the October Revolution. Lenin considered that the completion of the bourgeois revolution was a "<I>by-product </I>" of the October Revolution, which fulfilled this task "<I>in passing</I>." You must first of all refute this thesis of Lenin's and prove that the <I>main thing</I> in the October Revolution was not the overthrow of the power of the bourgeoisie and the transfer of power to the proletariat, but the completion of the bourgeois revolution. Try to prove that, and if you do I shall be ready to admit that from April to October 1917 the Party's slogan was not the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry, but the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   From your letter it is evident that you do not think it possible to undertake this more than risky task; you try, however, to prove "in passing" that on one of the most important questions of the October Revolution, the question of peace, we were supported by <I>all</I> the peasantry as a whole. That, of course, is untrue. It is quite untrue. On the question of peace you have slipped into the viewpoint of the philistine. As a matter 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 262</B></FONT><P>

of fact the question of peace was for us at that time a question of power, for only with the transfer of power to the proletariat could we count on extricating ourselves from the imperialist war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   You must have forgotten Lenin's words, that "the only way to stop the war is by the transfer of power to another class," and that " 'Down with the war' does not mean flinging away your bayonets. It means the transfer of power to another class." (See <I>Lenin's</I> speech at the Petrograd City Conference, April 1917, Vol. XX, pp. 181 and I78.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus, one thing or the other: either you must prove that the <I>main thing</I> in the October Revolution was the completion of the bourgeois revolution, or you cannot prove it; in the latter case the obvious conclusion is that the peasantry <I>as a whole</I> could support us in October only <I>in so far</I> as we carried the bourgeois revolution to completion, doing away with the monarchy, and with the property and regime of the landlords. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Secondly</I>. You must prove that the Bolsheviks could have secured the support of the peasantry as a whole in October and after October, in so far as they carried the bourgeois revolution to completion, <I>without</I> systematically putting into effect the slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and <I>poor</I> peasantry during the whole period of preparation for October; <I>without</I> a systematic struggle, arising from this slogan, against the compromising policy of the petty-bourgeois parties; <I>without</I> a systematic exposure, arising from the same slogan, of the vacillations of certain strata of the peasantry and of their representatives in the Soviets. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Try to prove that. In point of fact, why did we succeed in securing the support of the peasantry as a whole in October and after October? Because we had the possibility of carrying the bourgeois revolution to completion. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 263</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Why did we have that possibility? Because we succeeded in overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie and replacing it by the power of the proletariat, which alone is able to carry the bourgeois revolution to completion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Why did we succeed in overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie and establishing the power of the proletariat? Because we prepared for October under the slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and <I>poor</I> peasantry; because, proceeding from this slogan, we waged a systematic struggle against the compromising policy of the petty-bourgeois parties; because, proceeding from this slogan, we waged a systematic struggle against the vacillations of the middle peasantry in the Soviets; because <I>only with such a slogan</I> could we overcome the vacillations of the middle peasant, defeat the compromising policy of the petty-bourgeois parties, and rally a political army capable of waging the struggle for the transfer of power to the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It scarcely needs proof that without these preliminary conditions, which determined the fate of the October Revolution, we could not have won the support of the peasantry <I>as a whole</I> for the task of completing the bourgeois revolution, either in October or after October. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is how the combination of peasant wars with the proletarian revolution should be understood. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is why to <I>counterpose</I> the support of the peasantry as a whole in October and after October as regards completing the bourgeois revolution to the fact that the preparation for the October Revolution was made under the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat and <I>poor</I> peasantry means <I>to understand nothing of Leninism</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Your principal error is that you have failed to understand either the fact of the interweaving during the October Rev-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 264</B></FONT><P>

olution of <I>socialist</I> tasks with the tasks of completing the <I>bourgeois</I> revolution, or the mechanics of fulfilling the various demands of the October Revolution arising from the Party's second strategic slogan, the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Reading your letter one might think that it was not we who took the peasantry into the service of the proletarian revolution, but, on the contrary, that is was "the peasantry as a whole," including the kulaks, who took the Bolsheviks into their service. Things would go badly with the Bolsheviks if they so easily "entered" the service of non-proletarian classes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Kamenev's ideas of the period of April 1917 -- that is what is fettering you. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    3)&nbsp;You assert that Stalin does not see any difference between the situation in 1905 and the situation in February 1917. That, of course, is not to be taken seriously. I never said that, and could not have said it. In my letter I said merely that the Party's slogan on the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, issued in 1905, received confirmation in the February Revolution of 1917. That, of course, is true. That is exactly how Lenin described the situation in his article "Peasants and Workers" in August 1917:

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Only the proletariat and the peasantry can overthrow the monarchy --  such was the fundamental definition of our class policy for that time (i.e., 1905 -- <I>J. St.</I>). And that definition was a correct one. <I>February and March have confirmed this once again</I>."* (See Vol. XXI, p. 111.)

   You simply want to find fault. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   4)&nbsp;You try, further, to convict Stalin of contradicting himself, by counterposing his thesis on the compromising policy of the middle peasant before October to a quotation from

Stalin's pamphlet <I>Problems of Leninism</I>, which speaks of the possibility of building socialism jointly with the middle peasantry after the dictatorship of the proletariat has been consolidated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It does not require much effort to prove that such an identification of two different phenomena is utterly unscientific. The middle peasant before October, when the bourgeoisie was in power, and the middle peasant after the dictatorship of the proletariat has been consolidated, when the bourgeoisie has already been overthrown and expropriated, when the co-operative movement has developed and the principal means of production are concentrated in the hands of the proletariat, are two different things. To identify these two kinds of middle peasant and to put them on a par means to examine phenomena out of connection with their historical setting and to lose all sense of perspective. It is something like the Zinoviev manner of mixing up all dates and periods when quoting. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If that is what is called "revolutionary dialectics," it must be admitted that Pokrovsky has broken all records for "dialectical" quibbling. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   5)&nbsp;I shall not touch on the remaining questions, for I think they have been exhaustively dealt with in the correspondence with Yan-sky.
