    Comrade Lenin, 
<A NAME="p50">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    During the last three days I have had the opportunity to read the symposium: <I>A Plan for the Electrification of Russia.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LL21.html#en8">8</A>]</FONT> My illness made this possible (it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good!). An excellent, well-compiled book. A masterly draft of a really single and really state economic plan, not in quotation marks. The only Marxist attempt in our time to place the Soviet superstructure of economically backward Russia on a really practical technical and production basis, the only possible one under present conditions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     You remember Trotsky's "plan" (his theses) of last year for the "economic revival" of Russia on the basis of the mass application of the labour of unskilled <I>peasant</I>-worker masses (the labour army) to the remnants of pre-war industry. How wretched, how backward, compared with the Goelro plan! A medieval handicraftsman who imagines he is an Ibsen hero called to "save" Russia by an ancient saga. . . . And of what value are the dozens of "single plans" which to our shame appear from time to time in our press -- the childish prattle of preparatory-school pupils. . . . Or again, the philistine "realism" (in fact Manilovism) of Rykov, who continues to 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 51</B></FONT><P>

"criticise" the Goelro and is immersed to his ears in routine. . . . 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In my opinion: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     1) Not a single minute more must be wasted on idle talk about the plan. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     2) A&nbsp; p r a c t i c a l&nbsp; start on the work m u s t&nbsp; b e&nbsp; m a d e&nbsp; immediately. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     3) To this start must be devoted at least one-third of our work (two-thirds will be required for "current" needs) in transporting materials and men, restoring enterprises, distributing labour forces, delivering food stuffs, organising supply bases and supply itself, and so on. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     4) Since the staff of the Goelro, for all their excellent qualities, lack a sound practical outlook (a professorial impotence can be detected in the articles), we must without fail include in the planning commission live practical men who act on the principle -- "Report the fulfilment," "Fulfil on time," etc. 
<A NAME="p51">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     5) <I>Pravda</I>, <I>Izvestia</I>, and especially <I>Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="LL21.html#en9">9</A>]</FONT> must be instructed to popularise the <I>Plan for the Electrification</I> both as a whole and as regards its concrete points dealing with individual parts, bearing in mind that there is <I>o n l y&nbsp; o n e</I>&nbsp; "single economic plan" -- the <I>Plan for the Electrification</I>, and that all other "plans" are just idle talk, empty and harmful.
