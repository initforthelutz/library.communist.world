PREFACE 
The Fourth Volume of J. V. Stalin¹s Works contains 
his writings and speeches belonging to the period immediately 
following the October Revolution, from November 
1917 to December 1920. 
The works of this period deal with the consolidation of 
the socialist state system, the policy of the Soviet Government 
on the national question, the creation and strengthening 
of the Red Army, and military strategy and tactics in 
the period of foreign armed intervention and civil war. 
Questions of Soviet state structure and of Soviet 
policy on the national question are dealt with in 
J. V. Stalin¹s speeches at the Third All-Russian Congress 
of Soviets, in the interview ³Organization of a Russian 
Federal Republic,² in the ³General Provisions of the 
Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet 
Republic,² and in ³The October Revolution and the National 
Question,² ³The Policy of the Soviet Government 
on the National Question in Russia,² and other works. 
A number of the writings (³The Ukrainian Knot,² 
³The Don and the North Caucasus,² ³Light From the 
East² and other articles) discuss the struggle of the peoples 
of the Ukraine, the Caucasus and the Baltic Region against 
foreign invasion and for the establishment of Soviet power. 
Analyses of the situation on the civil war fronts are 
contained in the ³Report to Comrade Lenin by the Commission 
of the Party Central Committee and the Council of

PREFACE XVIII

Against Russia,² in surveys of the military situation 
on the Tsaritsyn, Petrograd and South-Western fronts, 
and in a number of letters and telegrams to V. I. Lenin. 
The struggle and victory of the Soviet people in the 
civil war are summed up in ³The Political Situation of the 
Republic² and ³Three Years of Proletarian Dictatorship.² 
Included in this volume are the article ³Lenin as the 
Organizer and Leader of the Russian Communist Party² 
and the speech at the meeting called by the Moscow Committee 
of the R.C.P.(B.) on the occasion of Lenin¹s fiftieth 
birthday, which paint a portrait of the great leader.

SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE CONGRESS 
OF THE FINNISH SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC 
LABOUR PARTY, HELSINGFORS 
November 14, 1917 
Comrades, I have been delegated to greet you on 
behalf of the workers¹ revolution in Russia, which is 
shaking the capitalist system to its foundations. I have 
come to you to greet your Congress on behalf of the Workers¹ 
and Peasants¹ Government of Russia, the Council of 
People¹s Commissars, which was born in the fire of this 
revolution. 
But I have not only come to bring you greetings. I 
should like first of all to bring you the joyful news of 
the victories of the Russian revolution, of the disorganization 
of its enemies, and to tell you that in the atmosphere 
of the expiring imperialist war the chances of the 
revolution are improving day by day. 
The bondage of landlordism has been broken, for 
power in the countryside has passed into the hands of 
the peasants. The power of the generals has been broken, 
for power in the army i s now concentrated in the 
hands of the soldiers. A curb has been put on the capitalists, 
for workers¹ control is rapidly being established over the 
factories, mills and banks. The whole country, town and 
countryside, rear and front, is studded with revolutionary 
committees of workers, soldiers and peasants, which are 
taking the reins of government into their own hands.

J. V. S T A L I N 2 
They tried to scare us with the bogey of Kerensky and 
the counter-revolutionary generals. But Kerensky has been 
driven out, and the generals are besieged by the soldiers 
and Cossacks, who also support the demands of the 
workers and peasants. 
They tried to scare us with the bogey of famine, 
and prophesied that the Soviet regime would perish in 
the grip of a disrupted food supply. But we had only to 
curb the profiteers, we had only to appeal to the peasants, 
and grain began to flow to the towns in hundreds 
of thousands of poods. 
They tried to scare us with the bogey of a breakdown 
of the machinery of state, sabotage by officials, 
and so on. And we knew ourselves that the new, socialist 
government would not be able simply to take over 
the old, bourgeois state machine and make it its own. 
But we had only to set about renovating the old machine, 
purging it of anti-social elements, and the sabotage began 
to melt away. 
They tried to scare us with the bogey of war ³surprises,² 
the possibility of the imperialist cliques creating 
complications in connection with our proposal for a democratic 
peace. And, indeed, there was a danger, a mortal 
danger. But that danger arose after the capture of 
Ösel,1 when the Kerensky Government was preparing to 
flee to Moscow and surrender Petrograd, and when the 
British and German imperialists were making a deal for 
peace at the expense of Russia. On the basis of such a peace 
the imperialists could indeed have wrecked the cause of 
the Russian and, perhaps, of the international revolution. 
But the October Revolution came in time. It took the 
cause of peace into its own hands, it struck the most

SPEECH DELIVERED AT CONGRESS OF FINNISH S.D.L.P. 3 
dangerous weapon from the hands of international imperialism 
and thus saved the revolution from mortal 
peril. The old wolves of imperialism were left with one of 
two alternatives: either to bow to the revolutionary movement 
that is flaring up in all countries, by accepting 
peace, or to carry on the struggle by continuing the war. 
But to continue the war in its fourth year, when the 
whole world is suffocating in its grip, when the ³imminent² 
winter campaign is arousing a storm of indignation 
among the soldiers of all countries, and when the filthy 
secret treaties have already been published‹to continue 
the war under such circumstances means to doom oneself 
to obvious failure. This time the old wolves of imperialism 
have miscalculated. And that is why the bogey of imperialist 
³surprises² does not scare us. 
Lastly, they tried to scare us with the bogey of the 
disintegration of Russia, of its splitting up into numerous 
independent states and hinted thereby that the 
right of nations to self-determination proclaimed by the 
Council of People¹s Commissars was a ³fatal mistake.² 
But I must declare most categorically that we would not 
be democrats (I say nothing of socialism!) if we did not 
recognize the right of the peoples of Russia to free 
self-determination. I declare that we would be betraying 
socialism if we did not do everything to restore-fraternal 
confidence between the workers of Finland and 
Russia. But everyone knows that the restoration of this 
confidence is inconceivable unless the right of the Finnish 
people to free self-determination is firmly recognized. And 
it is not merely the verbal, even if official, recognition of 
this right that is important here. What is important is 
that this verbal recognition will be confirmed by the act of

J. V. S T A L I N 4
the Council of People¹s Commissars, that it will be put 
into effect without hesitation. For the time for words has 
passed. The time has come when the old slogan ³Workers 
of all countries, unite!² must be put into effect. 
Complete freedom for the Finnish people, and for the 
other peoples of Russia, to arrange their own life! A voluntary 
and honest alliance of the Finnish people with the 
Russian people! No tutelage, no supervision from above, 
over the Finnish people! These are the guiding principles 
of the policy of the Council of People¹s Commissars. 
Only as the result of such a policy can mutual confidence 
among the peoples of Russia be created. Only on the basis 
of such confidence can the peoples of Russia be united 
in one army. Only by thus uniting the peoples can the 
gains of the October Revolution be consolidated and 
the cause of the international socialist revolution advanced. 
That is why we smile when we are told that Russia 
will inevitably fall to pieces if the idea of the right of 
nations to self-determination is put into practice. 
These are the difficulties with which our enemies 
have tried and are still trying to scare us, but which we 
are overcoming as the revolution grows. 
Comrades! Information has reached us that your 
country is experiencing approximately the same crisis 
of power as Russia experienced on the eve of the October 
Revolution. Information has reached us that attempts 
are being made to frighten you too with the bogey of 
famine, sabotage, and so on. Permit me to tell you 
on the basis of the practical experience of the revolutionary 
movement in Russia that these dangers, even 
if real, are by no means insuperable! These dangers

SPEECH DELIVERED AT CONGRESS OF FINNISH S.D.L.P. 5 
can be overcome if you act resolutely and without 
faltering. In the midst of war and economic disruption, 
in the midst of the revolutionary movement which is 
flaring up in the West and of the increasing victories of 
the workers¹ revolution in Russia, there are no dangers or 
difficulties that could withstand your onslaught. In such 
a situation only one power, socialist power, can maintain 
itself and conquer. In such a situation only one 
kind of tactics can be effective, the tactics of Danton‹ 
audacity, audacity and again audacity! 
And if you should need our help, you will have it‹ 
we shall extend you a fraternal hand. 
Of this you may rest assured.

REPLY TO UKRAINIAN COMRADES 
IN THE REAR AND AT THE FRONT 
Since our relations with the Ukrainian Rada2 became 
strained I have been receiving numerous resolutions 
and letters from Ukrainian comrades on the subject 
of the conflict with the Rada. I consider it impossible and 
superfluous to answer each resolution and each letter 
separately, since the same things are repeated in almost 
all of them. I have therefore decided to single out the questions 
most frequently to be found in them and to reply with 
a clarity that will leave no room for doubt. These questions 
are generally known: 
1) How did the conflict arise? 
2) Over what issues did the conflict arise? 
3) What measures are needed for a peaceful settlement 
of the conflict? 
4) Can it really be that the fraternal peoples will 
shed each other¹s blood? 
That is followed by a general assurance that the 
conflict between the two kindred peoples will be settled 
peacefully, without fratricidal bloodshed. 
First of all, it should be observed that the Ukrainian 
comrades are labouring under a certain confusion of 
ideas. They sometimes represent the conflict with the 
Rada as a conflict between the Ukrainian and Russian

REPLY TO UKRAINIAN COMRADES 7 
peoples. But that is not true. There is no conflict and 
there can be no conflict between the Ukrainian and 
Russian peoples. The Ukrainian and Russian peoples, 
like the other peoples of Russia, consist of workers and 
peasants, of soldiers and sailors. Together, they all fought 
against tsarism and Kerenskyism, against the landlords and 
capitalists, against war and imperialism. Together, they all 
shed their blood for land and peace, for liberty and socialism. 
In the struggle against the landlords and capitalists 
they are all brothers and comrades. In the struggle for 
their vital interests there is no conflict and there can be 
no conflict between them. The enemies of the working 
people find it advantageous, of course, to represent the 
conflict with the Rada as a conflict between the Russian 
and Ukrainian peoples, because that makes it easier for 
them to incite the workers and peasants of the kindred 
peoples against one another, to the glee of the oppressors 
of the peoples. But is it so difficult for the enlightened 
workers and peasants to understand that what is 
advantageous to the oppressors of the peoples is harmful 
for the peoples themselves? 
It was not between the peoples of Russia and the 
Ukraine that the conflict arose, but between the Council 
of People¹s Commissars and the General Secretariat of 
the Rada. 
Over what questions did the conflict arise? 
It is said that the conflict arose over the question 
of centralism or self-determination, that the Council 
of People¹s Commissars does not allow the Ukrainian 
people to take power into their own hands and to 
decide their destiny freely. Is this true? No, it is not. 
The Council of People¹s Commissars is, in fact, striving

J. V. S T A L I N 8
to have all power in the Ukraine belong to the Ukrainian 
people, that is, to the Ukrainian workers and soldiers, 
peasants and sailors. Soviet power, that is, the power of 
the workers and peasants, the soldiers and sailors, without 
landlords or capitalists, is precisely that people¹s power 
for which the Council of People¹s Commissars is fighting. 
The General Secretariat does not want such a power, 
because it does not desire to get rid of the landlords 
and capitalists. That, and not centralism, is the crux 
of the matter. 
The Council of People¹s Commissars stands, and has 
stood from the very first, for free self-determination. 
It would not even object if the Ukrainian people were 
to secede and form an independent state. It has declared 
this officially on several occasions. But when 
self-determination of the people is identified with the 
autocratic rule of Kaledin, when the General Secretariat 
of the Rada attempts to represent the counterrevolutionary 
revolts of Cossack generals as a manifestation 
of the self-determination of the people, the Council 
of People¹s Commissars cannot refrain from observing 
that the General Secretariat is making a pretence of selfdetermination, 
and is using this pretence to conceal its 
alliance with Kaledin and Rodzyanko. We stand for 
the self-determination of peoples, but we are opposed 
to self-determination being used as a camouflage for 
the surreptitious establishment of the autocratic rule of 
Kaledin, who only yesterday was campaigning for the 
strangulation of Finland. 
It is said that the conflict arose over the question of 
the Ukrainian Republic, that the Council of People¹s 
Commissars does not recognize the Ukrainian Republic.

REPLY TO UKRAINIAN COMRADES 9 
Is this true? No, it is not. The Council of People¹s 
Commissars officially recognized the Ukrainian Republic 
in the ³Ultimatum² and in the ³Reply² to the Petrograd 
Ukrainian Staff.3 It is prepared to recognize a republic 
in any of the national regions of Russia should 
the working population of the given region desire it. 
It is prepared to recognize a federal structure for our 
country, should the working population of the regions 
of Russia desire it. But when a people¹s republic is identified 
with the military dictatorship of Kaledin, when the 
General Secretariat of the Rada endeavours to represent 
the monarchists Kaledin and Rodzyanko as pillars of 
the republic, the Council of People¹s Commissars cannot 
refrain from pointing out that the General Secretariat 
is making a pretence of a republic, and is using this pretence 
to conceal its complete dependence on monarchist 
plutocrats. We stand for a Ukrainian Republic, but we 
are opposed to the republic being used as a camouflage 
for sworn enemies of the people, the monarchists Kaledin 
and Rodzyanko, who only yesterday were campaigning 
for the restoration of the old regime and the death penalty 
for the soldiers. 
No, the questions of centralism and self-determination 
have no bearing on the conflict with the Rada. It was not 
over these questions that the dispute arose. Centralism and 
self-determination have been dragged in by the General 
Secretariat artificially, as a strategical ruse designed to 
conceal from the Ukrainian masses the real reasons for 
the conflict. 
It was not over the question of centralism or selfdetermination 
that the conflict arose, but over the three 
following concrete questions:

J. V. S T A L I N 10 
First question. The conflict started with the orders 
issued to the front by member of the General Secretariat 
Petlura, orders which threatened to result in the 
complete disorganization of the front. Disregarding General 
Headquarters and the interests of the front, disregarding 
the peace negotiations and the cause of peace 
generally, Petlura began to issue orders for the return 
of all Ukrainian army and navy units to the Ukraine. 
It will be easily realized that if the Ukrainian 
units had obeyed Petlura¹s orders the front would have 
disintegrated instantaneously: the Ukrainian units in 
the North would have moved southward, the non-Ukrainian 
units in the South would have moved northward, 
the other nationalities would also have ³hit the home 
trail,² the railways would have been occupied exclusively 
with the transport of soldiers and equipment, food 
would have ceased to arrive at the front because there 
would have been no means of transporting it‹and of the 
front nothing but a memory would have remained. This 
would have altogether wrecked the chances of an armistice 
and peace. No one denies that in ordinary times 
the place of the Ukrainian soldier is primarily at home, 
in the Ukraine. No one denies that ³nationalization² 
of the army is an acceptable and desirable thing. This 
has been officially stated several times by the Council 
of People¹s Commissars. But in time of war, when peace 
has not yet been arranged, and the front is not constructed 
on national lines, and when, owing to the weakness 
of our transport system, immediate ³nationalization² of 
the army would be fraught with the danger of the soldiers 
leaving their positions and of the front disintegrating, 
thus wrecking the chances of a peace and armistice‹

REPLY TO UKRAINIAN COMRADES 11 
it need not be said that, in these conditions, there could 
be no question of the national units leaving their positions 
immediately. I do not know whether Petlura was 
aware that by his senseless orders he was breaking up 
the front and wrecking the cause of peace. But the 
Ukrainian soldiers and sailors realized it at once, because 
all of them, with rare exceptions, refused to obey Petlura 
and decided to remain at their posts until peace was 
concluded. The Ukrainian soldiers have thereby saved 
the cause of peace, and Petlura¹s ill-considered orders 
have for the time being lost their extreme gravity. 
Second question. The conflict started by Petlura¹s orders 
was aggravated by the policy of the General Secretariat 
of the Rada when it began to disarm the-Ukrainian- Soviets 
of Deputies. In Kiev, armed detachments of the General 
Secretariat fell upon the Soviet troops at night and 
disarmed them. Similar attempts were made in Odessa 
and Kharkov, but there they failed because they encountered 
resistance. But we have reliable information to the 
effect that the General Secretariat is massing forces 
against Odessa and Kharkov with the object of disarming 
the Soviet troops. We have reliable information to 
the effect that in a number of other, smaller, towns the 
Soviet troops have already been disarmed and ³sent home.² 
The General Secretariat of the Rada has thus made it 
its object to carry out Kornilov¹s and Kaledin¹s, Alexeyev¹s 
and Rodzyanko¹s programme of disarming the Soviets. 
But the Soviets are the bulwark and hope of the revolution. 
Whoever disarms the Soviets disarms the revolution, 
wrecks the cause of peace and liberty, betrays the 
cause of the workers and peasants. It was the Soviets that 
saved Russia from the yoke of Kornilovism. It was the

J. V. S T A L I N 12 
Soviets that saved Russia from the shame of Kerenskyism. 
It was the Soviets that won land and an armistice 
for the peoples of Russia. The Soviets, and the Soviets 
alone, are capable of leading the people¹s revolution 
to complete victory. Therefore, whoever raises his hand 
against the Soviets helps the landlords and capitalists 
to strangle the workers and peasants of all Russia, helps 
the Kaledins and Alexeyevs to strengthen their ³iron² 
rule over the soldiers and Cossacks. 
Let no one try to tell us that the General Secretariat 
contains Socialists, and that they therefore cannot betray 
the cause of the people. Kerensky calls himself a 
Socialist, nevertheless he sent troops against revolutionary 
Petrograd. Gotz calls himself a Socialist, nevertheless 
he raised the military cadets and officers against 
the Petrograd soldiers and sailors. Savinkov and Avksentyev 
call themselves Socialists, nevertheless they introduced 
the death penalty for the soldiers at the front. 
Socialists should be judged not by their words, but by 
their deeds. The General Secretariat is disrupting and 
disarming the Ukrainian Soviets, thereby helping Kaledin 
to establish his bloody regime on the Don and in 
the coal basin‹and that is a fact that no socialist 
flag can conceal. That is why the Council of People¹s 
Commissars affirms that the General Secretariat¹s 
policy is a counter-revolutionary policy. That is why 
the Council of People¹s Commissars hopes that the 
Ukrainian workers and soldiers, who in Russia were in 
the van of the fight for revolutionary Soviet power, will 
be able to call their General Secretariat to order, or elect 
another in its place in the interest of peace among 
nations.

REPLY TO UKRAINIAN COMRADES 13 
It is said that there must be an ³exchange² of military 
units between the Ukraine and Russia, demarcation 
and the like. The Council of People¹s Commissars fully 
recognizes the necessity for demarcation. But demarcation 
must be effected in fraternal, friendly fashion, by 
agreement, and not forcibly, not on the ³principle² of 
³grab what you can,² ³disarm whomsoever you can,² as the 
General Secretariat is now doing, seizing food supplies, 
appropriating freights, and condemning the army to 
starve and freeze. 
Third question. The conflict reached a climax when 
the General Secretariat categorically refused to permit 
the passage of the revolutionary troops of the Soviets 
proceeding against Kaledin. Armed detachments of the General 
Secretariat hold up trains carrying revolutionary 
troops, dismantle tracks, threaten to open fire, and declare 
that they cannot permit the transit of ³alien² 
troops through their territory. It is Russian soldiers, 
who only yesterday were fighting shoulder to shoulder 
with the Ukrainians against the hangmen-generals who 
were trying to crush the Ukraine, that now, it appears, 
are ³aliens²! And this at a time when this same General 
Secretariat freely permits the transit to Rostov through 
its territory of Kaledin¹s Cossack units and counter-revolutionary 
officers who are flocking to Kaledin from all 
parts! 
Kornilovites and Kaledinites are putting Rostov Red 
Guards to the sword, yet the General Secretariat of the 
Rada is preventing the sending of aid to our Rostov comrades! 
Kaledin¹s officers are shooting our comrades in the 
mines, yet the General Secretariat is preventing us from 
extending assistance to our comrades the miners! Is it

J. V. S T A L I N 14 
any wonder that Kaledin, who yesterday was smashed, 
i s today advancing further and further northward, 
seizing the Donets Basin and threatening Tsaritsyn? 
Is it not obvious that the General Secretariat is in 
alliance with Kaledin and Rodzyanko? Is it not obvious 
that the General Secretariat prefers an alliance with the 
Kornilovites to an alliance with the Council of People¹s 
Commissars? 
It is said that there must be agreement between the 
Council of People¹s Commissars and the General Secretariat 
of the Rada. But is it difficult to understand that agreement 
with the present General Secretariat would be agreement 
with Kaledin and Rodzyanko? Is it difficult to understand 
that the Council of People¹s Commissars cannot 
agree to commit suicide? We did not begin the revolution 
against the landlords and capitalists in order to 
end it with an alliance with hangmen like Kaledin. The 
workers and soldiers did not shed their blood in order 
to surrender to the mercy of the Alexeyevs and Rodzyankos. 
One thing or the other: 
Either the Rada breaks with Kaledin, extends a hand 
to the Soviets and allows free passage to the revolutionary 
troops proceeding against the counter-revolutionary 
hotbed on the Don‹and then the workers and soldiers 
of the Ukraine and Russia will cement their revolutionary 
alliance with a new surge of fraternization; 
Or the Rada refuses to break with Kaledin and allow 
passage to the revolutionary troops‹and then the General 
Secretariat of the Rada will achieve what the enemies of 
the people tried in vain to achieve, namely, fratricidal 
bloodshed of the peoples.

REPLY TO UKRAINIAN COMRADES 15 
It depends upon the enlightenment and revolutionary 
consciousness of the Ukrainian workers and soldiers 
to call their General Secretariat to order or to elect another 
in its place in the interest of a peaceful settlement 
of the dangerous conflict. 
It depends upon the staunchness and determination 
of the Ukrainian workers and soldiers to compel the General 
Secretariat to declare definitely which alliance it 
now favours: an alliance with Kaledin and Rodzyanko 
against the revolution, or an alliance with the Council 
of People¹s Commissars against the counter-revolution 
of the Cadets and generals. 
It is upon the people of the Ukraine that a peaceful 
settlement of the conflict depends.

THE UKRAINIAN RADA 
Speech Delivered in the All-Russian 
Central Executive Committee 
December 14, 1917 
It may seem strange that the Council of People¹s 
Commissars, which has always resolutely upheld the 
principle of self-determination, should have entered into 
a conflict with the Rada, which also takes its stand on 
the principle of self-determination. To understand the 
origin of the conflict, it is necessary to examine the political 
complexion of the Rada. 
The Rada starts out from the principle of a division 
of power between the bourgeoisie, on the one hand, 
and the proletariat and peasantry, on the other. The 
Soviets reject such a division, and want the whole power 
to belong to the people, without the bourgeoisie. This 
is why the Rada sets up in opposition to the slogan, 
³All power to the Soviets² (i.e., the people) its own 
slogan, ³All power to the urban and rural local government 
bodies² (i.e., the people and the bourgeoisie). 
It is said that the conflict arose over the question of 
self-determination. But that is not true. The Rada proposes 
the establishment of a federal system in Russia. 
The Council of People¹s Commissars, however, goes 
farther than the Rada and recognizes the right to secession. 
Consequently, the divergence between the Council 
of People¹s Commissars and the Rada is not over that

THE UKRAINIAN RADA 17 
question. Absolutely incorrect likewise is the Rada¹s assertion 
that centralism is the point of difference. Regional 
centres formed on the model of the Council of People¹s 
Commissars (Siberia, Byelorussia, Turkestan) applied to 
the Council of People¹s Commissars for directives. The 
Council of People¹s Commissars replied: you yourselves 
are the authority in your localities, and you yourselves 
therefore must draw up the directives. That, then, is 
not the point at issue. Actually, the divergence between 
the Council of People¹s Commissars and the Rada arose 
over the following three points. 
First question: concentration of the Ukrainian units 
on the Southern Front. Unquestionably, national armies 
are the best fitted to protect their own territories. 
But at present our front is not built on national lines. 
In view of the dislocation of transport, reconstruction of 
the front on national lines would result in its complete 
disruption. This would wreck the chances of peace. The 
Ukrainian soldiers proved to have more sense and honesty 
than the General Secretariat, for the majority of the 
Ukrainian units refused to obey the Rada¹s orders. 
Second question: disarmament of the Soviet troops in 
the Ukraine. By upholding the interests of the Ukrainian 
landlords and bourgeoisie and disarming the Soviet troops, 
the Ukrainian Rada is striking a blow at the revolution. 
Substantially, the actions of the Rada in this respect in 
no way differ from the actions of Kornilov and Kaledin. 
Needless to say, the Council of People¹s Commissars will 
oppose this counter-revolutionary policy of the Rada 
might and main. 
Lastly, the third question: refusal to permit the passage 
of Soviet troops proceeding against Kaledin, around

J. V. S T A L I N 18 
whom all the counter-revolutionary forces of Russia 
have rallied. The Rada justified its refusal to permit the 
passage of the Soviet troops on the grounds of its ³neutrality² 
vis-à-vis the ³self-determining² Kaledin. But the 
Rada substitutes the autocratic rule of Kaledin for 
the self-determination of the labouring Cossacks. 
By obstructing the passage of the Soviet troops, the 
Rada is assisting Kaledin¹s advance northward. At 
the same time the Rada freely permits the transit of 
Kaledin Cossack units to the Don. At a time when 
our comrades are being shot down in Rostov and the 
Donets Basin, the Rada is preventing us from sending 
them aid. Needless to say, this treacherous conduct of 
the Rada cannot be tolerated. 
The Council of People¹s Commissars cannot give up 
the fight against Kaledin. Kaledin¹s counter-revolutionary 
nest must be destroyed. That is inevitable. 
If the Rada obstructs our advance against Kaledin 
and tries to act as a shield for him, the blows aimed 
at Kaledin will fall upon the Rada. The Council of 
People¹s Commissars will not hesitate to wage a determined 
fight against the Rada, because it is well aware that the 
Rada is in secret alliance with Kaledin. The Council of 
People¹s Commissars has intercepted a ciphered telegram 
which makes it clear that the Rada is in direct contact 
with the French Mission, with the aim of delaying 
peace until the spring, and, through the French Mission, 
with Kaledin. This alliance is directed against 
peace and the revolution. This alliance must and will 
be smashed. 
We are reproached for conducting a resolute policy 
against the Rada. But it is precisely this resolute

THE UKRAINIAN RADA 19 
policy that has opened the eyes of the Ukrainian workers 
and peasants by revealing the bourgeois nature of the 
Rada. This is evident, for example, from the telegram 
reporting the formation in the Ukraine of a new Ukrainian 
revolutionary power4 which recognizes the Soviet 
Government and is acting against the bourgeois Rada. 
(Applause.) 
Izvestia, No. 254, 
December 17, 1917

WHAT IS THE UKRAINIAN RADA? 
The reader will find below a ciphered telegram intercepted 
by the Soviet Government which exposes the real 
nature of the Rada and the real designs of the Military 
Missions of ³our Allies² in the matter of peace. It will 
be seen from the telegram that something in the nature 
of an alliance has already been arranged between the 
French Mission and the Rada, and that ³officials of 
the French Mission are working in direct contact with the 
Rada.² It will be seen from the telegram, further, that 
the purpose of this alliance is to ³maintain the semblance 
of a Russian front until February or March and delay 
the definite conclusion of an armistice until the spring.² 
It will be seen from the telegram, lastly, that the French 
Mission has entered into ³an agreement with the Cossack 
Assembly² (i.e., the Kaledin ³government²) with the 
object of ³supplying coal and food to the Rumanian 
and South-Western fronts² (which according to plan are 
to be taken over by the Rada‹J. St.). 
In short, there exists, it appears, an alliance of the 
Rada, Kaledin and the French Military Mission with 
the purpose of torpedoing peace, of ³delaying² it ³until 
the spring.² Furthermore the French Military Mission 
is not acting independently, but on ³the urgent instructions 
of the French Government.²

WHAT IS THE UKRAINIAN RADA? 21 
We have no desire to dwell here on the conduct of 
the Military Missions of ³our Allies.² Their role has 
been sufficiently elucidated: in August they helped Kornilov, 
in November they helped the Rada and Kaledin, 
in December they are supplying the rebels with armoured 
cars. And all this for the sake of ³a war to a finish.² 
We do not doubt that the coercive undertaking of the 
³Allies² will be thwarted by the struggle of the peoples of 
Russia for a democratic peace. The missions are behaving 
as if they were in Central Africa. But the ³Allies² will soon 
have cause to learn that Russia is not Central Africa. . . . 
What chiefly interests us here is the ugly role assumed 
by the Rada. 
Now we know why the Rada is concentrating the 
Ukrainian units on the Rumanian-South-Western Front: 
³nationalization² of the army is a camouflage with which 
it is trying to conceal its compact with the French Mission 
to delay an armistice until the spring. 
Now we know why the Rada is not permitting the 
passage of Soviet troops proceeding against Kaledin: 
³neutrality² vis-à-vis Kaledin is a camouflage with 
which it is trying to conceal its alliance with Kaledin 
against the Soviets. 
Now we know why the Rada protests against the ³interference² 
of the Council of People¹s Commissars in 
Ukrainian internal affairs: talk of non-interference is 
only a camouflage with which it is trying to conceal the 
actual interference of the French Government in the 
affairs of the Ukraine and of all Russia, with the aim 
of liquidating the gains-of the revolution. 
Ukrainian comrades frequently ask me. What is the 
Rada?

J. V. S T A L I N 22 
I reply: 
The Rada, or rather its General Secretariat, is a 
government of traitors to socialism who call themselves 
Socialists in order to deceive the masses‹just like the 
Government of Kerensky and Savinkov, who also called 
themselves Socialists. 
The Rada, or rather its General Secretariat, is a 
bourgeois government which, in alliance with Kaledin, 
is fighting the Soviets. Formerly, the Kerensky Government, 
in alliance with Kornilov, disarmed the Soviets 
of Russia. Now the Rada Government, in alliance with 
Kaledin, is disarming the Soviets of the Ukraine. 
The Rada, or rather its General Secretariat, is a 
bourgeois government which, in alliance with the British 
and French capitalists, is fighting to prevent peace. 
Formerly, the Kerensky Government delayed peace and 
condemned millions of soldiers to serve as cannon fodder. 
Now the Rada Government is endeavouring to prevent 
peace by ³delaying an armistice until the spring.² 
For this, the Kerensky Government was overthrown 
by the joint efforts of the workers and soldiers of Russia. 
We do not doubt that the Rada Government will 
likewise be overthrown by the efforts of the workers and 
soldiers of the Ukraine. 
Only a new Rada, a Rada of the Soviets of the workers, 
soldiers and peasants of the Ukraine, can protect 
the interests of the Ukrainian people from the Kaledins 
and Kornilovs, the landlords and capitalists.

THE INDEPENDENCE OF FINLAND 
Speech Delivered in the All-Russian 
Central Executive Committee 
December 22, 1917 
(Newspaper Report) 
The other day representatives of Finland applied to 
us with a demand for immediate recognition of Finland¹s 
complete independence and endorsement of its secession 
from Russia. The Council of People¹s Commissars resolved 
to give its consent and to issue a decree, which 
has already been published in the newspapers, proclaiming 
Finland¹s complete independence. 
Here is the text of the decision of the Council of 
People¹s Commissars: 
³In response to the application of the Finnish Government 
for recognition of the independence of the Finnish 
Republic, the Council of People¹s Commissars, 
in full conformity with the principle of the right of 
nations to self-determination, resolves to recommend 
to the Central Executive Committee: a) to recognize 
the state independence of the Finnish Republic, and 
b) to set up, in agreement with the Finnish Government, 
a special commission (composed of representatives of 
both sides) to elaborate the practical measures necessitated 
by the secession of Finland from Russia.² 
Naturally, the Council of People¹s Commissars 
could not act otherwise, for if a nation, through its representatives, 
demands recognition of its independence, a

J. V. S T A L I N 24 
proletarian government, acting on the principle of 
granting the peoples the right to self-determination, must 
give its consent. 
The bourgeois press asserts that we have brought 
about the complete disintegration of the country, that 
we have lost a whole number of countries, including 
Finland. But, comrades, we could not lose Finland, 
because actually it was never our property. If we forcibly 
retained Finland, that would not mean that we had 
acquired it. 
We know perfectly well how Wilhelm forcibly and 
arbitrarily ³acquires² entire states and what sort of a 
basis this creates for mutual relations between the peoples 
and their oppressors. 
The principles of Social-Democracy, its slogans and 
aspirations, consist in creating the long-awaited atmosphere 
of mutual confidence among nations, and only 
on such a basis is the slogan, ³Workers of all countries, 
unite!² realizable. All this is old and well known. 
If we closely examine the circumstances in which 
Finland obtained independence, we shall see that the 
Council of People¹s Commissars, actually and against 
its own wishes, granted freedom not to the people, not 
to the representatives of the Finnish proletariat, but to 
the Finnish bourgeoisie, which, owing to a strange conjuncture 
of circumstances, seized power and received 
independence from the hands of the Russian Socialists. 
The Finnish workers and Social-Democrats find themselves 
in the position of having to receive freedom not 
from the Socialists of Russia directly, but through the 
Finnish bourgeoisie. Regarding this as a tragedy for the 
Finnish proletariat, we cannot help remarking that

THE INDEPENDENCE OF FINLAND 25 
it was only because of their irresolution and unaccountable 
cowardice that the Finnish Social-Democrats did 
not take vigorous measures to assume power themselves 
and wrest their independence from the hands of the 
Finnish bourgeoisie. 
The Council of People¹s Commissars may be abused, 
may be criticized, but no one can assert that it does not 
carry out its promises; for there is no force on earth 
that can compel the Council of People¹s Commissars to 
break its promises. This we have demonstrated by the 
absolute impartiality with which we accepted the demand 
of the Finnish bourgeoisie that Finland be granted independence, 
and by proceeding at once to issue a decree 
proclaiming the independence of Finland. 
May the independence of Finland help the emancipation 
of the Finnish workers and peasants and create 
a firm basis for friendship between our peoples.

So-called ³Turkish Armenia² is the only country, I 
believe, that Russia occupied ³by right of war.² This

exercises of the East. Pogroms and massacres of Armenians,

the diplomats of all countries as a screen for fresh massacres, 
on the other, and a blood-soaked, deceived 
and enslaved Armenia as a result‹who is not familiar 
with these ³commonplace² pictures of the diplomatic 
³handiwork² of the ³civilized² Powers? 
The sons of Armenia‹heroic defenders of their country, 
but by no means far-sighted politicians, who have 
allowed themselves time and again to be deceived by 
the sharks of imperialist diplomacy‹cannot fail to see 
now that the old path of diplomatic scheming is not 
the path to the liberation of Armenia. It is becoming 
clear that the path of liberation for the oppressed peoples 
lies through the workers¹ revolution that was started 
in Russia in October. It is now clear to all that the fate 
of the peoples of Russia, and particularly of the Armenian 
people, is closely bound up with the fate of the

³TURKISH ARMENIA² 27 
October Revolution. The October Revolution has broken 
the chains of national oppression. It has torn up the 
tsarist secret treaties, which tied the peoples hand and 
foot. It, and it alone, can complete the emancipation 
of the peoples of Russia. 
Acting on these considerations, the Council of People¹s 
Commissars has decided to issue a special decree 
on the free self-determination of ³Turkish Armenia.² 
This is particularly necessary today, when the German 
and Turkish authorities, true to their imperialist nature, 
make no secret of their desire forcibly to retain the 
occupied regions under their sway. Let the peoples of 
Russia know that the striving for conquest is alien to 
the Russian revolution and its government. Let everyone 
know that the Council of People¹s Commissars counters 
the imperialist policy of national oppression by the 
policy of complete liberation of the oppressed peoples.

SPEECH AT THE MEETING OF THE CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE OF THE R.S.D.L.P.(B.) ON THE 
QUESTION OF PEACE WITH THE GERMANS 
January 11, 1918 
(Summary Record in the Minutes) 
Comrade Stalin considers that if we accept the slogan 
of a revolutionary war we shall be playing into the 
hands of imperialism. Trotsky¹s position cannot be called 
a position at all. There is no revolutionary movement 
in the West, there is no evidence of a revolutionary 
movement. It exists only in potential, and in our practical 
activities we cannot rely merely on potentials. 
If the Germans begin to advance, it will strengthen the 
hand of counter-revolution here at home. Germany can 
advance, because she has her own Kornilov troops‹her 
³Guards.² In October, we talked of a sacred war against 
imperialism because we were told that the mere word 
³peace² would be enough to start a revolution in the 
West. But that has not proved correct. Our socialist 
reforms are stirring up the West, but we need time to 
carry them out. If we accept Trotsky¹s policy we shall 
create the worst possible conditions for a revolutionary 
movement in the West. Comrade Stalin therefore recommends 
the adoption of Comrade Lenin¹s proposal for 
the conclusion of peace with the Germans.

THE KIEV BOURGEOIS RADA 
The bourgeois newspapers are assiduously spreading 
rumours that ³negotiations have started between the 
Rada and the Council of People¹s Commissars.² Circles 
closely connected with the counter-revolutionaries are 
zealously spreading these rumours and stressing their 
³special² importance. Things have gone so far that 
many of our comrades are disposed to believe the 
tale about negotiations with the Kiev Rada, and many 
have already written to me inquiring whether i t is 
authentic. 
I publicly declare: 
1) The Council of People¹s Commissars is not conducting 
and has no intention of conducting any negotiations 
with the Kiev Rada. 
2) The Kiev Rada has definitely linked itself with 
Kaledin and is conducting treasonable negotiations with 
the Austro-German imperialists behind the back of the 
peoples of Russia‹and such a Rada the Council of People¹s 
Commissars can only implacably fight until the 
Ukrainian Soviets are completely victorious.

J. V. S T A L I N 30 
3) Peace and tranquility can come to the Ukraine 
only as a result of the complete liquidation of the Kiev 
bourgeois Rada, as a result of its replacement by another, 
a socialist Rada of Soviets, the nucleus of which has already 
been formed in Kharkov.

SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE THIRD 
ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS 
OF WORKERS¹, SOLDIERS¹ 
AND PEASANTS¹ DEPUTIES 
January 10-18, 1918 5 
1. REPORT ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
January 15 
(Newspaper Report) 
One of the questions that was particularly agitating 
Russia just now, the speaker said, was the national question. 
Its importance was enhanced by the fact that the 
Great Russians did not constitute an absolute majority 
of the population of Russia and were surrounded by 
a ring of other, ³non-sovereign² peoples, the inhabitants 
of the border regions. 
The tsarist government realized the importance of the 
national question and tried to handle the affairs of 
the nationalities with a rod of iron. It carried out a policy 
of forcible Russification of the border peoples, and its 
method of action was the banning of native languages, 
pogroms and other forms of persecution. 
Kerensky¹s coalition government abolished these national 
disabilities, but, because of its class character, 
it was incapable of a full solution of the national question. 
The government of the early period of the revolution 
not only did not adopt the course of completely

J. V. S T A L I N 32 
emancipating the nations, but in many instances it did 
not hesitate to resort to repressive measures to crush 
the national movement, as was the case with the Ukraine 
and Finland. 
The Soviet Government alone publicly proclaimed 
the right of all nations to self-determination, including 
complete secession from Russia. The new government 
proved to be more radical in this respect than even the 
national groups within some of the nations. 
Nevertheless, a series of conflicts arose between the 
Council of People¹s Commissars and the border regions. 
They arose, however, not over issues of a national 
character, but over the question of power. The speaker 
cited a number of examples of how the bourgeois nationalist 
governments, hastily formed in the border regions 
and composed of representatives of the upper sections of the 
propertied classes, endeavoured, under the guise of settling 
their national problems, to carry on a definite struggle 
against the Soviet and other revolutionary organizations. 
All these conflicts between the border regions 
and the central Soviet Government were rooted in the 
question of power. And if the bourgeois elements of this 
or that region sought to lend a national colouring to 
these conflicts, it was only because it was advantageous 
to them to do so, since it was convenient for them to conceal 
behind a national cloak the fight against the power 
of the labouring masses within their region. 
As an illustration, the speaker dwelt in detail on the 
Rada, convincingly showing how the principle of selfdetermination 
was being exploited by the bourgeois 
chauvinist elements in the Ukraine in their imperialist 
class interests.

SPEECHES AT THIRD ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS 33 
All this pointed to the necessity of interpreting the 
principle of self-determination as the right to self-determination 
not of the bourgeoisie, but of the labouring 
masses of the given nation. The principle of self-determination 
should be a means in the struggle for socialism 
and should be subordinated to the principles of 
socialism. 
On the question of a federal structure of the Russian 
Republic, the speaker said that the supreme organ of 
the Soviet Federation must be the Congress of Soviets. 
In the intervals between congresses its functions should 
be vested in the Central Executive Committee. 
2. DRAFT RESOLUTION 
ON THE FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS 
OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC 
1) The Russian Socialist Soviet Republic is constituted 
on the basis of a voluntary union of the 
peoples of Russia, as a Federation of the Soviet Republics 
of these peoples. 
2) The supreme organ of power in the Federation 
is the All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers¹, 
Soldiers¹ and Peasants¹ Deputies, convened not less 
frequently than once every three months. 
3) The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers¹, 
Soldiers¹ and Peasants¹ Deputies elects an All-Russian 
Central Executive Committee. In the intervals between 
congresses the All-Russian Central Executive Committee 
is the supreme organ. 
4) The Government of the Federation, the Council of 
People¹s Commissars, is elected and replaceable in whole

TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
34 
or in part by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets or the 
All-Russian Central Executive Committee. 
5) The way in which the Soviet Republics of regions 
distinguished by a specific manner of life and 
national composition will participate in the federal government, 
as well as the demarcation of the spheres 
of activity of the federal and regional institutions of 
the Russian Republic, will be determined, immediately 
upon the formation of the regional Soviet Republics, 
by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and 
the Central Executive Committees of these republics. 
3. REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE REPORT 
ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
January 15 
(Newspaper Report) 
Comrade Stalin wound up the discussion of the 
proposed resolution on the federal institutions of the 
Russian Republic. 
He pointed out that the resolution was not intended 
as a law, but only outlined the general principles of the 
future Constitution of the Russian Federative Republic. 
So long as the struggle between the two political 
trends‹nationalist counter-revolution, on the one hand, 
and Soviet power, on the other‹had not ended, there 
could be no question of a clear-cut Constitution that 
distinctly and precisely defined every detail of the state 
structure of the Soviet Republics. 
The resolution set forth only the general principles 
of the Constitution. They would be submitted to the

SPEECHES AT THIRD ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS 35 
Central Executive Committee for detailed elaboration, 
and presented for final endorsement to the next Congress 
of Soviets. 
Replying to the reproach that the Soviet Government 
was displaying excessive severity in its fight against 
the bourgeois Rada, Comrade Stalin pointed out that 
i t was a fight against bourgeois counter-revolution 
clothed in a national-democratic garb. 
Comrade Stalin stressed that the democratic flag 
employed by various political leaders of the Rada (such 
as Vinnichenko) was by no means a guarantee of a really 
democratic policy. 
We judge the Rada not by its words, but by its 
deeds. 
In what way did the ³Socialists² of the Rada display 
their socialism? 
They professed in their Universal6 to be in favour of 
the transfer of all the land to the people, but, actually, 
in their published explanation, they restricted the transfer 
by proclaiming part of the landlords¹ land inviolable 
and not transferable to the people. 
They professed their loyalty to the Soviets, but, actually, 
they waged a desperate struggle against them, 
disarming Soviet troops, arresting Soviet officials and 
making the continued existence of the Soviets absolutely 
impossible. 
They professed their fidelity to the revolution, but, 
actually, they had proved themselves to be bitter enemies 
of the revolution. 
They professed neutrality in the struggle with the 
Don, but, actually, they were rendering direct and active 
assistance to General Kaledin, helping him to shoot down

J. V. S T A L I N 36 
Soviet troops and preventing the passage of grain to 
the North. 
All these were generally known facts, and that the 
Rada was essentially bourgeois and anti-revolutionary in 
character was beyond all doubt. 
That being so, what fight of the Soviets against democracy 
was Martov referring to here? 
The speakers of the Right, especially Martov, evidently 
praised and defended the Rada because they 
saw in its policy a reflection of their own. In the Rada, 
which represented that coalition of all classes so dear 
to Messrs. the compromisers, they saw the prototype 
of the Constituent Assembly. No doubt, on hearing the 
speeches of the representatives of the Right, the Rada 
would just as assiduously praise them. It was not for 
nothing that the proverb said: Birds of a feather flock 
together. (Laughter and applause.) 
The speaker then dwelt on the question of self-determination 
of the Caucasus, and cited exact data showing 
that the Caucasian Commissariat7 was pursuing a manifestly 
aggressive policy against the Caucasian Soviet 
organizations and the army Soviet, and at the same 
time was maintaining contact with the hero of the 
counter-revolutionary movement in the Caucasus, General 
Przhevalsky. 
From all this it followed that it was necessary to continue 
the so-called civil war, which was actually a struggle 
between the trend which was striving to establish coalition, 
compromising governments in the border regions, and the 
other trend which was striving to establish socialist power, 
the power of the Soviets of the labouring masses 
of the workers¹, soldiers¹ and peasants¹ deputies.

SPEECHES AT THIRD ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF SOVIETS 37 
That was the nature and historical import of the 
bitter conflicts which were arising between the Council 
of People¹s Commissars and the bourgeois-nationalist 
coalition governments in the border regions. The assertion 
of these governments that they were fighting to 
uphold national independence was nothing but a hypocritical 
cover for the campaign they were waging against 
the working people. (Stormy applause.) 
Replying to Martov¹s reproach that the Soviet Government 
was guilty of a contradiction in demanding proletarian 
power in the Russian border regions and contenting 
itself with a referendum in Courland, Lithuania, 
Poland, etc., as advocated by Trotsky in Brest- 
Litovsk, Comrade Stalin remarked that it would be 
utterly absurd to demand Soviet power in the Western 
regions when they had not yet even Soviets, had not yet 
had a socialist revolution. 
³If we acted on Martov¹s prescription,² the speaker 
said, ³we should have to invent Soviets where they do 
not yet exist, and what is more, where the road to them 
has not yet even been paved. To talk of self-determination 
through Soviets under such conditions is the height of 
absurdity.² 
In conclusion, the speaker dwelt again on the fundamental 
difference between the Right and Left wings 
of the democracy. Whereas the Left wing was striving 
to establish the dictatorship of the lower classes, the power 
of the majority over the minority, the Right wing 
recommended turning back to an already past stage, the 
stage of bourgeois parliamentarism. The experience of 
parliamentarism in France and America convincingly 
showed that the ostensibly democratic governments

J. V. S T A L I N 38 
resulting from universal suffrage were actually coalitions 
with finance capital which were very remote from, and 
hostile to, genuine democracy. In France, that land 
of bourgeois democracy, the members of parliament 
were elected by the whole people, but the ministers 
were supplied by the Bank of Lyons. In America the 
suffrage was universal, but it was representatives of the 
billionaire Rockefeller who were in power. 
³Is not that a fact?² the speaker asked. ³Yes, we 
have indeed buried bourgeois parliamentarism, and it 
is in vain that the Martovs are trying to drag us back 
to the martovsky* period of the revolution. (Laughter and 
applause.) We, the representatives of the workers, want 
the people not only to vote, but to govern as well. It is 
not those who vote and elect that rule, but those who 
govern.² (Stormy applause.)

TELEPHONE MESSAGE TO THE PETROGRAD 
COMMITTEE, R.S.D.L.P.(B.) 
We advise the Executive Commission of the 
Petrograd Committee and all district committees of the 
Bolshevik Party to rouse all the workers without a moment¹s 
delay and, in accordance with the decision to be 
adopted this evening by the Petrograd Soviet, to muster 
tens of thousands of workers and to set to work all the 
bourgeoisie without exception, under the control of the 
workers, for digging trenches outside Petrograd. Now, 
when the revolution is in danger, this is the only way 
in which it can be saved. The line of trenches will be 
indicated by the military. Get your weapons ready and, the 
chief thing, organize and mobilize to a man.

TELEGRAM 
TO THE PEOPLE¹S SECRETARIAT, 
UKRAINIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC8 
Five days ago General Hoffmann announced that the 
term of the armistice had expired,9 and two days later 
he started hostilities. The Council of People¹s Commissars 
intimated its willingness to resume peace negotiations, 
but no reply has yet been received. The German 
Government is evidently in no hurry to reply, its idea 
being to pillage the country to the limit and only then 
to open peace negotiations. The Germans have captured 
Dvinsk, Rovno, Minsk, Volmar and Gapsal and are advancing 
on Petrograd and Kiev. Obviously, the object 
of the campaign is not only conquest, but, chiefly, the 
suppression of the revolution and its gains. 
The Council of People¹s Commissars has decided to 
organize resistance from Petrograd and to mobilize the entire 
working population, and the bourgeoisie as well, and 
if the latter should refuse to dig trenches, to take them 
by force and compel them to do so under the control of 
the workers. 
It is the general opinion of the comrades that you, 
in Kiev, should without a moment¹s delay organize 
similar resistance from Kiev westward, muster every 
able-bodied person, set up artillery, dig trenches, force 
the bourgeoisie to do trench-digging under the control

TELEGRAM TO THE PEOPLE¹S SECRETARIAT 41 
of the workers, proclaim a state of siege and act with the 
utmost severity. The general objective is to hold Petrograd 
and Kiev and check the German bands at all costs. 
The situation is more serious than you might think. 
We have not the slightest doubt that the German bandits 
want to promenade from Petrograd to Kiev and to start 
peace talks in these capitals, and in them alone. I believe 
you have not yet annulled the treaty concluded by the 
old Rada with the Germans.10 If so, we think you should 
be in no hurry to do so. 
Once again: do not lose a single moment, set to work 
without wasting words, and demonstrate to all that the 
Soviet regime is capable of defending itself. 
All our hope is in the workers, for the so-called army 
now being demobilized has proved capable only of panic 
and flight. 
I await an immediate reply.

NOTE SENT BY DIRECT WIRE 
TO THE PEOPLE¹S SECRETARIAT, 
UKRAINIAN SOVIET REPUBLIC 
From People¹s Commissar Stalin, on behalf of the 
Council of People¹s Commissars. 
The day before yesterday, February 22, we received 
the German Government¹s peace terms. They are very 
severe, one might say ferocious, and the Germans insist 
on their acceptance within forty-eight hours. Meanwhile, 
German detachments are advancing on Revel and 
Pskov, threatening Petrograd, and our troops definitely 
fail to offer resistance. I do not know whether 
these terms are known to you. We broadcast them 
by radio. Here are the major points. 
³Clause four. Russia shall immediately conclude 
peace with the Ukrainian People¹s Republic. Russian 
troops and Red Guards shall be immediately withdrawn 
from the Ukraine and Finland.² ³Russian warships in the 
Black Sea, etc., shall be immediately withdrawn to Russian 
ports and remain there until the conclusion of general 
peace, or be disarmed.² ³Commercial navigation in 
the Black Sea and other seas shall be resumed, as was 
envisaged in the armistice agreement. Mine-sweeping operations 
shall be begun immediately.²

NOTE TO THE PEOPLE¹S SECRETARIAT 43 
³Clause three. Russian troops and Red Guards shall 
be immediately withdrawn from Livonia and Estland, 
which shall be occupied by German police until 
the state of affairs in the country guarantees public 
security and order in these parts. All inhabitants arrested 
for political reasons shall be immediately set at 
liberty.² 
³Clause five. Russia shall do all in her power to ensure 
immediately the systematic restitution to Turkey 
of her eastern Anatolian provinces, and shall recognize 
the abolition of the Turkish capitulations.² 
Then follow clauses concerning a trade agreement, 
patterned on the former Rada¹s treaty with Austria- 
Hungary, with which you are familiar. 
In general, it must be said that the terms are incredibly 
ferocious. We believe that the clause on the Ukraine 
implies not the restoration of the Vinnichenko Government, 
which in itself is of no value to the Germans, but 
the exertion of very definite pressure on us with a view 
to compelling you and us to accept the treaty of the former 
Rada with Austria-Hungary, since what the Germans 
want is not Vinnichenko, but the exchange of manufactures 
for grain and ores. 
We assess the present state of affairs arising out of 
the Germans¹ advance and the flight of our troops as 
follows: after having overthrown our own imperialists, 
we have, owing to the slowness of the revolutionary 
movement in the West, the instability of our troops, 
and the unparalleled voracity of the German imperialists, 
temporarily fallen into the clutches of foreign 
imperialism, against which we must now muster our 
forces for waging a patriotic war with the hope of an

J. V. S T A L I N 44 
unleashing of the revolutionary forces in the West, which 
in our opinion is inevitable. In order to muster our forces 
we need a certain minimum respite, and this even a ferocious 
peace could provide. We must under no circumstances 
cherish illusions. We must have the courage 
to face the facts and admit that we have temporarily 
fallen into the clutches of German imperialism. It was 
by these considerations that the All-Russian Central 
Executive Committee of the Soviets was guided when 
it decided today at three in the morning to conclude 
peace on these ferocious terms and instructed the 
Council of People¹s Commissars to send a delegation 
to Brest, which was done today. The C.E.C. decided 
that only in this way could the Soviet regime be preserved. 
Meanwhile we must prepare, and thoroughly prepare, for 
waging a sacred war against German imperialism. 
We are all of the opinion that your People¹s Secretariat 
should send its own delegation to Brest and there 
declare that if Vinnichenko¹s adventure is not supported 
by the Austrians and Germans, the People¹s Secretariat 
will not object to the basic provisions of the treaty 
concluded by the former Kiev Rada. Such a step on your 
part would, firstly, stress the ideological and political 
brotherhood of the Soviets of the South and the North, 
and, secondly, preserve the Soviet regime in the Ukraine, 
which is an immense asset to the international revolution 
as a whole. We should like you to understand us and 
agree with us concerning these cardinal issues of the 
unhappy peace. 
I await an immediate reply on two points: will you 
send delegates today to Petrograd or, more simply, 
straight to Brest for joint negotiations with the Ger

NOTE TO THE PEOPLE¹S SECRETARIAT 45 
mans?‹that is the first question. Secondly, do you share 
our view regarding the acceptability of the Vinnichenko 
treaty, but without Vinnichenko and his gang? I await 
a reply to these questions, so that I may prepare the credentials 
and arrange for your journey to Brest.

THE UKRAINIAN KNOT 
At the end of February, before the conclusion of 
the peace with Germany, the People¹s Secretariat of the 
Ukrainian Soviet Republic sent a delegation to Brest 
with a declaration that it was prepared to sign the treaty 
concluded by the former Kiev Rada with the German 
coalition. 
The notorious Hoffmann, representative of the German 
command in Brest, refused to receive the delegation 
of the People¹s Secretariat, declaring that he saw no 
necessity for peace negotiations with the latter. 
Simultaneously, German and Austro-Hungarian shock 
troops, in conjunction with Petlura-Vinnichenko Haydamak 
detachments, began the invasion of the Soviet 
Ukraine. 
Not peace, but war with the Soviet Ukraine‹that 
was the meaning of Hoffmann¹s reply. 
Under the treaty signed by the former Kiev Rada, 
the Ukraine was to release 30 million poods of grain to 
Germany by the end of April. We say nothing of the 
³free export of ores² which Germany demanded. 
The People¹s Secretariat of the Soviet Ukraine was 
undoubtedly aware of this provision of the treaty and

THE UKRAINIAN KNOT 47 
knew what it was doing when it officially consented to 
sign the Vinnichenko peace. 
Nevertheless, the German Government, represented 
by Hoffmann, declined to enter into peace negotiations 
with the People¹s Secretariat, which is recognized by all 
the Soviets of the Ukraine, urban and rural. It preferred 
an alliance with corpses, an alliance with the deposed 
and expelled Kiev Rada, to a peace treaty with the People¹s 
Secretariat, which is recognized by the Ukrainian 
people and is alone capable of providing the ³necessary 
quantity² of grain. 
This means that the object of the Austro-German invasion 
is not only the securing of grain, but, and chiefly, 
the overthrow of Soviet power in the Ukraine and the 
restoration of the old bourgeois regime. 
It means that the Germans not only want to pump 
millions of poods of grain out of the Ukraine, but are 
also trying to rob the Ukrainian workers and peasants 
of their rights by taking from them the power they have 
won at the cost of their blood and turning it over to the 
landlords and capitalists. 
The Austrian and German imperialists are bringing 
on their bayonets a new and shameful yoke which is 
not a whit better than the old, Tatar yoke. Such is the 
meaning of the invasion from the West. 
This, apparently, is realized by the Ukrainian people, 
and they are feverishly preparing to resist. Formation 
of a peasant Red Army, mobilization of a workers¹ Red 
Guard, a number of successful skirmishes with the ³civilized² 
bandits after the first outbreaks of panic, recapture 
of Bakhmach, Konotop, Nezhin and an approach 
to Kiev, mounting enthusiasm of the masses, who

J. V. S T A L I N 48 
are marching in their thousands to give battle to the 
enslavers‹that is how the people¹s Ukraine is retaliating 
to the bandit invasion. 
To counter the foreign tyranny advancing from the 
West, the Soviet Ukraine is raising a war of liberation, 
a patriotic war‹such is the meaning of the developments 
in the Ukraine. 
This means that every pood of grain and scrap of 
metal the Germans get they will have to take in battle, 
in a desperate conflict with the Ukrainian people. 
It means that the Germans will have to conquer the 
Ukraine outright before they can secure grain and put 
Petlura and Vinnichenko on the throne. 
The ³swift blow² with which the Germans reckoned 
to kill two birds with one stone (secure grain and smash 
the Soviet Ukraine) stands every chance of developing 
into a protracted war of the foreign enslavers against the 
Ukraine¹s twenty millions, whose bread and liberty they 
want to take away. 
Need it be added that the Ukrainian workers and 
peasants will not spare their energies in their heroic 
struggle against the ³civilized² bandits? 
Need it be demonstrated that the patriotic war begun 
in the Ukraine has every reason to count on the utmost 
support of all Soviet Russia? 
And what if the war in the Ukraine assumes a protracted 
character and turns in the end into a war of all 
that is upright and noble in Russia against the new 
tyranny from the West? 
And what if the German workers and soldiers come to 
realize at last in the course of this war that the rulers 
of Germany are governed not by the aim of ³defending

THE UKRAINIAN KNOT 49 
the German Fatherland,² but simply by the insatiable 
appetite of a bloated imperialist beast, and, having realized 
this, draw the appropriate practical conclusions? 
Is i t not clear from this that in the Ukraine the 
major knot of the whole existing international situation 
is now being tied‹the knot of the workers¹ 
revolution begun in Russia, on the one hand, and the 
imperialist counter-revolution advancing from the West 
on the other? 
The bloated imperialist beast meeting its doom in 
Soviet Ukraine‹will this not be the outcome of the 
exorable logic of events? . . .

A TATAR-BASHKIR SOVIET REPUBLIC 
Two months have already elapsed since the Third 
Congress of Soviets proclaimed a federal system for 
the Russian Republic, but the border regions, still 
occupied with establishing Soviet power in their areas, 
have not yet expressed themselves clearly and definitely 
on the concrete forms of federation. If we do not count 
the Ukraine, which is now being brutally ravaged by 
³civilized² bandits, and the Crimea and the Don region, 
which have already expressed themselves in favour 
of a federal tie with Russia, Tatar-Bashkiria seems 
to be the only region whose revolutionary organizations 
have definitely charted a plan of federation with Soviet 
Russia. We are referring to that clear-cut general outline 
of the organization of a Tatar-Bashkir Soviet Republic 
about which everyone is now talking and which 
was elaborated by the very influential Soviet organizations 
of the Tatars and Bashkirs. 
In compliance with the wishes of the Tatar-Bashkir 
revolutionary masses, and in accordance with the decision 
of the Third Congress of Soviets proclaiming a Russian

Bashkiria, which will be convened very shortly, to elaborate 
the concrete forms and details of the statute. 
The Central Executive Committee and the Council of 
People¹s Commissars will, we have no reason to doubt, 
endorse the results of the work of this congress.

TRANSCAUCASIAN 
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 
UNDER A SOCIALIST MASK 
Of all the border regions of the Russian Federation, 
Transcaucasia is presumably the most distinguished for 
the abundance and diversity of the nationalities it comprises. 
Georgians and Russians, Armenians and Azerbaijan 
Tatars, Turks and Lesghians, Ossetians and 
Abkhazians‹this is a far from complete picture of the 
national diversity of the seven-million population of 
Transcaucasia. 
Not one of these national groups has clearly defined 
national boundaries, they all live intermingled 
and interspersed, and not only in the towns but in 
the countryside as well. That, in fact, explains why the 
common struggle of the Transcaucasian national groups 
against the centre in Russia is so frequently obscured by 
the bitter struggle they wage among themselves. And that 
creates a very ³convenient² opportunity to camouflage 
the class struggle with national flags and tinsel. 
Another and no less characteristic feature of Transcaucasia 
is its economic backwardness. Leaving aside 
Baku, that industrial oasis of the region, where foreign 
capital provides the main impulse, Transcaucasia is an agrarian 
country with more or less developed commercial 
activity in its periphery, near the sea coast, and with

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 53 
still strongly rooted survivals of a purely feudal order in 
the centre. To this day the Tiflis, Yelizavetpol and Baku 
gubernias swarm with Tatar feudal beys and Georgian 
feudal princes, who own enormous latifundia, command 
special armed bands and are the arbiters of the 
destiny of the Tatar, Armenian and Georgian peasants. 
That, in fact, explains the bitter character of the agrarian 
³disorders² in which the discontent of the peasants 
frequently finds expression. It is here, too, that we must 
seek the reason for the weakness and uncrystallized state 
of the working class movement in Transcaucasia (not 
counting Baku), a movement which is often eclipsed by 
the agrarian ³disorders.² All this creates a favourable soil 
for a political coalition of the propertied classes and socalled 
³socialist² intellectuals, the majority of whom are 
of aristocratic origin, against the workers¹ and peasants¹ 
revolution which is now flaring up in the country. 
The February revolution did not substantially alter 
the conditions of the labouring classes of the region. 
The soldiers, the most revolutionary element in the 
rural areas, were still away at the front. And the workers, 
on the whole weak as a class, owing to the economic 
backwardness of the region, and still not developed into 
a strong, organized unit, were entranced with the political 
liberties they had secured and apparently had no 
intention of going any further. The entire power remained 
in the hands of the propertied classes. They clung to it 
tightly and bided their time, gladly leaving it to the 
Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik strategists to lull 
the workers and peasants with sage speeches about the 
bourgeois character of the Russian revolution, the unfeasibility 
of a socialist revolution, and so on.

J. V. S T A L I N 54 
The October Revolution sharply changed the situation. 
It upset all relationships at one stroke and raised the 
question of the transfer of power to the labouring 
classes. The cry, ³All power to the workers and peasants!² 
reverberated like thunder through the land and roused 
the oppressed masses. And when this cry, launched 
in the North of Russia, began to be put into effect 
there, the propertied classes of Transcaucasia clearly perceived 
that the October Revolution and Soviet power 
spelled their inevitable doom. It therefore became a 
matter of life and death for them to fight the Soviet 
power. And the ³socialist² Menshevik and Socialist 
Revolutionary intellectuals, having already tasted 
of the tree of knowledge of power, now that they 
were faced with the prospect of losing power, automatically 
found themselves in alliance with the propertied 
classes. 
Such was the origin of the anti-Soviet coalition in 
Transcaucasia. 
The Transcaucasian Commissariat, with its Tatar beys 
like Khan-Khoisky and Khasmamedov, on the one hand, 
and Georgian aristocratic intellectuals like Jordania and 
Gegechkori, on the other, is the living incarnation of 
this anti-Soviet coalition. 
For the purpose of a coalition of classes within the 
national groups, ³National Councils²‹Georgian, Tatar, 
Armenian‹have been set up. Their moving spirit is the 
Menshevik Jordania. 
For the purpose of a coalition of the propertied 
strata of all the principal Transcaucasian nationalities, a 
Transcaucasian Commissariat has been set up. Its leader 
is the Menshevik Gegechkori.

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 55 
For the purpose of uniting the ³whole population² of 
the region in the struggle against the Soviet power, a 
so-called ³Transcaucasian Diet² has been set up, consisting 
of Transcaucasian Socialist-Revolutionary, Menshevik, 
Dashnak and khanite members of the Constituent 
Assembly. Its ornament, otherwise president, is the 
Menshevik Chkheidze. 
Here you have both ³socialism² and ³national selfdetermination,² 
and in addition something more real 
than this old tinsel, namely, a real alliance of the propertied 
strata against the workers¹ and peasants¹ power. 
But tinsel cannot keep you going for long. An alliance 
demands ³action.² And ³action² was promptly 
forthcoming at the first sign of real danger. We are referring 
to the return of the revolutionary soldiers from the 
Turkish Front after the peace negotiations began. These 
soldiers had to pass through Tiflis, the capital of the anti- 
Soviet coalition. In the hands of the Bolsheviks, they 
might have constituted a serious threat to the existence 
of the Transcaucasian Commissariat. A danger of a very 
real order. And in the face of this danger all the ³socialist² 
tinsel was discarded. The counter-revolutionary character 
of the coalition became manifest. The Commissariat 
and the ³National Councils² treacherously opened 
fire on and disarmed the units returning from the front, 
and armed savage ³national² hordes. In order to lend 
greater firmness to the ³action² and secure itself from 
the North, the Transcaucasian Commissariat entered 
into an agreement with Karaulov and Kaledin, sent 
the latter whole wagon-loads of cartridges, helped him to 
disarm those units which it had been unable to disarm 
by itself, and is generally supporting his fight against

J. V. S T A L I N 56 
the Soviet power with every means at its disposal. 
Safeguarding the propertied classes of Transcaucasia 
from the revolutionary soldiers, and not shunning any 
means in doing so‹such is the essence of this vile ³policy.² 
Inciting armed detachments of unenlightened Moslems 
against the Russian soldiers, luring the latter 
into ambushes prepared in advance and shooting and 
slaughtering them‹such are the methods of this ³policy.² 
A consummate example of this shameful disarming 
³policy² was the shooting down at Shamkhor, between 
Yelizavetpol and Tiflis, of Russian soldiers proceeding 
from the Turkish Front against Kaledin. 
Here is what Bakinsky Rabochy11 reports about it: 
³In the first half of January 1918, on the railway line between 
Tiflis and Yelizavetpol, armed bands of Moslems many 
thousand strong, headed by members of the Yelizavetpol Moslem 
National Committee and with the support of an armoured train 
sent by the Transcaucasian Commissariat, forcibly disarmed a 
number of military units leaving for Russia. Thousands of Russian 
soldiers were killed or mutilated; the railway line was 
strewn with their corpses. They were deprived of about 15,000 
rifles, some 70 machine guns and a score of artillery pieces.² 
Such are the facts. 
An alliance of the landlords and bourgeoisie against 
the revolutionary soldiers of Transcaucasia, operating 
under the official guise of Menshevism‹such is the 
meaning of these facts. 
We consider it necessary to cite some excerpts from 
articles in Bakinsky Rabochy dealing with the Yelizavetpol-
Shamkhor events. 
³The Mensheviks are trying to conceal the truth about the 
Yelizavetpol events. Even Znamya Truda, the organ of their 
allies of yesterday, the Tiflis Socialist-Revolutionaries, notes their

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 57 
attempts to Œhush up the matter¹ and demands a public debate 
on the question in the regional centre. 
³We welcome this demand of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
because the future fate of the revolution in Transcaucasia will 
largely depend on whether or not the men responsible for the 
Shamkhor tragedy are officially exposed and full light is shed on 
the events of January 6-12. 
³We declare that the man chiefly responsible for the Yelizavetpol 
events is the one-time leader of the Caucasian Social- 
Democrats and the now so-called Œfather of the Georgian nation¹‹ 
Noah Nikolayevich Jordania. It was under his chairmanship that 
the presidium of the regional centre resolved to disarm the troop 
trains and arm national regiments with their weapons. It was 
he who signed the telegram sent to the Yelizavetpol Moslem 
National Committee ordering the disarmament of the troop trains 
held up near Shamkhor. It was he, Noah Jordania, who sent delegations 
from Tiflis with similar instructions to disarm the troop 
trains. This was officially stated by the soldier Krupko, member of 
a delegation, at a largely attended meeting of the Civilian Committee 
in Yelizavetpol. It was Noah Jordania and his always over-zealous 
assistant, N. Ramishvili, who sent the armoured train under 
the command of Abkhazava, who distributed arms to the Moslems 
and helped them in shooting thousands of soldiers and disarming 
the troop trains. 
³Noah Jordania is trying to exculpate himself and affirms 
that he did not sign the telegram. Dozens of people, Armenians 
and Moslems, declare that the telegram was signed by him, and 
this telegram exists. Jordania says that when he learned of the 
complications he telephoned to Abkhazava and requested him to 
refrain from forcibly disarming the troop trains and to let them 
pass through. Abkhazava was killed, and this statement cannot 
be verified, but we are prepared to grant that Jordania did talk 
with him. . . . 
³But apart from a dead man, on whom, as the saying goes, 
all blame can be thrown, there are living witnesses who deny 
Jordania¹s testimony and corroborate the address of the telegram, 
Jordania¹s signature, the sending of a delegation with instructions 
to disarm the soldiers, etc.

J. V. S T A L I N 58 
³If they are not telling the truth why does Jordania not 
take action against them? Why does he and his friends want to 
Œhush up the matter¹? 
³No, citizens Jordania, Ramishvili and Co., it is upon you 
that lies the grim responsibility for the blood of the thousands 
of soldiers killed on January 7-12. 
³Can you exonerate yourselves of this heinous crime? But 
we are not concerned with any personal exoneration. 
³Jordania interests us in this case not as a person, but as the 
leader of the party which decides the policy in Transcaucasia, 
as the most authoritative and responsible representative of the 
Transcaucasian government. 
³He perpetrated his criminal act, firstly, by decision of the 
presidium of the regional centre and the Inter-National Council, 
and, secondly, with the undoubted knowledge of the Transcaucasian 
Commissariat. The charge we hurl at Jordania extends to 
the whole Menshevik Party, to the regional centre and the Transcaucasian 
Commissariat, where Messrs. Chkhenkeli and Gegechkori, 
acting in a close and open bloc with the Moslem beys 
and khans, are doing everything to kill the revolution. We mention 
Jordania and Ramishvili because their names are linked 
with the telegrams and orders and the dispatch of the Œbandit¹ 
armoured train. It is with them that the investigation for the 
elucidation of the truth should begin. 
³And there are other names which must be mentioned; there 
is another criminal nest that must be wiped out. This is the Moslem 
National Committee in Yelizavetpol, made up entirely of reactionary 
beys and khans, which on the evening of January 7, 
on the basis of Jordania¹s telegram, resolved to disarm the troop 
trains Œat all costs,¹ and with incredible shamelessness and bloodthirstiness 
carried out its resolve on January 9-12. 
³The Menshevik press is trying to represent the Yelizavetpol 
events as nothing more than one of the Œbandit¹ raids on a railway 
usual in Transcaucasia. That is a most shameless lie! 
³It was not bandits, but thousands of Moslem civilians, officially 
directed by the Moslem National Committee, lured by the 
prospect of rich booty and confident that they were acting 
on the orders of the Transcaucasian authorities, who did the

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 59 
criminal work at Shamkhor and Dallyar. The Moslem National 
Committee openly massed thousands of Moslems in Yelizavetpol, 
armed them, entrained them at Yelizavetpol station and sent 
them to Shamkhor. And when the Œvictory¹ was won, eye-witnesses 
say, ŒSocialist-Revolutionary¹ Safikyurdsky triumphantly 
rode into the town sitting astride a gun captured from the 
Œenemy¹ and escorted by other heroes from the Moslem Committee. 
³What talk then can there be of bandit raids?² (Bakinsky 
Rabochy, Nos. 30 and 31.) 
So much for the chief heroes of this criminal adventure. 
And here are documents exposing the men behind it: 
Telegram to All Soviets from N. Jordania, Chairman of the 
Regional Centre of the Soviets of Workers¹, Soldiers¹ and Peasants¹ 
Deputies, on the Disarming of Troop Trains 
³To all the Transcaucasian Soviets. 
³From Tiflis. No. 505, a. Accepted: 6.1.1918, disp. No. 56363. 
Received: Naumov. 59 words. Delivered: 5-28-24. Circular. 
³In view of the fact that military units leaving for Russia 
are taking their weapons with them and that in the event of the 
armistice breaking down the national units may find themselves 
without sufficient arms to defend the front, the regional centre 
of the Soviets of Workers¹, Soldiers¹ and Peasants¹ Deputies has 
resolved to request all Soviets to take measures to deprive the 
departing units of their weapons and to report each such action 
to the regional centre. 
³Jordania, Chairman of Regional Centre.²

³Five armed troop trains and a gun on the way. They have 
seized representatives of the Soviet. Am proceeding by an armoured 
train to give resistance. Request assistance with all arms. 
³Captain Abkhazava 
³Ds. Shatirashvili.² 
(Bakinsky Rabochy, No. 33.) 
Such are the documents. 
Thus, in the course of the events the ³socialist² 
tinsel dropped away and gave place to the counter-revolutionary 
³actions² of the Transcaucasian Commissariat. 
Chkheidze, Gegechkori and Jordania are only using 
their party flag to cover up the abominations of the 
Transcaucasian Commissariat. The logic of facts is stronger 
than all other logic. 
In disarming the Russian soldiers arriving from the 
front, and thus fighting the ³external² revolutionaries, 
the counter-revolutionary Transcaucasian Commissariat 
hoped to kill two birds with one stone: on the one hand, 
it was destroying a serious revolutionary force, a Russian 
revolutionary army on which, chiefly, the Bolshevik 
Committee of the region might rely; on the other, it 
was obtaining in this way the ³necessary² weapons for 
arming the Georgian, Armenian and Moslem national 
regiments, which constitute the chief support of the counter-
revolutionary Menshevik Commissariat. War against 
³external² revolutionaries was thus intended to ensure 
³civil peace² in Transcaucasia. And Messrs. Gegechkori 
and Jordania carried out this treacherous policy 
the more resolutely the more secure they felt their ³rear, ³ 
that is, from the direction of the North Caucasus, with 
its Kaledins and Filimonovs.

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 61 
But the course of events upset all the calculations 
of the Transcaucasian counter-revolutionaries. 
The fall of Rostov and Novocherkassk, which had 
been the refuges of Kaledin and Kornilov, thoroughly 
shattered the ³northern rear.² It was liquidated altogether 
when the whole North Caucasian railway was cleared all the 
way to Baku. The tide of Soviet revolution sweeping down 
from the North unceremoniously invaded the kingdom of 
the Transcaucasian coalition and menaced its existence. 
Things developed just as ³unfavourably² within 
Transcaucasia itself. 
The Transcaucasian soldiers returning from the front 
spread the agrarian revolution through the countryside. 
The mansions of Moslem and Georgian landlords began 
to go up in flames. The pillars of the feudal survivals 
were vigorously attacked by the ³Bolshevized² soldierpeasants. 
Evidently, the Transcaucasian Commissariat¹s 
empty promises to turn over the land to the peasants 
could no longer satisfy the peasants swept by the agrarian 
tide. Action was demanded of it‹and revolutionary, not 
counter-revolutionary action. 
Nor did the workers lag behind events; they could 
not. Firstly, the revolution sweeping down from the 
North and bringing new gains to the workers naturally 
roused the Transcaucasian proletariat to a new 
struggle. Even the workers of sleepy Tiflis, that 
stronghold of Menshevik counter-revolution, began to 
turn their backs on the Transcaucasian Commissariat 
and declare in favour of Soviet power. Secondly, after 
the triumph of the Soviets in the North Caucasus, which 
under Kaledin and Filimonov had supplied Tiflis with 
grain, the food shortage was bound to become more

J. V. S T A L I N 62 
acute, and this naturally provoked a number of food 
³riots²‹revolutionary North Caucasus categorically refuses 
to feed counter-revolutionary Tiflis. Thirdly, the 
shortage of currency notes (coupons are no substitute!) 
disrupted economic life, and primarily railway transport, 
which undoubtedly added to the discontent of the 
urban masses. Lastly, revolutionary proletarian Baku, 
which recognized the Soviet power from the very first 
days of the October Revolution and is waging an indefatigable 
struggle against the Transcaucasian Commissariat, 
kept the Transcaucasian proletariat active and 
served as an infectious example, as a living beacon illuminating 
the path to socialism. 
All this, taken together, could not but revolutionize 
the whole political situation in Transcaucasia. So much 
so, that in the end even the ³most reliable² national 
regiments began to be ³disaffected² and to pass over to 
the Bolsheviks. 
The Transcaucasian Commissariat was faced with the 
alternatives: 
Either to side with the workers and peasants against 
the landlords and capitalists, which would mean the 
collapse of the coalition. 
Or to wage a determined fight against the peasants 
and the working class movement in order to preserve 
the coalition with the landlords and capitalists. 
Messrs. Jordania and Gegechkori chose the latter 
course. 
To begin with, the Transcaucasian Commissariat 
branded the agrarian movement of the Georgian and 
Tatar peasants as ³banditry² and ³hooliganism,² and 
began to arrest and shoot the ³ringleaders.²

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 63 
For the landlords against the peasants! 
Next, the Commissariat banned all the Bolshevik 
newspapers in Tiflis, and began to arrest and shoot workers 
who protested against this outrage. 
For the capitalists against the workers! 
Lastly, things have gone so far that Messrs. Jordania 
and Gegechkori are encouraging Armenian-Tatar 
massacres, evidently as a ³lightning conductor²‹a disgrace 
to which even the Cadets have not yet sunk! 
The Transcaucasian Commissariat, the Transcaucasian 
Diet and the ³National Councils² against the 
workers and peasants‹that is the meaning of the ³new² 
course. 
Thus, the Transcaucasian counter-revolutionaries are 
furthering and supplementing their fight against the 
³external² revolutionaries, the Russian soldiers, with 
a fight against the internal revolutionaries, ³their own² 
workers and peasants. 
A very interesting illustration of this ³change of 
front² in the policy of the Transcaucasian coalitionists 
is to be found in a letter received the other day by the 
Council of People¹s Commissars from a comrade in the 
Caucasus, an eye-witness of the counter-revolutionary 
excesses of Messrs. Gegechkori and Jordania. I shall 
reproduce it in full and without alteration. Here it is: 
³Further incidents have occurred here in the past few days, 
and the situation is now very serious. On the morning of February 9 
four of our comrades were arrested, among them a member of the 
now Bolshevik Committee, F. Kalandadze. Warrants were issued 
for the arrest of other comrades: Filipp Makharadze, Nazaretyan, 
Shaverdov and other members of the regional committee. Only 
Mikha Tskhakaya was spared, presumably because of his illness. 
All have gone underground. This was accompanied by the banning

J. V. S T A L I N 64 
of our newspapers, Kavkazsky Rabochy, Brdzola (Georgian), 
and Banvori Kriv (Armenian), and the sealing up of our printing 
plant. 
³This aroused the indignation of the workers. That same day, 
the 9th, a meeting was held in the railway shops, attended by 
some three thousand workers. They decided unanimously, with 
only four abstentions, to declare a strike in support of the demand 
for the release of the comrades and the removal of the ban on the 
newspapers. It was decided to stay out until the demands were 
met. But the strike was only partial. The out-and-out Menshevik 
gang, who did not raise objections at the meeting and did not vote 
against, went on working. That same day there was a meeting 
of compositors and printers, who decided by 226 votes to 190 to 
hold a one-day protest strike in support of the same demands. 
More unanimous were the strike decisions of the electricians, 
leather workers, tailors, the arsenal shops, and the Tolle, Zargaryants 
and other factories. 
³The indignation was shared by the townsfolk. But the next 
day, February 10, an incident occurred which caused the arrests 
and the newspapers to be forgotten. 
³The strike committee of the railway and other workers had 
appointed a protest meeting for that day, on the 10th, in the 
morning, to be held in the Alexander Gardens. Despite the measures 
taken to prevent the meeting, more than 3,000 workers and soldiers 
turned out (there were not many soldiers because the troop 
trains are located 15 versts from the city). Kavtaradze, Makharadze, 
Nazaretyan and other comrades who had gone into hiding also 
appeared at the meeting. While the meeting was in progress 
militiamen and ŒRed Guards¹ (about two companies strong) 
entered the gardens. Carrying red banners, and making reassuring 
gestures, they stole up to the gathering. 
³Part of the public who were already intending to disperse decided 
to stay on, taking the newcomers for sympathizers, and even 
greeted them with cheers. Chairman Kavtaradze was about to stop 
the speaker on the platform in order to welcome the newcomers, 
when the latter suddenly formed a cordon, surrounded the meeting 
and opened fierce fire with rifles and machine guns. They aimed 
chiefly at the presidium on the platform. Eight persons were killed

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 65 
and more than twenty wounded. A comrade who resembled Kavtaradze 
and was dressed like him received ten bullets and was 
killed, and the ŒRed Guards¹ shouted to one another that 
Kavtaradze was killed. Part of the public dispersed, the rest dropped 
to the ground. The firing continued about a quarter of an hour. 
³At this very moment the first session of the enlarged Transcaucasian 
Diet had just opened, and Chkheidze was addressing 
it to the accompaniment of the rifles and machine guns which 
were blazing away right near the palace. 
³This massacre, started so treacherously and without warning, 
has aroused fresh indignation among the workers, and I think that 
i t has finally and definitely estranged them from the Mensheviks. 
³Nazaretyan and Tsintsadze were overtaken after the meeting 
and led away to be shot, but they were saved by Merkhalev, 
a Socialist-Revolutionary. The Socialist-Revolutionaries are Œindignant,¹ 
are protesting and so on. The Dashnaktsakans are indignant 
too, and so is the whole town. But nothing can be done. They have 
brought in from the country districts armed Œ¹Red Guards¹ and 
a Moslem Savage Division and are running riot. They are publicly 
threatening to shoot all our leading comrades. The day the 
meeting was fired on, many officers appeared in the town 
wearing white armlets. They were whiteguards who began to 
scour the city looking for Bolsheviks. They took one man who 
looked like Shaumyan off a tram car and shot him point blank. 
They shouted out that it was Shaumyan, but they were disappointed. 
³Yesterday, the 11th, a meeting was held at the troop trains 
at which some of our comrades were present. There are about 
6,000 soldiers there, but without artillery. They decided to demand 
the release of the arrested comrades, the removal of the ban on 
our newspapers and an investigation of the incident of the 10th 
(the firing on the meeting, at which, incidentally, one of the 
soldiers from these troop trains was killed). Yesterday they 
sent a delegation with an ultimatum, and gave 24 hours for 
a reply. 
³The time limit expires today. It is reported that the Commissariat 
is massing forces for resistance. I have no details yet.

J. V. S T A L I N 66 
The responsible comrades are not returning from the troop trains 
yet, because they fear that they may be arrested on the way; they 
have been elected to the Revolutionary Military Committee of the 
troop trains there. I am awaiting more detailed information. 
³A meeting of the City Duma has been appointed for tomorrow. 
The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Dashnaks will make a protest; 
we shall have our representatives there too. The city is in 
a state of deep alarm. Women demonstrated today outside the 
Duma in connection with the food shortage which has begun to 
make itself felt. Lightning meetings are being held everywhere 
in the city. A peasant movement is breaking out all over Georgia 
under the influence of the Georgian soldiers returning from Russia, 
who are all either Bolsheviks or pro-Bolsheviks. The Mensheviks 
say it is a movement of rioters and bandits, and are sending 
ŒRed Guards¹ to suppress it. Some of our comrades in Gori 
have been arrested. It is reported today that our soldiers there 
have been disarmed and that shootings have already begun. There 
is information from Kutais that the town is in the hands of the 
Bolsheviks, headed by Budu Mdivani. The Mensheviks have 
massed forces there from all parts. I have had no reply yet from 
the messengers we sent; I expect i t any minute. Yesterday a 
Bolshevik, the old Tsertsvadze, was arrested in Mukhrani; he had 
gone there in connection with the peasant action which was 
expected yesterday against the Mukhrani princes and the crown 
estates. 
³Nine men have been arrested and are at present imprisoned 
in the Metekhi. Because of these arrests, the Socialist-Revolutionary 
Red Guards who guarded this prison have refused to do so 
any longer and have offered us their services. 
³Yesterday the strike committee of representatives from the 
enterprises I enumerated at the beginning of this letter issued an 
appeal for a general strike. Today it is being discussed everywhere. 
We shall see what stuff the Tiflis proletariat is made of. 
³At the opening of the Diet on February 10 only the Mensheviks 
(there are 37 of them) and one Moslem were present‹and 
nobody else. The Moslem deputy asked for the sitting to be 
adjourned to the 13th, which was done. The Dashnaks and the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries will probably also send their deputies.²

TRANSCAUCASIAN COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARIES 67 
That is the ³picture.² 
It is hard to say whether this counter-revolutionary 
Commissariat, on which history has already passed sentence 
of death, can go on existing much longer. This, 
at any rate, the very near future will show. One thing, 
however, is certain: the recent events have definitely 
torn the socialist mask from the faces of the Menshevik 
social-counter-revolutionaries, and the whole revolutionary 
world can now clearly see that in the Transcaucasian 
Commissariat and its appendages, the ³Diet² and 
³National Councils,² we are faced with a most vicious 
counter-revolutionary bloc directed against the workers 
and peasants of Transcaucasia. 
Such are the facts. 
Well, and everyone knows that talk and tinsel are 
short-lived, but facts and deeds live on. . . .

ORGANISATION OF A RUSSIAN 
FEDERAL REPUBLIC 
Pravda Interview 
In connection with the discussion that has developed in the 
past few days in the Soviet press on the principles and methods 
of constituting a Russian Federation, our correspondent requested 
the opinion of Comrade Stalin, People¹s Commissar for the Affairs 
of Nationalities. 
The following is Comrade Stalin¹s reply to a series of questions 
put by our correspondent. 
BOURGEOIS-DEMOCRATIC FEDERATIONS 
Of all the existing federal unions, the most characteristic 
of the bourgeois-democratic system are the American 
and Swiss federations. Historically, they evolved 
from independent states, through confederations, into 
federations, but in fact they became unitary states, federalism 
being preserved only in form. This whole process 
of development‹from independence to unitarism‹ 
proceeded to the accompaniment of violence, oppression 
and national wars. Suffice it to recall the war 
between the Southern and Northern states of America12 
and the war between the Sonderbund13 and the 
other cantons in Switzerland. Nor can one refrain from 
observing that the Swiss cantons and the American

ORGANISATION OF A RUSSIAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC 69 
states were built not on national, nor even on economic 
lines, but quite by chance‹by virtue of the chance 
seizure of this or that territory by colonial immigrants 
or village communities. 
HOW THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION NOW IN PROCESS 
OF FORMATION DIFFERS FROM THEM 
The federation now being built in Russia presents, 
and should present, an entirely different picture. 
Firstly, the regions which have separated out in 
Russia represent quite definite units as regards manner 
of life and national composition. The Ukraine, the Crimea, 
Poland, Transcaucasia, Turkestan, the Middle 
Volga, and the Kirghiz territory are distinct from the 
centre not only because of their geographical location 
(border regions!), but also because they are integral 
economic territories having a population with a specific 
manner of life and national composition. 
Secondly, these regions are not free and independent 
territories, but units which were forcibly squeezed into 
the all-Russian political organism, and which are now 
striving to secure the necessary freedom of action in the 
shape either of federal relations or complete independence. 
The history of the ³union² of these territories is one 
long tale of violence and oppression on the part of the 
former Russian governments. The establishment of a 
federal system in Russia will mean the emancipation 
of these territories and the peoples inhabiting them from 
the old imperialist yoke. From unitarism to federalism! 
Thirdly, in the Western federations the shaping of 
the state is in the hands of the imperialist bourgeoisie.

J. V. S T A L I N 70 
Small wonder, then, that ³union² there could not be 
effected without violence. Here, in Russia, on the contrary, 
the shaping of the political structure is in the hands of the 
proletariat, the sworn enemy of imperialism. In Russia, 
therefore, the federal system can, and must, be built on 
the basis of a free union of peoples. 
That is the essential difference between the federation 
in Russia and the federations of the West. 
STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES 
OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION 
It is clear from this, Comrade Stalin continued, 
that the Russian Federation is not a union of independent 
cities (as caricaturists in the bourgeois press think), or of 
regions generally (as some of our comrades believe), but 
a union of definite historically evolved territories, each 
distinguished by a specific manner of life and national 
composition. The point is not the geographical location of 
certain regions, or even that certain areas are separated 
from the centre by stretches of water (Turkestan), or 
mountain ranges (Siberia), or steppes (Turkestan again). 
This geographical federalism, such as is preached by 
Latsis, has nothing in common with the federalism 
proclaimed by the Third Congress of Soviets. Poland and 
the Ukraine are not separated from the centre by mountain 
ranges or stretches of water. Nevertheless it would 
not enter anyone¹s head to assert that the absence of these 
geographical attributes precludes the right of these 
regions to free self-determination. 
On the other hand, Comrade Stalin said, it is unquestionable 
that the peculiar form of federalism advo

ORGANISATION OF A RUSSIAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC 71 
cated by the Moscow regionalists, who would artificially 
unite fourteen gubernias around Moscow, has 
likewise nothing in common with the resolution on federation 
of the Third Congress of Soviets. Undoubtedly, 
the central textile area, which embraces only a few 
gubernias, does in a way represent an integral economic 
unit, and as such it will undoubtedly be administered 
by a regional authority of its own, as an autonomous 
part of the Supreme Council of National Economy. 
But what can there be in common between backwoods 
Kaluga and industrial Ivanovo-Voznesensk, and 
on what principle they are ³united² by the present regional 
Council of People¹s Commissars is beyond comprehension. 
COMPOSITION OF THE RUSSIAN 
FEDERAL REPUBLIC 
Obviously, not every area or unit, and not every 
geographical territory can or should become a member of 
the federation, but only definite regions which naturally 
combine a specific manner of life, a specific national 
composition, and a certain minimum integrality of 
economic territory. Such are Poland, the Ukraine, 
Finland, the Crimea, Transcaucasia (incidentally, the possibility 
is not excluded that Transcaucasia may break 
up into a number of definite national-territorial units, 
e.g., Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan-Tatar, etc.), Turkestan, 
the Kirghiz territory, the Tatar-Bashkir territory, 
Siberia and so on.

J. V. S T A L I N 72 
RIGHTS OF FEDERATING REGIONS. 
RIGHTS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES 
The rights of these federating regions will be definitely 
delimited in the process of constituting the 
Soviet Federation as a whole, but the general outline 
of these rights can be indicated already. Military and 
naval affairs, foreign affairs, railways, post and telegraph, 
currency, trade agreements and general economic, financial 
and banking policy will probably all come within the 
province of the central Council of People¹s Commissars. 
All other affairs, and primarily the methods of implementation 
of general decrees, education, judicature, administration, 
etc., will come within the province of the regional 
Councils of People¹s Commissars. No compulsory 
³state² language‹either in the judicature or in the educational 
system! Each region will select the language 
or languages which correspond to the composition of 
its population, and there will be complete equality of 
languages both of the minorities and the majorities in 
all social and political institutions. 
STRUCTURE OF THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY 
The structure of the central authority, its manner 
of constitution, is determined by the specific features 
of the Russian Federation. In America and Switzerland, 
federalism resulted in practice in a two-chamber system: 
on the one hand, a parliament elected on the basis of 
general elections, and, on the other, a federal council 
constituted by the states or cantons. That is the

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
73 
two-chamber system which in practice leads to the 
usual bourgeois legislative red tape. Needless to say, 
the labouring masses of Russia would not reconcile 
themselves to such a two-chamber system. And this 
apart from the fact that such a system is wholly 
incompatible with the elementary demands of socialism.
We think, Comrade Stalin continued, that the supreme 
organ of power of the Russian Federation should be 
the Congress of Soviets elected by all the labouring masses 
of Russia, or the Central Executive Committee, acting 
as its deputy. Moreover, we shall have to discard the 
bourgeois prejudice regarding the infallibility of the 
³principle² of universal suffrage. The suffrage will probably 
be granted only to those sections of the population 
which are exploited, or which at least do not exploit the 
labour of others. That is a natural corollary of the fact 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasants 
THE EXECUTIVE ORGAN OF POWER 
As to the organ of executive power of the Russian 
Federation, i.e., the central Council of People¹s Commissars, 
it will be elected at the Congresses of Soviets, presumably 
from candidates nominated by the centre and 
the federating regions. Thus between the Central Executive 
Committee and the Council of People¹s Commissars 
there will not be, and should not be, any so-called second 
chamber. Without a doubt, practice may, and probably 
will, evolve other and more expedient and flexible 
forms of combining the interests of the regions and the 
ORGANISATION OF A RUSSIAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC

J. V. S T A L I N 74 
centre in the structure of authority. But one thing is 
certain: namely, that whatever forms may be evolved in 
practice, they will not resurrect the obsolete two-chamber 
system which has been buried by our revolution. 
TRANSITIONAL FUNCTION OF FEDERALISM 
These, in my opinion, Comrade Stalin continued, 
are the general contours of the Russian Federation whose 
process of constitution we are now witnessing. Many 
are inclined to regard the federal system as the most 
stable, and even as ideal, and America, Canada and 
Switzerland are often cited as examples. But this 
infatuation with federalism is not warranted by history. 
In the first place, America and Switzerland are 
no longer federations: they were federations in the 
1860¹s, but they have in fact become unitary states 
since the end of the last century, when all authority 
was transferred from the states or cantons to the central 
federal government. 
History has shown that federalism in America and 
Switzerland was only a transitional step from the independence 
of the states or cantons to their complete 
union. Federalism proved quite expedient as a transitional 
step from independence to imperialist unitarism, 
but it became out of date and was discarded as soon as 
the conditions matured for the union of the states or 
cantons into a single integral state.

SHAPING THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE 
OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. FEDERALISM 
IN RUSSIA‹A TRANSITIONAL STEP 
TO SOCIALIST UNITARISM 
In Russia, constitutional development is proceeding 
in a reverse way. Compulsory tsarist unitarism is 
being replaced by voluntary federalism, in order that, 
in the course of time, federalism may be replaced by an 
equally voluntary and fraternal union of the labouring 
masses of all the nations and races of Russia. As in 
America and Switzerland, Comrade Stalin concluded, 
federalism in Russia is destined to serve as a means 
of transition‹transition to the socialist unitarism of 
the future. 
Pravda, Nos. 62 and 63, 
April 3 and 4, 1918

ONE IMMEDIATE TASK 
The past two months of development of the revolution 
in Russia, especially the period following the conclusion 
of peace with Germany and the suppression of 
the bourgeois counter-revolution at home, may be described 
as a period of consolidation of Soviet power 
in Russia and the beginning of a systematic reconstruction 
of the outlived social and economic system 
on new, socialist lines. The growing scale of nationalization 
of mills and factories, the increasing control 
over the major branches of trade, the nationalization 
of the banks, the daily developing, richly diverse 
activities of the Supreme Council of National Economy‹
that organizational nucleus of the socialist society 
which is already close at hand‹all go to show how 
deeply Soviet power is penetrating into the pores of social 
life. The power at the centre has become a real people¹s 
power that has sprung from the depths of the labouring 
masses. Therein lies the strength and might of Soviet 
power. This, evidently, is being sensed even by those 
former enemies of the Soviet regime, the bourgeois intellectuals‹
the technicians, engineers, office workers and 
people with specialized knowledge generally‹who yesterday 
were still sabotaging the regime, but are today prepared 
to serve it.

ONE IMMEDIATE TASK 77 
But Soviet power has not yet succeeded in becoming 
a people¹s power to quite the same extent in the border 
regions inhabited by culturally backward elements. The 
revolution begun in the centre spread to the border 
regions, especially the eastern, with a certain amount 
of delay. Conditions as regards language and manner of life 
in these regions, which are moreover economically backward, 
have somewhat complicated the consolidation of 
Soviet power there. In order that the power there might 
become a people¹s power, and the labouring masses become 
socialist, it is necessary, among other things, to devise 
special methods of drawing the labouring and exploited 
masses of these regions into the process of revolutionary 
development. It is necessary to raise the masses to the 
level of Soviet power, and to identify their finest representatives 
with it. But this is impossible unless these 
regions are autonomous, that is, have their own schools, 
courts, administrations, organs of power and social, 
political and cultural institutions, and unless the labouring 
masses of these regions are fully guaranteed the 
right to use their own language in all spheres of social 
and political activity. 
It was with this object in view that the Third Congress 
of Soviets proclaimed a federal system for the 
Russian Soviet Republic. 
The bourgeois autonomous groups which arose last 
November and December in the Volga-Tatar, the Bashkir 
and Kirghiz regions and the Turkestan region 
are being gradually exposed by the course of the revolution. 
In order completely to sever ³their own masses² 
from them and rally them around the Soviets, it is necessary 
to ³take² their autonomy from them, first cleanse

J. V. S T A L I N 78 
it of its bourgeois contamination, and then convert it 
from bourgeois into Soviet autonomy. The bourgeois 
nationalist groups demand autonomy in order to make 
i t an instrument for enslaving ³their own² masses. 
That is why, while ³recognizing the central Soviet 
power,² they refuse to recognize the local Soviets, 
and demand that there shall be no interference in their 
³internal affairs.² In view of this some of the local Soviets 
have decided to repudiate every form of autonomy 
whatsoever, and prefer to ³settle² the national question 
by force of arms. But this course is absolutely unsuitable 
for the Soviet power. It is a course that is capable only of 
rallying the masses behind the bourgeois-national upper 
sections, and of giving the latter the appearance of being 
saviours of the ³motherland,² defenders of the ³nation,² 
which by no means fits in with the plans of the Soviet power. 
Not repudiation, but recognition of autonomy is the 
immediate task of the Soviet power. But this autonomy 
must be based on the local Soviets. Only in this way 
can the power become a people¹s power, the masses¹ own 
power. Consequently, autonomy must ensure power to 
the lower, not the upper, sections of the given nation. 
That is the whole point. 
It is for this reason that the Soviet Government preclaims 
the autonomy of the Tatar-Bashkir territory. For 
this reason, too, it is planned to proclaim the autonomy 
of the Kirghiz territory, the Turkestan region, etc. All 
this on the basis of the recognition of the local volost, 
uyezd and urban Soviets of these border regions. 
All the necessary material and data must be collected 
for determining the character and form of autonomy 
of these territories. Commissions must be appointed

ONE IMMEDIATE TASK 79 
for convening constituent congresses of the Soviets and 
Soviet organs of the given peoples, at which the geographical 
boundaries of these autonomous units shall be 
defined. These congresses must be convened. This essential 
preparatory work must be done immediately in order 
that a future All-Russian Congress of Soviets may be 
in a position to frame a Constitution of the Russian 
Soviet Federation. 
The Soviets of the Tatar-Bashkir territory and their 
Moslem Commissariats have already set to work. By 
the 10th or 15th of April, a conference of representatives 
of the Soviets and Moslem Commissariats of Kazan, 
Ufa, Orenburg and Yekaterinburg will meet in Moscow 
to appoint a commission for convening a constituent 
congress of Soviets of Tatar-Bashkiria. 
In the Kirghiz territory and Turkestan measures 
in this direction are only just beginning to be taken. 
The Soviets of these regions should set to work at once, 
and enlist in it all the Soviet and revolutionary elements 
of the peoples concerned. No division into national 
curiae, with representation from national ³minorities² 
and ³majorities,² as certain bourgeois nationalist 
groups are suggesting, should be allowed. Such division 
only sharpens national animosities, reinforces the barriers 
between the labouring masses of the nationalities, and 
bars the backward peoples from the path to enlightenment 
and culture. The elections to the constituent 
congresses must be based, and autonomy founded, not 
on splitting the labouring and democratic masses of 
the nationalities into separate national detachments, 
but on rallying them around the respective unions of 
Soviets.

J. V. S T A L I N 80 
Hence the task of the Soviets is to gather materials 
on the autonomy of the border regions, to establish 
socialist national commissariats of the Soviets, to appoint 
commissions for convening constituent congresses 
of Soviets of the autonomous regions, to convene these 
congresses, and to establish close ties between the labouring 
sections of the peoples exercising self-determination 
and the organs of Soviet power in the regions. 
The People¹s Commissariat for the-Affairs of Nationalities 
will do everything in its power to facilitate 
this difficult and responsible work of the Soviets in the 
localities.

GENERAL PROVISIONS 
OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN 
SOCIALIST FEDERATIVE 
SOVIET REPUBLIC 
Draft Approved by the Commission Appointed 
by the All-Russian C.E.C. for Drafting the Constitution 
of the Soviet Republic14 
The main objective of the Constitution of the Russian 
Socialist Federative Soviet Republic adapted to the present 
transitional period is to establish a dictatorship of 
the urban and rural proletariat and the poor peasantry, 
in the form of a strong all-Russian Soviet power, for 
the purpose of completely suppressing the bourgeoisie, 
abolishing the exploitation of man by man, and introducing 
socialism, under which there will be neither 
division into classes nor a state power. 
1. The Russian Republic is a free socialist society 
of all the working people of Russia, united in urban 
and rural Soviets of Deputies. 
2. The Soviets of Deputies of regions distinguished 
by a specific manner of life and national composition 
are combined into autonomous regional unions, headed 
by regional Congresses of Soviets and their executive 
bodies.

J. V. S T A L I N 82 
3. The Soviet regional unions are combined on a 
federal basis into a Russian Socialist Republic, at the 
head of which is the All-Russian Congress of Soviets 
and, in the intervals between congresses, the All-Russian 
Central Executive Committee.

You may rest assured, comrades, that the Council of 
People¹s Commissars will support the establishment of 
autonomy in your region on a Soviet basis. We welcome 
your initiative and are firmly convinced that you will 
cover the whole region with a network of Soviets, and 
will work in full contact with the already existing Soviets. 
We request you to send the commission for convening 
a constituent congress of Soviets, which you have undertaken 
to appoint, to us in Moscow for the purpose of 
jointly determining the relations between the organ of 
authority of your region and the Council of People¹s 
Commissars. 
We hail your Congress and hope that it will accomplish 
with credit the tasks entrusted to it by history.

THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE UKRAINE 
Izvestia Interview 
Interviewed by our correspondent, Comrade Stalin, Chairman 
of the Soviet peace delegation, whom the Council of People¹s 
Commissars has called from Kursk to Moscow to report, stated the 
following: 
CONCLUSION OF AN ARMISTICE 
The first objective of the Soviet peace delegation 
was to establish an armistice at the front, on the Ukrainian 
border. It was on these lines that our peace delegation 
began negotiations with the German-Ukrainian 
command. We have succeeded in securing a truce on 
the Kursk, Bryansk and Voronezh fronts. The next 
question is to secure a truce on the Southern Front. 
Thus, the conclusion of an armistice and the establishment 
of a demarcation line constitute, in our opinion, 
the first stage of the peace negotiations. 
SUBSEQUENT NEGOTIATIONS 
Our next objective‹the opening of the peace negotiations 
themselves‹was complicated by the fact that we 
had to wait a long time for the arrival of the delegation

THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UKRAINE 85 
from the Central Rada. When it did at last arrive in 
Vorozhba, news was received of the coup d¹état and the 
abolition of the Small and Grand Radas in the Ukraine, 
which, of course, hampered the establishment of an armistice 
and the preliminary arrangements for determining 
the time and place for opening the negotiations. 
For the latter purpose, we have sent a special parliamentary 
to Konotop, the place proposed by the Ukrainian- 
German command, and where its general headquarters 
is located. Our delegate has been given wide powers 
in the matter of arranging the place of negotiations. 
EFFECT OF THE COUP D¹ÉTAT IN THE UKRAINE 
It is difficult to say definitely what effect the coup 
d¹état in the Ukraine will have on the peace negotiations, 
since we do not know the attitude of the new Ukrainian 
Government towards the peace negotiations. Nothing was 
said on this point in Hetman Skoropadsky¹s manifesto. 
Before the coup we had a definite peace programme 
of the Ukrainian Rada. But what the territorial programme 
of the new Ukrainian Government is, we do 
not know. 
In general, however, the Ukrainian coup has so far 
had no adverse effect on the peace negotiations. On the 
contrary, there is reason to believe that the coup does not 
preclude the possibility of peace being arranged between 
the Soviet Government and the Ukrainian Government. 
It should be observed that since the coup the vacillations 
and delays of the Ukrainians in respect to the preliminary 
arrangements for the peace negotiations have 
ceased.

J. V. S T A L I N 86 
CAUSES OF THE COUP D¹ÉTAT 
At the end of the interview Comrade Stalin touched on the 
causes of the coup d¹état in the Ukraine. 
In my opinion, the coup was inevitable. The reasons 
for it lay in the self-contradictory position of the Central 
Rada: on the one hand, it played with socialism; on the 
other, it called in foreign troops to fight the Ukrainian 
workers and peasants. The Central Rada made itself 
dependent financially and militarily on Germany, and 
at the same time it handed out a heap of promises to the 
Ukrainian workers and peasants, with whom it was soon 
waging determined warfare. By this last step the Ukrainian 
Rada placed itself in a position in which, at the critical 
moment of the assault of the bourgeois and landlord 
elements, it had nobody to rely on. 
And, in fact, the Central Rada could not have remained 
in power long by virtue of the law of the class struggle, 
since in the process of a revolutionary movement only 
such elements can firmly establish themselves in power as 
are supported by one class or another. Only two possible 
outcomes were therefore conceivable in the Ukraine: either 
a dictatorship of the workers and peasants, which the 
Central Rada could not help to bring about owing to 
its petty-bourgeois nature; or a dictatorship of the bourgeois 
and landlord elements, to which also the Rada 
could not consent. It preferred a half-way position, and 
thereby signed its own death warrant.

SPEECHES DELIVERED 
AT A CONFERENCE ON THE CONVENING 
OF A CONSTITUENT CONGRESS 
OF SOVIETS OF THE TATAR-BASHKIR 
SOVIET REPUBLIC 
May 10-16, 191816 
1. SPEECH AT THE OPENING 
OF THE CONFERENCE 
May 10 
Comrades, this conference has been called on the 
initiative of the Commissariat for the Affairs of Nationalities 
and in agreement with the Council of People¹s 
Commissars, in the person of its Chairman. 
The purpose of the conference is to set up a commission 
for convening a constituent congress of Soviets 
of your region. The purpose of the future congress will 
be to determine the frontiers and character of Tatar- 
Bashkir autonomy. The idea of autonomy springs from 
the very nature of the October Revolution, which brought 
liberty to the nationalities. The Declaration of Rights 
of the Peoples of Russia issued by the Council of People¹s 
Commissars in the October days, and the decision of the 
Third Congress of Soviets proclaiming Russia a federation 
of autonomous regions distinguished by a specific manner 
of life and composition of the population, are only a formal 
expression of the nature of the October Revolution.

J. V. S T A L I N 88 
The Third Congress of Soviets laid down general 
provisions of the Constitution of the Soviet Republic, 
and called upon the labouring elements of the peoples 
of Russia to say in what concrete political forms they 
would like to constitute themselves in their regions, 
and in what relations they would like to stand to the 
centre. Of all the regions, Finland and the Ukraine, I 
think, are the only ones that have declared themselves 
definitely. They have declared in favour of independence. 
And when the Council of People¹s Commissars became 
convinced that not only the bourgeoisie, but also the 
proletarian elements of these countries were striving for 
independence, these countries received what they demanded 
without any hindrance. 
As to the other regions, their labouring elements 
have proved to be rather inert in the matter of the national 
movement. But the greater their inertia the greater was 
the activity displayed by the bourgeoisie. Nearly everywhere, 
in all the regions, bourgeois autonomous groups 
were formed which set up ³National Councils,² split their 
regions into separate national curiae, with national regiments, 
national budgets, etc., and thus turned their countries 
into arenas of national conflict and chauvinism. 
These autonomous groups (I am referring to the Tatar, 
Bashkir, Kirghiz, Georgian, Armenian and other ³National 
Councils²)‹all these ³National Councils² were out 
for one thing only, namely, to secure autonomy so that 
the central government should not interfere in their affairs 
and not control them. ³Give us autonomy and we shall 
recognize the central Soviet power, but we cannot recognize 
the local Soviets and they must not interfere in our 
affairs; we shall organize ourselves as we wish and can,

SPEECHES DELIVERED AT A CONFERENCE, MAY 10-16, 1918 89 
and shall treat our national workers and peasants as 
we please.² That is the sort of autonomy‹essentially 
bourgeois in character‹aimed at by the bourgeoisie who 
demand full power over ³their² working people within 
the framework of autonomy. 
It goes without saying that the Soviet power cannot 
sanction autonomy of this kind. To grant autonomy 
in order that all power within the autonomous 
unit may belong to the national bourgeoisie, who insist 
upon non-interference on the part of the Soviets, to 
surrender the Tatar, Bashkir, Georgian, Kirghiz, Armenian 
and other workers to the tender mercies of 
the Tatar, Georgian, Armenian and other bourgeois‹ 
that is something to which the Soviet power cannot 
consent. 
Autonomy is a form. The whole question is what 
class content is put into this form. The Soviet power is 
not at all opposed to autonomy. It is in favour of autonomy‹
but only such autonomy in which the entire power 
belongs to the workers and peasants, and in which the 
bourgeois of all nationalities are debarred not only from 
power, but even from participation in the election of government 
bodies. 
Such autonomy will be autonomy on a Soviet basis. 
There are two types of autonomy. One is purely 
nationalistic. It is built on the principle of extra-territoriality, 
on the basis of nationalism. The outcome of 
this type of autonomy is ³National Councils,² with 
national regiments around these councils, division of 
the population into national curiae, and the national 
strife which is bound to follow from this. That type of 
autonomy spells inevitable doom for the Soviets of

J. V. S T A L I N 90 
Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Deputies. It is the type of autonomy 
which the bourgeois Rada was out for. In order to 
grow and develop, the Rada had naturally to wage war 
on the workers¹ and peasants¹ Soviets. That has also been 
the outcome of the existence of the Armenian, Georgian 
and Tatar National Councils in Transcaucasia. Gegechkori 
was right when he said to the Transcaucasian 
Soviets and the Commissariat: ³Do you know that the 
Commissariat and the Soviets have become a fiction, 
since all power has actually passed into the hands of the 
National Councils, which possess their own national 
regiments?² 
That type of autonomy we reject in principle. 
We propose another type of autonomy, autonomy 
for regions where one or several nationalities predominate. 
No national curiae, no national barriers! Autonomy 
must be Soviet autonomy, based on Soviets. This means 
that the division of the population of the given region 
must be on class, not national lines. Class Soviets as 
the basis of autonomy, and autonomy as the form 
of expression of the will of these Soviets‹such is the 
nature of the Soviet autonomy we propose. 
The bourgeois world has elaborated one definite 
form of relation between autonomous regions and the 
central authority. I am referring to the United States 
of America, Canada and Switzerland. In these countries 
the central authority consists of a national parliament 
of the whole country, elected by the entire population 
of the states (or cantons), and, parallel with this, a federal 
council, chosen by the governments of the states 
(or cantons). The result is a two-chamber system, with

SPEECHES DELIVERED AT A CONFERENCE, MAY 10-16, 1918 91 
its legislative red tape and the stifling of all revolutionary 
initiative. 
We are opposed to such a constitution of authority 
in our country. We are opposed to it not only because 
socialism categorically repudiates such a two-chamber 
system, but also because of the practical exigencies of 
the period we are passing through. The fact is that in 
the present transitional period, when the bourgeoisie 
has been broken but not crushed, when the disruption 
of economic life and of the food supply, aggravated by 
the machinations of the bourgeoisie, has not yet been 
eliminated, and when the old, capitalist world has been 
shattered but the new, socialist world has not yet been 
completely built‹at such a moment the country 
needs a strong all-Russian power capable of crushing 
the enemies of socialism completely and organizing a 
new, communist economy. In short, what we need is that 
which has come to be called the dictatorship of the urban 
and rural proletariat. To set up sovereign local and 
regional authorities parallel with the central authority 
at such a moment would in fact result in the collapse 
of all authority and a reversion to capitalism. For this 
reason, all functions of importance to the whole country 
must be left in the hands of the central authority, and 
the regional authorities must be vested chiefly with 
administrative, political and cultural functions of a 
purely regional nature. These are: education, justice, 
administration, essential political measures, forms and 
methods of application of the general decrees in adaptation 
to the national conditions and manner of life‹and 
all this in the language native to and understood by 
the population. Hence the generally recognized type of

J. V. S T A L I N 92 
regional union, headed by a regional Central Executive 
Committee, is the most expedient form of such 
autonomy. 
That is the type of autonomy the necessity of which, 
in the present transitional period, is dictated both by the 
interests of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat 
and by the common struggle of the proletarians 
of all the nations of Russia against bourgeois nationalism, 
that last bulwark of imperialism. 
All this clearly enough defines the tasks of our conference. 
The conference will hear reports from the localities, 
so as to obtain a general idea of the demands 
of the labouring masses of the nationalities of this 
region. It will then trace a rough preliminary chart 
of the territory, the labouring population of which 
will be invited to take part in electing a regional 
constituent congress of Soviets, the right to elect being 
granted to the labouring masses organized in the Soviets 
not only of the given autonomous territory, but also 
of the adjacent districts. Lastly, the conference will 
elect a commission, which will be entrusted with the convening 
of the regional constituent congress of Soviets. 
It will be left to this constituent congress to decide the 
question of autonomy, to define the jurisdiction of the 
autonomous government, and definitely to fix the frontiers 
of the region. 
Such are the tasks of this conference. 
In opening the conference, I wish to express the assurance 
that it will accomplish its task with credit.

SPEECHES DELIVERED AT A CONFERENCE, MAY 10-16, 1918 93 
2. SPEECH AT THE CLOSING 
OF THE CONFERENCE 
May 16 
Permit me to say on behalf of the central Soviet 
power that the Council of People¹s Commissars has 
always regarded it as its sacred duty to meet the 
aspirations of the movement for emancipation of the 
oppressed and exploited masses of the peoples of the 
East, and especially of the Moslem East, the most 
down-trodden of all. The whole character of our revolution, 
the very nature of Soviet power, the entire international 
situation, and lastly even the geographical 
position of Russia, situated as it is between imperialist 
Europe and oppressed Asia, are all factors which undoubtedly 
dictate to the Soviet power a policy of rendering 
fraternal support to the oppressed peoples of the East 
in their struggle for emancipation. 
Of all forms of oppression existing today, national 
oppression is the most subtle and dangerous. Subtle, 
because it serves so conveniently to mask the wolfish 
countenance of the bourgeoisie. Dangerous, because it 
so astutely diverts the lightning from the bourgeoisie 
by stirring up national conflicts. If the European sharks 
succeeded in hurling the workers against one another in 
the world slaughter, and if they have succeeded until now 
in keeping the slaughter going, one of the reasons is that 
the power of the bourgeois nationalism which is befogging 
the minds of the workers of Europe has not yet spent 
itself. Nationalism is the last position from which the 
bourgeoisie must be driven in order to vanquish it completely. 
But nationalism cannot be smashed by disregarding

J. V. S T A L I N 94 
the national question, ignoring and denying its existence, 
as some of our comrades do. Far from it! National nihilism 
only injures the cause of socialism, because it plays 
into the hands of the bourgeois nationalists. In order 
to smash nationalism, it is necessary first of all to tackle 
and solve the national question. But in order to solve 
the national question openly and in a socialist way, 
it must be tackled on Soviet lines and be fully and entirely 
subordinated to the interests of the labouring masses 
organized in Soviets. Thus, and only thus, can the last 
intellectual weapon of the bourgeoisie be struck from its 
hands. The Autonomous Tatar-Bashkir Republic now 
in process of formation is the practical way of solving 
this general problem which is of such importance for 
our entire revolution. May this Autonomous Republic 
serve as a living beacon to the Moslem peoples of the 
East, lighting the path to their emancipation from oppression. 
I hereby close the conference on the convening of a 
constituent congress of Soviets of the Tatar-Bashkir 
Republic, and wish you success in the building of your 
autonomous republic.

ANOTHER LIE 
Nashe Vremya, 17 No. 97 (evening edition), prints 
a dispatch from its own correspondent giving the text 
of a German wireless message from Constantinople which 
alleges that ³the Bolsheviks, having received strong 
reinforcements from Turkestan and Astrakhan, passed 
to the offensive, and, notwithstanding the heroic resistance 
of the Moslems, captured the city of Baku.² 
I publicly declare that this provocative message is 
devoid of all truth. 
Baku recognized the power of the Soviets from the 
first days of the revolution, and recognizes it now. There 
was no Bolshevik attack on Baku, nor could there have 
been. There was merely an adventurist attack of a 
handful of Tatar and Russian landlords and generals, 
who suffered complete fiasco because of the detestation 
in which they are held by the Moslem and Russian 
workers and peasants. There was no fight between Bolsheviks 
and Moslems, nor could there have been. The 
Baku Soviet power was, and remains, the power of the 
workers and peasants of all the nationalities of Baku 
and the Baku area, and, above all, the power of the 
Moslem people.

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 
I 
TRANSCAUCASIA 
The situation in Transcaucasia is growing more and 
more ominous. The declaration of the independence of 
Transcaucasia by the Diet (April 22), which was to have 
untied the hands of the Tiflis ³government,² actually 
threw it into the toils of the international sharks. How 
the so-called ³peace negotiations² in Batum18 will end, 
the immediate future will show. One thing is certain: 
the independence of the Tiflis Mensheviks and their 
government of the Russian revolution will inevitably 
turn into their slavish dependence on the Turkish and 
German ³civilized² wolves. It will be an alliance of 
the Menshevik rulers of Tiflis with the Turkish and 
German imperialists against the Russian revolution. 
Menshevik Chkhenkeli in the role of a future Caucasian 
Golubovich‹isn¹t that truly an edifying picture, 
Messrs. the Martovs and Dans? . . . 
Diet member Karchikyan reports from Tiflis: 
³Tiflis is in a state of unrest; the Armenians have resigned 
from the cabinet, and the workers and peasants are demonstrating 
in the streets against the government for having proclaimed 
Transcaucasia independent. Demonstrations are being held 
in Kutais, Honi, Lechhum, Gori and Dushet demanding a referendum 
on the question of independence.² 
All Armenia is protesting against the usurpers of 
the Tiflis self-styled ³government² and demanding the 
resignation of its deputies from the Diet. And the Moslem

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 97 
centre, Baku, the citadel of Soviet power in Transcaucasia, 
which has rallied around itself all Eastern Transcaucasia 
from Lenkoran and Kuba to Yelizavetpol, is affirming 
with arms in hand the rights of the Transcaucasian 
peoples, who are striving might and main to preserve 
their tie with Soviet Russia. We say nothing of heroic 
Abkhazia,19 on the Black Sea coast, which has unanimously 
risen against the blackguard bands of the Tiflis 
³government² and is repelling their assault on Sukhum 
arms in hand. ³All Abkhazia, young and old, has risen 
against the band of two thousand invaders from the South, 
and already for eight days has been defending the approaches 
to Sukhum twenty versts south of the city,² we 
are informed by Chairman of the Revolutionary Military 
Committee Eshba. Some reports say that the advance 
of the Transcaucasian detachments is being supported 
from the sea by a flotilla of armed transports and a group 
of destroyers. Furthermore, it appears that under the 
Brest-Litovsk Peace, and according to the Germans¹ 
interpretation, not only must we not advance from the 
sea to protect Sukhum, but we have not even the right 
to defend ourselves. Such is the real support rendered 
by the German ³peacemakers² to the Transcaucasian 
aggressors. This being so, it is not difficult to understand 
that the fate of Sukhum is practically decided in advance. 
The population of Transcaucasia is opposed to the Tiflis 
³government.² The population of Transcaucasia is opposed 
to secession from Russia. The workers and peasants of 
Transcaucasia are in favour of a referendum, notwithstanding 
the handful of Diet members, because nobody, 
positively nobody, has authorized the Diet to sever 
Transcaucasia from Russia.

J. V. S T A L I N 98 
Such is the picture. 
No wonder the more shamefaced of the Mensheviks‹ 
Jordania, Tsereteli and even (even!) Gegechkori‹have 
washed their hands of the matter and are leaving the 
filthy work to the more unscrupulous of the Mensheviks. 
We are informed from Tiflis that when Kars was 
surrendered by the Armenians, the Turkish corps commander 
at Kars declared that he considered the dispatch 
of Turkish forces to occupy Baku and save the Moslems 
in the Baku area inevitable, if the Transcaucasian government 
itself did not succeed soon in doing so. Parallel 
with this, ³it was given to be understood that this was 
inevitable in a letter from Wehib Pasha to the Prime 
Minister of the Transcaucasian government.² 
We have no documentary verification of these reports, 
but one thing is certain, namely, that if the Turkish 
³saviours² do advance on Baku, they will encounter 
strong resistance from the mass of the population, 
and from the Moslem workers and peasants in the first 
place. 
Needless to say, the Soviet Government will exert 
every effort to protect the inalienable rights of the labouring 
masses of Transcaucasia against the encroachments 
of the invader. 
II 
THE NORTH CAUCASUS 
In 1917 a handful of retired North Caucasian generals 
of the type of Filimonov, Karaulov, Chermoyev 
and Bammatov proclaimed themselves a Federation of 
Highlanders, named themselves the government of the

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 99 
North Caucasus from the Black Sea to the Caspian, and 
surreptitiously prepared to take action in conjunction 
with Kaledin. In November 1917, after the victory of 
Soviet power in the centre of Russia, this pseudo-government 
coquetted with the British and French Military 
Missions, trying to undermine the truce on the Russo- 
German Front. In the early part of 1918, after the collapse 
of the Kaledin adventure, this mysterious ³government² 
disappeared from the political scene and confined itself 
to organizing bandit attacks on trains and treacherous 
assaults on civilian inhabitants of towns and villages. 
By the spring of this year everyone had forgotten it, 
because genuine Soviets of people¹s deputies had firmly 
established themselves in the North Caucasus, in the 
Kuban and Terek regions, and had rallied around themselves 
broad sections of all the North Caucasian races 
and peoples without exception. Kabardinians and Cossacks, 
Ossetians and Georgians, Russians and Ukrainians 
rallied in a broad ring around the Terek Soviet; Chechens 
and Ingushes, Cossacks and Ukrainians, workers and peasants, 
filled the numerous Soviets of the Kuban region 
with their representatives. At their congresses, the 
broad labouring sections of all these races and peoples 
publicly proclaimed their indissoluble tie with Soviet 
Russia. All this could not but compel the self-styled 
³government² of the Chermoyevs and Bammatovs to 
slink from the political stage. Everybody considered 
this astonishing ³government² dead and buried. True, 
in March of this year a close friend of the Bammatovs, 
the so-called Imam of Daghestan, made his existence 
known by organizing bandit raids on the railway at 
Petrovsk and Derbent. But already in mid-April the

J. V. S T A L I N 100 
Imam¹s adventure was liquidated by Soviet detachments 
of Baku workers and by the Daghestanians themselves, 
who drove the Imam and his suite of Russian officers 
into the Daghestanian mountains. 
But imperialism would not be imperialism if it were 
not able to call up the shades of the dead from the 
³other world² in furtherance of its own purposes in this 
world. Only a week ago we were handed an official 
statement signed by Chermoyev and Bammatov, who 
have risen from the dead, announcing the formation 
of an independent (don¹t laugh!) North Caucasian state 
stretching from the Black Sea to the Caspian (nothing 
more, nor less!). 
³The Federation of Caucasian Highlanders,² the proclamation 
of this self-styled government reads, ³has resolved to: 
secede from Russia and form an independent state.² 
³The boundaries of the new state will be: in the North‹ 
the geographical borders which the Daghestan, Terek, Stavropol, 
Kuban and Black Sea regions and provinces possessed in the 
former Russian Empire; in the West‹the Black Sea; in the 
East‹the Caspian Sea; in the South‹a border, the details of 
which will be determined in agreement with the government 
of Transcaucasia.² 
Thus, the Transcaucasian ³government² is establishing 
³relations² with the Turkish and German ³liberators,² 
and the North Caucasian ³government² with 
the Transcaucasian. It is all perfectly clear. The North 
Caucasian adventurers, having become disillusioned 
with the British and French, are now reckoning on the 
latter¹s enemies. And since there is no limit to the Turks¹ 
and Germans¹ lust for conquest, it is to be presumed 
that the possibility is not excluded of an ³agreement²

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 101 
between the North Caucasian adventure-seekers and the 
Turkish and German ³liberators.² 
We have no doubt that the latter will give assurances 
of their fidelity to the German treaty, of their readiness 
to maintain friendly relations and so forth. But since 
it is deeds, not words, that are believed nowadays, and 
the deeds of these gentry are all too definite, the Soviet 
Government will have to mobilize all its forces to protect 
the peoples of the North Caucasus from possible 
attempts at conquest.

CONCERNING THE SITUATION 
IN THE CAUCASUS 
From the People¹s Commissariat 
for the Affairs of Nationalities 
A report appeared in the Sunday newspapers stating 
that Baku and the Apsheron Peninsula had been captured 
by the British. It reads: 
³May 24. The Odessa newspapers report that persons arriving 
from Baku say that three weeks ago motor-borne British troops 
entered the city, having penetrated to the Caucasus from Mesopotamia, 
via Persia. The detachment is a large one and evidently 
constitutes a vanguard. Some say that the British are establishing 
contact with Kornilov¹s detachments. Another newspaper reports 
that the British have occupied the Apsheron Peninsula and Baku 
and are advancing from there in the direction of Tiflis, Alexandropol, 
Sarikamysh, Kars and Erzerum.² 
The People¹s Commissariat for the Affairs of Nationalities 
deems it necessary to state that this provocative 
report, which moreover comes from the most mysterious 
sources, has no basis in fact. No British detachments have 
appeared, or could have appeared, in Baku, if only because 
the entire Baku Gubernia and all Eastern Transcaucasia are 
guarded by Soviet troops, who at the first signal are 
prepared to give battle to any external force, no matter 
in what guise it may appear. A report from Commissar 
Extraordinary Shaumyan of May 25 states that ³Baku and

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 103 
the Baku area are not menaced at present from any 
quarter, if we do not count the Tatar landlords, who the 
other day executed a raid on Ajikabul and were hurled 
back far to the west by Soviet units² 
As to the situation in South Transcaucasia, that area 
really is menaced; not on the part of the British, however, 
but on the part of the Turks, who are advancing along 
the Alexandropol-Djulfa railway towards Tabriz, ³in order 
to repulse the British in North Persia.² 
Here is what Karchikyan, member of the Transcaucasian 
Diet, reports in this connection on May 20: 
³On May 13, in Batum, Turkey presented a demand insisting 
that Turkish troops be allowed to advance into Persia by the 
Alexandropol-Djulfa railway, on the grounds that the British are 
pressing from the direction of Mosul and the Turks are under the 
necessity of occupying North Persia without delay. The Turks 
are backing their demand with force. On the morning of the 15th 
they began to bombard Alexandropol. Taken by surprise, our 
troops were unable to check the advance, and surrendered Alexandropol 
on the 16th. On the 17th, the Turks demanded free 
passage for their troops to Djulfa, promising not to molest the 
population. Otherwise, they threatened, they would force their 
way through. In view of the fact that the Alexandropol retreat 
had thrown our troops into complete disarray, and that in the 
event of resistance being offered the whole population of the 
Surmalinsky and Echmiadzinsky uyezds would be put to a terrible 
ordeal, we were compelled to agree to the Turks¹ demand. The 
inhabitants of the Alexandropol Uyezd have left to a man and 
have assembled in the Bambak-Lori area. Similarly the inhabitants 
of the Surmalinsky Uyezd. I have received news today that 
the inhabitants of the Akhalkalaki Uyezd have also abandoned 
their homes and are moving in the direction of Tsalka. The 
delegation in Batum lodged a protest against the ultimatum, 
but did not make it a casus belli and decided to continue the 
negotiations.²

J. V. S T A L I N 104 
Reporting these facts, the People¹s Commissariat 
for the Affairs of Nationalities feels obliged to state 
that the purpose of the false reports from Odessa is 
evidently to vindicate the Turkish incursion, undertaken 
in defiance of all law with the object of seizing the 
Persian railway.

THE DON AND THE NORTH CAUCASUS 
(Machinations and the Facts) 
At the first meeting of the peace conference in Kiev,20 
the Ukrainian delegation announced that it had statements 
from the Don, North Caucasian and other ³governments,² 
declaring that they had seceded from Russia 
and had established friendly relations with the Ukrainian-
German Government. ³We are not opposed to negotiating 
with representatives of the Soviet Government,² 
Mr. Shelukhin, the Chairman of the Ukrainian delegation, 
said, ³but we should like to know to what regions 
the authority of the Russian Federation extends, 
because I have statements from a number of governments 
(Don, North Caucasian, etc.), declaring that they do 
not wish to remain parts of Russia.² 
Far from remonstrating against this move of the 
Ukrainians, the Turks and Germans, in a number of 
official statements, support the claims of the abovementioned 
semi-legal ³governments,² and seize on them 
as a formal pretext for the ³self-determination² (i.e., seizure) 
of new territories. . . . 
But what are these mysterious ³governments²? Where 
do they come from? 
It is strange, in the first place, that the patron of 
these ³governments² and the official sponsor of this

J. V. S T A L I N 106 
whole campaign should be the Ukrainian Hetman Government, 
which came into being only yesterday by the 
grace . . . not of the people at any rate. By what right 
does the Ukrainian delegation venture to speak in this 
way to the Soviet power, which was freely chosen by 
tens of millions of inhabitants of the Russian Federation, 
and which, moreover, has rallied around itself the 
broad regional Soviets of the Don, Kuban, Black Sea 
and Terek, which were elected by millions of inhabitants 
of these regions? In face of this, what weight can the 
present Ukrainian Government have, which was not only 
not elected by the people, but is not even backed by a 
stage-managed Diet elected on a limited suffrage, in 
the nature, at least, of a Landtag representing the 
upper classes? Furthermore, it may be taken for granted 
that if the peace conference were taking place not in 
Kiev, but somewhere in neutral territory, the recently 
overthrown Ukrainian Rada would not fail to come forward 
and declare that a treaty with the Hetman Government 
cannot be binding on the Ukrainian people, who do not 
recognize this government. Two questions would then 
arise: 1) whose credentials in such a case should be 
recognized as the more valid, those of the Hetman 
Government, or those of the Ukrainian Rada? and 2) what 
could the present Ukrainian delegation, which sets such 
high value on ³declarations² of every kind, say in its 
own vindication? . . . 
It is no less strange, in the second place, that Germany, 
which supports the statement of the Ukrainian 
delegation and is assiduously coquetting with the adventurist 
³governments² of the Don and the North Caucasus 
in the interests of ³self-determination,² has not a single

THE DON AND THE NORTH CAUCASUS 107 
word to say about the self-determination of Polish 
Poznan, Danish Schleswig-Holstein, or French Alsace- 
Lorraine. Need it be shown that, in comparison with 
the mass protests of the Danes, Poles and French in 
those regions, the adventurist declarations of the hastily 
concocted ³governments² of South Russia whom nobody 
recognizes lose all weight, all value, and all semblance 
of decency? . . . 
But all this is a ³trifle.² Let us pass to the main 
thing. 
Well, then, how did these mythical South Russian 
³governments² originate? 
³On October 21, 1917, in Vladikavkaz²‹the Don ³government² 
says in its ³Note²‹³a treaty was signed establishing a new 
federal state, the South-Eastern Federation, comprising the population 
of the territories of the Don, Kuban and Astrakhan Cossack 
troops, the highlanders of the North Caucasus and the Black 
Sea coast, and the free peoples of South-East Russia.² 
We find almost the same thing said in a wireless 
message from the representatives of the North Caucasian 
³government,² Chermoyev and Bammatov, delivered to 
us on May 16: 
³The peoples of the Caucasus lawfully elected a National 
Assembly, which, meeting in May and September 1917, proclaimed 
the establishment of a Federation of Caucasian Highlanders.² 
And further: ³The Federation of Caucasian Highlanders has resolved 
to secede from Russia and form an independent state, whose 
boundaries will be: in the North‹the geographical borders which 
the Daghestan, Terek, Stavropol, Kuban and Black Sea regions 
and provinces possessed in the former Russian Empire; in the 
West‹the Black Sea; in the East‹the Caspian Sea.² 
It thus appears that on the eve of the victory of 
the October Revolution, which overthrew the Kerensky

J. V. S T A L I N 108 
Government, groups of adventurers linked with that 
Government gathered in Vladikavkaz and, without even 
taking the trouble to ask the consent of the population, 
proclaimed that they were ³authorized² governments, and 
that the South of Russia had seceded from Russia. Of 
course, in a free country like Russia no one is debarred 
from indulging in separatist dreams, and i t will be 
readily admitted that the Soviet power could not, and 
was not obliged to, rush to follow the adventurist 
declarations of dreamers who had no link whatever with 
the peoples of South Russia. We have no doubt that if 
Germany were to grant the citizens the same liberty as 
that now enjoyed in Russia, then Poznan, Alsace-Lorraine, 
Poland, Courland, Estland, etc., would be covered by 
a network of national governments which would have 
far weightier grounds for calling themselves governments 
than the Bogayevskys, Krasnovs, Bammatovs and Chermoyevs 
who have been expelled by their own peoples 
and are now in exile. . . . 
Such is the story of the origin of the mythical ³governments² 
of South Russia. 
The ³Note² of the Don ³government² and Chermoyev¹s 
wireless message refer to the past, to September 
and October 1917, and to Vladikavkaz, as the refuge 
of the retired generals. But nearly a year has passed 
since then. In the interval Don, Kuban-Black Sea and 
Terek Regional People¹s Soviets have been formed, 
which unite around themselves millions of the population: 
Cossacks and inogorodnie,* Abkhazians and Russians, 
* The name given by the Cossacks to all those residing in 
the Cossack regions but not belonging to the Cossack order.‹Tr.

THE DON AND THE NORTH CAUCASUS 109 
Chechens and Ingushes, Ossetians and Kabardinians, 
Georgians and Armenians. The inhabitants of these 
regions recognized the Soviet power long ago and 
widely exercise the right to self-determination granted 
them. As to Vladikavkaz, the former residence of the 
Karaulovs, Bogayevskys, Chermoyevs and Bammatovs, 
it has long ago proclaimed itself the seat of the Terek 
People¹s Soviet. What value, then, can the fossil generals 
and their adventurist declarations of the summer of 
1917 have in face of these generally known facts? In 
September and October the Kerensky Government still 
existed in Russia and was fulminating against the 
Bolshevik Party, which had then been driven underground, 
but which is now in power. If September and 
October 1917 are of such sacramental significance to 
the Ukrainian delegation and the German Government, 
why do they not invite to the peace conference the 
remnants of the Kerensky Government, which was then 
still extant, as they are now inviting the remnants 
of the ³government² of the Chermoyevs and Karaulovs, 
who were also extant in September and October 
1917? 
Or again: in what way exactly is September 1917 
preferable to April 1918, when the Ukrainian Rada, 
which was about to send a delegation for negotiations 
with the Soviet Government, was hurled in one instant 
into political oblivion ³on the basis² of the German 
³interpretation² of the principle of self-determination 
of nations? . . . 
Or, lastly: why is the declaration of Cossack General 
Krasnov, who has been expelled by the Cossacks, and 
who towards the end of 1917 was taken prisoner by

J. V. S T A L I N 110 
the Soviet troops at Gatchina and then released by the 
Soviet Government on parole‹why is his declaration 
considered ³a political act of major importance,² while 
the declaration, for example, of the Crimean Council 
of People¹s Commissars, which had rallied around itself 
hundreds of thousands of Russian and Tatar inhabitants, 
and which thrice proclaimed by radio the indissolubility 
of the tie between the Crimea and the Russian Federation, 
is considered of no political importance? 
Why does General Krasnov, who has been expelled 
by the Cossacks, enjoy the special patronage of the 
Ukrainian-German rulers, while the members of the 
Crimean Council of People¹s Commissars, which was 
freely elected by the population, have bean savagely 
shot? . . . 
Obviously, the point here is not whether the ³declarations² 
are genuine or not, nor whether these ³declarations² 
are supported by the masses. Nor, still less, 
is it the interpretation of ³self-determination,² which 
is being barbarously defiled and distorted by official 
bandits. The point simply is that the ³declarations² are 
highly useful to the Ukrainian-German lovers of imperialist 
machinations, because they are a convenient 
camouflage for their efforts to seize and enslave new 
territories. 
It is significant that of a whole series of delegations 
from the so-called Don government, delegations just as 
³lawful² as General Krasnov¹s, the Ukrainian-Germans 
selected the latter, because none of the others adhered to 
the German ³orientation.² Moreover, the fictitiousness 
and unreality of the Krasnov-Bogayevsky ³government² 
is so obvious, that a number of Ministers appointed by

THE DON AND THE NORTH CAUCASUS 111 
Krasnov (Paramonov, Minister of Education, and Semyonov, 
Minister of Agriculture) offically declined on 
the ground that they ³had been appointed Ministers by 
General Krasnov in their absence.² But the Ukrainian- 
German self-determinators are evidently not in the least 
put out by this, because Krasnov is a very convenient 
screen for them. 
It is no less significant that the so-called South- 
Eastern Federation, which went to its eternal rest in 
January, suddenly returned to life in May somewhere in 
the Ukraine, or even in Constantinople, and, what is 
more, not all the peoples of the North Caucasus yet 
know that the ³governments² which they had buried 
long ago continue to ³exist² illegally, perhaps in Constantinople, 
or maybe in Kiev, from where they intend 
to enact laws for them. The Ukrainian-German selfdeterminators 
are evidently not put out by this ingenuous 
machination either, since they can make capital out of it. 
Such are the ³affairs² of the power-lusting South 
Russian adventurers, on the one hand, and the political 
machinators, on the other. 
But what is the attitude towards independence of 
the peoples of South Russia themselves, in whose name 
Messrs. the self-determinators pretend to be acting? 
Let us begin with the Don. Already since February 
there exists an autonomous Don Soviet Republic, which 
is uniting around itself the overwhelming majority of the 
population of the region. It is no secret to anybody that 
the regional congress held in April and attended by 
more than 700 delegates, publicly confirmed the indissolubility 
of the tie with Russia, of which the Don Republic 
constitutes an autonomous part.

J. V. S T A L I N 112 
Here is what the Central Executive Committee of 
the Don Republic had to say of the claims of the newbaked 
Krasnov-Bogayevsky ³government² in its resolution 
of May 28: 
³The Central Executive Committee of the Don Soviet Republic 
desires to inform the Council of People¹s Commissars and 
the peace conference in Kiev that there is no governmental authority 
in the Don except the Central Executive Committee and its 
Presidium. Any other persons who have proclaimed or may proclaim 
themselves the government are state criminals, who will be 
committed to trial by a people¹s court for high treason. We have 
been informed that a delegation has appeared at the peace 
conference which professes to represent the Don government. We, 
as the state power, apprise the Council of People¹s Commissars and 
the peace conference in Kiev that no delegates who are not furnished 
with credentials from the Soviet Government of the Don 
Republic should be allowed to take part in the peace negotiations, 
and if any such should have appeared, we declare that they are 
usurpers and impostors, who will be committed to trial as state 
criminals. The Central Executive Committee insists that this 
bogus delegation from the ŒDon government¹ be ejected from the 
peace conference, since it is unlawful and must not be allowed 
to take part in the peace negotiations. 
³Chairman, Central Executive Committee, V. Kovalyov 
³Secretary, V. Puzhilev 
³(Adopted May 28) Tsaritsyn.² 
Let us pass now to the Kuban. Everyone knows that 
there is a Kuban-Black Sea Autonomous Soviet Republic 
which unites around itself 90 per cent of the population 
of all the departments and districts of the region without 
exception. 
Everyone knows that in April of this year a largely 
attended congress of the Kuban-Black Sea region, in

THE DON AND THE NORTH CAUCASUS 113 
which Chechens and Ingushes took part, and at which 
Y. Poluyan, a Cossack, presided, solemnly confirmed the 
indissolubility of the region¹s tie with Russia, and just 
as solemnly outlawed all adventure-seekers of the Filimonov 
and Krasnov type. Incidentally, the fact that 
tens of thousands of Kubanians are now under arms and 
staunchly defending Soviet Russia from Sukhum to 
Bataisk is eloquent testimony enough of the sentiments 
and sympathies of the Kuban and the Black Sea region. 
We say nothing of the fleet, whose destruction the benefactors 
of the Krasnovs and Filimonovs are awaiting 
so impatiently. . . . 
Lastly, the Terek region. It is no secret to anyone 
that there is a Terek Regional People¹s Soviet which 
unites around itself all, or practically all (95 per cent), 
of the auls, stanitsas, villages and hamlets, to say nothing 
of the towns. At the first regional congress in January of 
this year, all the delegates without exception declared 
themselves in favour of the Soviet power and the indissolubility 
of the tie with Russia. The second congress, 
held in April, which was still broader and more 
numerously attended than the first, solemnly confirmed 
the tie with Russia and proclaimed the region an Autonomous 
Soviet Republic of the Russian Federation. The 
third regional congress, now in progress, is going a step 
further and passing from word to deed, calling upon the 
citizens to take up arms in defence of the Terek, and 
not only the Terek, against the encroachments of uninvited 
guests. The so-called Note of the so-called Don 
government talks a great deal about the ³free peoples 
of the South-East,² who, it alleges, are anxious to secede 
from Russia. Believing that facts are the best refutation

J. V. S T A L I N 114 
of ³declarations,² we shall let the facts speak for themselves. 
Let us first hear the resolution of the Terek People¹s 
Soviet: 
³The Terek People¹s Soviet learns from telegraphic dispatches 
that alleged delegates from the North Caucasus now in 
Constantinople have proclaimed the independence of the North 
Caucasus and have notified this to the imperial Turkish Government 
and other powers. 
³The Terek People¹s Soviet, comprising the Chechen, Kabardinian, 
Ossetian, Ingush, Cossack and inogorodnie groups, affirms 
that the peoples of the Terek region have never delegated anyone 
anywhere for the above-mentioned purpose, and that if any individuals 
now in Constantinople pretend to be delegates of the 
peoples of the Terek region and act in the name of these peoples, 
they are nothing but impostors and adventurers. 
³The Terek People¹s Soviet expresses its astonishment at 
the political shortsightedness and naïveté of the Turkish Government 
in allowing itself to be imposed upon by swindlers. 
³The Terek People¹s Soviet, comprising the above-mentioned 
groups, declares that the peoples of the Terek region constitute 
an inalienable part of the Russian Federative Republic. 
³The Terek People¹s Soviet protests against the action 
of the Transcaucasian government in associating the North 
Caucasus with the proclamation of independence of Transcaucasia² 
(see Narodnaya Vlast, organ of the Terek People¹s 
Soviet). 
(Resolution adopted unanimously. May 9.) 
And now let the Chechens and Ingushes, who are 
being calumniated by the usurpers and their patrons, 
have their say. Here is a resolution of their group, representing 
all, or nearly all, the Ingushes and Chechens: 
³This special meeting of the Chechen-Ingush group of the 
Terek People¹s Soviet, having considered the report that the 
North Caucasus has been proclaimed independent, unanimously

THE DON AND THE NORTH CAUCASUS 115 
adopts the following resolution: Declaration of the independence 
of the North Caucasus is an act of extreme importance which can 
be made only with the knowledge and consent of the entire population 
concerned. 
³The Chechen-Ingush group affirms that the Chechen-Ingush 
people have not sent any delegates to conduct negotiations of any 
kind with the Ottoman delegation in Trapezund or with the Ottoman 
Government in Constantinople, and that the question of independence 
was never discussed in any body or assembly expressing 
the will of the Chechen-Ingush people. 
³Consequently, the Chechen-Ingush group regards the persons 
who have the impudence to speak in the name of the people, 
who did not elect them, as impostors and enemies of the people. 
³The Chechen-Ingush group declares that the only salvation 
for all the North Caucasian highlanders and for the liberties won 
by the revolution lies in close unity with the Russian revolutionary 
democracy. 
³This is dictated not only by their innate love of liberty, but 
also by those economic relations which in the last decades have 
closely cemented the North Caucasus and Central Russia into 
one inseparable whole.² 
(Adopted May 9. See Narodnaya Vlast, organ of the Terek 
People¹s Soviet.) 
And here is an excerpt from a fiery speech delivered 
by Comrade Sheripov, a representative of the Ingushes 
and Chechens, at the meeting of the Terek People¹s Soviet, 
an excerpt explicit enough to put a stop to all insinuations 
against the Daghestanians: 
³Thanks to the great Russian revolution, we have received 
that fair and lovely liberty for which our ancestors fought for 
centuries and, vanquished, threw themselves on the bayonet¹s 
point. Now that we have received a guarantee of the right to selfdetermination, 
the people will never surrender this right to anyone. 
Today we hear talk of the independence of the North Caucasus 
coming from the lips of landlords, princes, provocateurs and spies 
and all against whom Shamiel waged a mortal struggle for fifty

J. V. S T A L I N 116 
years. Attempts are being made by these enemies of the people 
to declare the independence of the Caucasus and proclaim it an 
Imamate. But let me tell you that Shamiel cut off the heads of 
the ancestors of these princes, and that is how he would act now. 
Our group, which represents the Ingush and Chechen people, 
expressed its opinion on the declaration of independence of the 
North Caucasus in the resolution it adopted at its special sitting.² 
(See above. Reproduced from Narodnaya Vlast.) 
Such are the facts. 
Is all this known to the German-Ukrainian-Turkish 
self-determinators? Of course! Because the regional 
Soviets of South Russia act quite openly, in the eyes 
of all, and the agents of these gentry read our newspapers 
attentively enough not to miss generally known 
facts. 
What, then, is the purpose of the above-mentioned 
statement of the Ukrainian delegation concerning the 
mythical ³governments,² a statement which the Germans 
and Turks are supporting by word and deed? 
Only one, namely: to use these bogus ³governments² 
as a screen for the seizure and enslavement of new territories. 
The Germans used the Ukrainian Rada as a camouflage 
when they advanced ³on the basis of the Brest 
treaty² (oh, of course!) and occupied the Ukraine. But 
now, apparently, the Ukraine can no longer serve 
as a screen and camouflage, yet the Germans need to 
make another advance. Hence the demand for a new 
camouflage, a new screen. And since demand creates 
supply, the Krasnovs and Bogayevskys, the Chermoyevs 
and Bammatovs were not slow in coming forward and offering 
their services. And it is not at all improbable that 
in the near future the Krasnovs and Bogayevskys, directed 
and supplied by the Germans, will advance against

THE DON AND THE NORTH CAUCASUS 117 
Russia, for the ³liberation² of the Don, while the Germans 
once again vow and swear their fidelity to the 
Brest treaty. The same must be said of the Kuban, 
Terek, etc. 
That is the whole point! 
The Soviet Government would be burying itself 
alive if it did not muster every ounce of its strength to 
resist the invaders and enslavers. 
And that is what it will do.

TELEGRAM TO V. I. LENIN 
Arrived in Tsaritsyn on the 6th.21 Despite the confusion 
in every sphere of economic life, order can be established. 
In Tsaritsyn, Astrakhan and Saratov the grain monopoly 
and fixed prices were abolished by the Soviets, 
and there is chaos and profiteering. Have secured the 
introduction of rationing and fixed prices in Tsaritsyn. 
The same must be done in Astrakhan and Saratov, 
otherwise all grain will flow away through these profiteering 
channels. Let the Central Executive Committee 
and the Council of People¹s Commissars also demand 
that these Soviets put a stop to profiteering. 
Rail transport is completely dislocated owing to 
the efforts of the multiplicity of collegiums and revolutionary 
committees. I have been obliged to appoint 
special commissars; they are already establishing order 
despite the protests of the collegiums. The commissars 
are discovering heaps of locomotives in places where 
the collegiums did not suspect their existence. Investigation 
has shown that eight or more through trains 
a day can be sent by the Tsaritsyn-Povorino-Balashov-
Kozlov-Ryazan-Moscow line. Am now accumulating 
trains in Tsaritsyn. Within a week we shall proclaim a

TELEGRAM TO V. I. LENIN 119 
³Grain Week² and shall dispatch to Moscow right away 
about one million poods with a special escort of railwaymen, 
of which I shall give you due notice. 
The hold-up in river transport is due to the fact 
that Nizhni-Novgorod has not been sending steamers, 
presumably because of the Czechoslovaks. Give orders 
that steamers be sent to Tsaritsyn immediately. 
We have information that in the Kuban, in Stavropol, 
there are fully reliable purchasing agents who are busy 
getting out the grain from the South. A line is already 
being laid from Kizlyar to the sea; the Hasav Yurt- 
Petrovsk line has not yet been restored. Let us have 
Shlyapnikov, civil engineers, intelligent workmen, also 
locomotive crews. 
Have sent a messenger to Baku, and shall be leaving 
for the South myself in a day or two. Chief Trade Agent 
Zaitsev will be arrested today for bag-trading and speculating 
in government goods. Tell Schmidt not to send 
any more scoundrels. Let Kobozev see to it that the 
five-man collegium in Voronezh22 in its own interests 
does not create difficulties for my agents. 
It is reported that Bataisk has been captured by the 
Germans.

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 
To Comrade Lenin. 
I am hurrying to the front, and writing only on 
business. 
1) The railway south of Tsaritsyn has not yet been 
restored. I am firing or telling off all who deserve it, 
and I hope we shall have it restored soon. You may 
rest assured that we shall spare nobody, neither ourselves 
nor others, and shall deliver the grain in spite 
of everything. If our military ³experts² (bunglers!) had 
not been asleep or loafing about the line would not 
have been cut, and if the line is restored it will not 
be thanks to, but in spite of, the military. 
2) Large quantities of grain have accumulated on 
rail south of Tsaritsyn. As soon as the line is cleared 
we shall be sending you grain by through trains. 
3) I Have received your communication.23 Everything 
will be done to forestall possible surprises. You may 
rest assured that our hand will not flinch. . . . 
4) I have sent a letter by messenger to Baku.24 
5) Things in Turkestan are bad; Britain is operating 
through Afghanistan. Give somebody (or me) special 
authority (military) to take urgent measures in South 
Russia before it is too late.

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 121 
Because of the bad communications between the 
border regions and the centre someone with broad powers 
is needed here on the spot so that urgent measures can 
be taken promptly. If you appoint someone (whoever it is) 
for this purpose, let us know by direct wire, and send 
his credentials also by direct wire, otherwise we risk 
having another Murmansk.25 
I send you a telegraphic tape on Turkestan. 
That is all for the present. 
Yours,

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 
Comrade Lenin, 
Just a few words. 
1) If Trotsky is going to hand out credentials right 
and left without thinking‹to Trifonov (Don region), 
to Avtonomov (Kuban region), to Koppe (Stavropol), 
to members of the French Mission (who deserve to be 
arrested), etc.‹it may be safely said that within a month 
everything here in the North Caucasus will go to 
pieces, and we shall lose this region altogether. Trotsky is 
behaving in the way Antonov did at one time. Knock it 
into his head that he must make no appointments without 
the knowledge of the local people, otherwise the 
result will be to discredit the Soviet power. 
2) If you don¹t let us have aeroplanes and airmen, 
armoured cars and 6-inch guns, the Tsaritsyn Front cannot 
hold out and the railway will be lost for a long 
time. 
3) There is plenty of grain in the South, but to get 
it we need a smoothly-working machine which does 
not meet with obstacles from troop trains, army commanders 
and so on. More, the military must assist the 
food agents. The food question is naturally bound up

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 123 
with the military question. For the good of the work, I 
need military powers. I have already written about this, 
but have had no reply. Very well, in that case I shall 
myself, without any formalities, dismiss army commanders 
and commissars who are ruining the work. The interests 
of the work dictate this, and, of course, not having 
a paper from Trotsky is not going to deter me. 
J. Stalin 
Tsaritsyn, 
July 10, 1918 
Published for the first time

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 
The situation in the South is no easy one. The Military 
Council inherited a state of utter disruption, caused 
partly by the inertness of the former commander, and 
partly by a conspiracy on the part of persons appointed 
by him to the various divisions of the Military 
Area. Everything had to be started afresh: we got the 
supply services properly organized, instituted an operations 
division, established contact with all sectors of 
the front, rescinded the old and, in my opinion, criminal 
orders, and only after this launched an offensive 
on Kalach and southward towards Tikhoretskaya. We 
launched the offensive in the hope that Mironov¹s and 
Kikvidze¹s sectors in the North, including the Povorino 
sector, were securely guaranteed against defeat. But it 
turned out that these sectors were the weakest and the 
least secure. You know of the retreat of Mironov and 
the others to the North-East, of the capture of the 
whole railway line from Lipki to Alexikovo by the Cossacks, 
and of the dispatch of Cossack guerilla groups to 
the Volga and their attempts to cut communication along 
the Volga between Kamyshin and Tsaritsyn. 
Furthermore, the Rostov Front and Kalnin¹s groups 
generally lost their stamina owing to lack of shells and 
cartridges and have surrendered Tikhoretskaya and Tor

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 125 
govaya, and are apparently in process of complete disintegration 
(I say ³apparently,² because we have still 
been unable to receive accurate information about the 
Kalnin group). 
I say nothing about the critical position of Kizlyar, 
Bryanskoye and Baku. The pro-British orientation 
is definitely discredited, but the situation on that front 
is anything but favourable. Kizlyar, Prokhladnaya, 
Novo-Georgievskoye and Stavropol are in the hands of 
Cossack insurgents. Only Bryanskoye, Petrovsk, Mineralniye 
Vody, Vladikavkaz, Pyatigorsk and, I believe, 
Yekaterinodar are still holding out. 
Thus, a situation has been created in which communications 
with the food areas of the South have been severed, 
and the Tsaritsyn area itself, which connects the 
centre with the North Caucasus, has in its turn been 
cut off, or practically cut off, from the centre. 
It was in view of this that we decided to call off the 
offensive in the direction of Tikhoretskaya, to take up 
a defensive position, withdraw the combat units from 
the Tsaritsyn Front and from them form a northern 
striking force of about six thousand men, and direct 
them along the left bank of the Don as far as the Khoper 
River. The aim of this move is to clear the Tsaritsyn- 
Povorino line, turn the enemy¹s flank, disorganize him 
and hurl him back. We have every reason to believe 
that we shall be able to execute this plan in the very 
near future. 
The unfavourable situation described above is to be 
attributed: 
1) To the fact that the front-line soldier, the ³competent 
muzhik,² who in October fought for the Soviet

J. V. S T A L I N 126 
power, has now turned against it (he heartily detests 
the grain monopoly, the fixed prices, the requisitions 
and the measures against bag-trading). 
2) To the Cossack make-up of Mironov¹s troops (the 
Cossack units which call themselves Soviet are unable 
and unwilling to wage a resolute fight against the Cossack 
counter-revolutionaries; the Cossacks came over in whole 
regiments to Mironov in order to receive weapons, acquaint 
themselves with the disposition of our forces on 
the spot, and then desert to Krasnov, carrying whole 
regiments along with them; the Cossacks surrounded 
Mironov three times, because they knew every inch of 
his sector, and, of course, utterly routed him). 
3) To the fact that Kikvidze¹s units are built on 
the detachment principle, which makes liaison and coordinated 
action impossible. 
4) To the isolation, because of all these reasons, 
of Sievers¹ forces, which have lost their support on the 
left flank. 
One favourable factor on the Tsaritsyn-Gashun Front 
is the complete elimination of the muddle due to the detachment 
principle, and the timely removal of the socalled 
experts (staunch supporters either of the Cossacks 
or of the British and French), which has made it possible 
to win the sympathy of the military units and establish 
iron discipline in them. 
Now that communications with the North Caucasus 
have been cut, the position as regards food has become hopeless. 
Over seven hundred wagon-loads are standing on rail 
in the North Caucasus, and over a million and a half 
poods are ready for dispatch, but it is quite impossible to 
get the freight out because of the interruption of com

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 127 
munications both by rail and by sea (Kizlyar and Bryanskoye 
are no longer in our hands). There is quite a lot 
of grain in the Tsaritsyn, Kotelnikovo and Gashun districts, 
but it has to be harvested, and Chokprod26 is 
not adapted for this work, and has been unable to adapt 
itself to this day. The crop must be gathered and hay 
must be pressed and accumulated in one spot, but Chokprod 
has no presses. The grain harvest must be organized 
on a large scale, but Chokprod¹s organizers are utterly 
incompetent. The result is that food deliveries are 
in a bad way. 
With the capture of Kalach we secured several tens 
of thousands of poods of grain. I have sent twelve lorries 
to Kalach, and as soon as we can get it to the railway 
I shall send it to Moscow. Good or bad, harvesting 
is proceeding. I hope to secure several tens of thousands 
of poods of grain in the next few days and send it 
to you also. We have more cattle here than we need, 
but there is very little hay, and without hay dispatch 
of cattle in large quantities is impossible. It would 
be well to organize at least one canning factory, establish 
a slaughter-house, etc. But, unfortunately, so far I have 
been unable to find men of knowledge and initiative. 
I ordered the Kotelnikovo agent to arrange for the salting 
of meat on a large scale; the work has begun and there 
are already results, and if the business develops there 
will be enough meat for the winter (40,000 head of cattle 
have accumulated in the Kotelnikovo district alone). 
There is no less cattle in Astrakhan than in Kotelnikovo, 
but the local food commissariat is doing nothing. The representatives 
of the Perishable Foods Procurements Board 
are fast asleep, and it may be confidently prophesied

J. V. S T A L I N 128 
that they will procure no meat. I have sent an agent 
named Zalmayev there to procure meat and fish, but 
I have had no word from him yet. 
The Saratov and Samara gubernias are far more 
promising as far as food is concerned: there is plenty 
of grain there, and I believe Yakubov¹s expedition will 
be able to get out half a million poods or even more. 
In general, it should be said that until communications 
with the North Caucasus are restored, we cannot 
count (very much) on the Tsaritsyn area (as far as food 
is concerned).

The fight is on for the South and the Caspian. In 
order to keep all this area (and we c a n keep it!) we

(ask Artyom about the details). I implore you, break 
down all obstacles and so facilitate the immediate delivery 
of what we request. Baku, Turkestan and the 
North Caucasus will be ours (unquestionably!), if our 
demands are immediately met. 
Things at the front are going well. I have no doubt

completely demoralized).

THE SOUTHERN FRONT 
Izvestia Interview 
Before returning to the Southern Front, People¹s Commissar 
for the Affairs of Nationalities Comrade Stalin gave our 
correspondent his impressions of the situation on the Tsaritsyn 
Front. 
First of all, Comrade Stalin said, two gratifying 
facts should be noted: one is the promotion to administrative 
posts in the rear area of working men with an 
ability not only for agitating in favour of Soviet power, 
but also for building the state on a new, communist 
basis; the second is the appearance of a new corps of 
commanders consisting of officers promoted from the 
ranks who have had practical experience in the imperialist 
war, and who enjoy the full confidence of the Red 
Army men. 
Mobilization is proceeding splendidly, thanks to the 
radical change of sentiment among the population, who 
have realized the necessity of taking up arms against the 
counter-revolutionary bands. 
Firm discipline prevails in all our units. Relations 
between Red Army men and commanders leave nothing 
to be desired. 
What about the food problem in the army?

J. V. S T A L I N 134 
Strictly speaking, we have no such problem in the 
army. Thanks to a well-organized system of supply 
bases, established by the battle sectors themselves, the 
front is experiencing no shortage of food. The daily ration 
of a Red Army man today consists of two pounds 
of bread, and meat, potatoes and cabbage. 
The food supply at the front is entirely in the hands 
of the Army Food Commission of the Supreme Revolutionary 
Military Council of the Republic. It is this Commission 
that has organized the proper supply of the 
units at the front. 
Agitation at the front, Comrade Stalin said, is carried 
on through the newspapers Soldat Revoluztsii28 and 
Borba,29 and through pamphlets, leaflets, etc. The troops 
are cheerful and confident. 
A big defect in the equipment of our army is the 
lack of a standard uniform for the soldiers. It would be 
desirable to design a new uniform as quickly as possible 
and introduce it at the front at once. 
The recent decree of the Central Executive Committee 
introducing incentives for heroic action on the part 
of individual Red Army men and whole units, in the 
shape of special insignia for the former and standards 
for the latter, is a measure of great importance, said 
Comrade Stalin. 
Even before the issue of this decree, he said, units 
which had been awarded revolutionary standards then 
fought like lions. 
As to the state of the enemy units opposing us, ninety 
per cent of their effectives consist of so-called 
inogorodnie, most of them Ukrainians, and volunteer 
officers. The Cossacks constitute no more than ten per

THE SOUTHERN FRONT 135 
cent. The enemy has the advantage of possessing a mobile 
cavalry, which with us is still in embryo. 
I want to remark in conclusion, Comrade Stalin 
said, that whereas our combat units are being welded 
and cemented, the enemy is undergoing complete disintegration.

THE LOGIC OF FACTS 
(In Reference to the ³Theses² 
of the Central Committee of the Mensheviks) 
We have received a document entitled ³Theses and 
Resolution of the Central Committee² of the Menshevik 
Party (October 17-21, 1918). This document sums up the 
activities of the Soviet Government since October 1917 
and formulates certain future prospects which are apparently 
of great moment for the development of the 
Menshevik Party. But the most valuable thing in the 
document is the conclusions it draws, for they refute 
the whole practical activity of the Mensheviks in the 
year of revolution. We consider it necessary here and now 
to give the reader certain of our impressions, postponing 
an analysis of the ³Theses and Resolution² to another 
occasion. 
I 
THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 
Exactly a year ago, the country was languishing in 
the throes of imperialist war and economic disruption. 
The armies at the front, weary and exhausted by suffering, 
were no longer capable of fighting. Meanwhile, 
the British imperialists (Buchanan!) were more and more

THE LOGIC OF FACTS 137 
getting the country into their toils and trying in every 
way to keep it in the imperialist war. Riga had been surrendered30 
and preparations were being made to surrender 
St. Petersburg too, merely in order to prove the necessity 
of the war and of a military dictatorship. The bourgeoisie 
realized all this, and were openly working for 
a military dictatorship and the crushing of the revolution. 
What were the Bolsheviks doing at that time? 
The Bolsheviks were preparing for revolution. They 
considered that the only way out of the blind alley of war 
and economic disruption was for the proletariat to take 
power. They considered that without such a revolution, 
a break with imperialism and the deliverance of 
Russia from its clutches was inconceivable. They convened 
a Congress of Soviets, as the sole heir to power in 
the country. 
First revolution, then peace! 
What were the Mensheviks doing at that time? 
They stigmatized the Bolsheviks¹ ³undertaking² as 
³counter-revolutionary adventurism.² They considered the 
Congress of Soviets unnecessary and tried to prevent its 
convocation, and dubbed the Soviets themselves ³antiquated 
huts² which were doomed to be broken up. 
Instead of these Soviet ³huts,² they proposed a ³permanent 
building² of the ³European² type‹the Preparliament,
31 where they, in conjunction with Milyukov, 
elaborated plans for ³radical agrarian and economic 
reforms.² Instead of a break with imperialism, 
they proposed an Allied conference in Paris as a possible 
way out of the war. To them, a ³consistent peace policy² 
meant the attendance of Menshevik Skobelev at this

J. V. S T A L I N 138 
conference and the dubious efforts of Menshevik Axelrod 
to convene a congress of the Scheidemanns, Renaudels 
and Hyndmans. 
Since then a year has passed. The ³Bolshevik revolution² 
has succeeded in sweeping away the crafty 
machinery of the home and foreign imperialists. For 
Russia, the old imperialist war has become a memory. 
She has thrown off the yoke of imperialism. She is conducting, 
and hopes to continue conducting, an independent 
foreign policy. It is now clear to all that, without 
the October Revolution, Russia would not have extricated 
herself from the blind alley of imperialist war, the 
peasants would not have received land, and the workers 
would not be managing the mills and factories. 
What do the Mensheviks, their Central Committee, 
say now? Listen to them: 
³The Bolshevik revolution of October 1917 was a historical 
necessity, since, by breaking the links between the labouring 
masses and the capitalist classes, it expressed the desire of the 
labouring masses to subordinate the trend of the revolution 
wholly to their own interests, without which the deliverance 
of Russia from the clutches of Allied imperialism, the pursuance 
of a consistent peace policy, the introduction of radical 
agrarian reform, and the regulation by the state of the entire 
economic life in the interests of the masses would have been inconceivable, 
and since this stage of the revolution has had the 
tendency to enlarge also the scope of the influence which the 
Russian revolution had on the course of world developments² (see 
³Theses and Resolution²). 
That is what the Menshevik Central Committee 
says now. 
Incredible, but a fact. The ³Bolshevik revolution 
was,² it appears, ³a historical necessity,² ³without which

THE LOGIC OF FACTS 139 
the deliverance of Russia from the clutches of Allied 
imperialism,² the ³pursuance of a consistent peace policy,² 
the ³introduction of radical agrarian reform² 
and the ³regulation by the state of the entire economic 
life in the interests of the masses² ³would have been 
inconceivable.² 
But that is just what the Bolsheviks affirmed a year 
ago, and what the Menshevik Central Committee opposed 
so fiercely! 
Yes, just that. 
Life, you see, teaches and corrects the most incorrigible. 
It is all-powerful and gets its way in spite of 
everything. . . . 
II 
THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 
Some ten months ago the Constituent Assembly was 
about to meet, and the utterly routed bourgeois counterrevolutionaries 
were again mustering their forces and 
rubbing their hands in glee in anticipation of the ³downfall² 
of Soviet power. The foreign imperialist (Allied) 
press hailed the Constituent Assembly. The Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries were arranging ³private² 
conferences and elaborating a plan for the transfer of 
power from the Soviets to the Constituent Assembly, the 
³master of the land of Russia.² Regeneration of the 
³honest coalition² and correction of the Bolsheviks¹ 
³blunders² loomed in the offing. 
What were the Bolsheviks doing at that time? 
They were continuing the work already begun of 
establishing the power of the proletariat. They considered

J. V. S T A L I N 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
140 
that the ³honest coalition² and its organ, the bourgeois-
democratic Constituent Assembly, were doomed by 
history, because they were aware that a new force had 
appeared on the scene‹the power of the proletariat, 
and a new form of government‹the Republic of Soviets. 
In the early part of 1917 the slogan of a Constituent 
Assembly was a progressive one, and the Bolsheviks 
supported i t . At the end of 1917, after the October 
Revolution, the slogan of a Constituent Assembly became 
reactionary, because it ceased to correspond to the altered 
relative strength of the contending political forces in 
the country. The Bolsheviks considered that in the circumstances 
of the imperialist war in Europe and the victorious 
proletarian revolution in Russia, only two kinds of 
power were conceivable: either a dictatorship of the proletariat, 
in the shape of a Republic of Soviets, or a dictatorship 
of the bourgeoisie, in the shape of a military dictatorship‹
and that any attempt to steer a middle course 
and resurrect the Constituent Assembly would inevitably 
lead to a return to the old, reactionary regime, the liquidation 
of the October conquests. The Bolsheviks had 
no doubt that bourgeois parliamentarism and a bourgeois-
democratic republic represented a past stage of 
the revolution. . . . 
Since then ten months have elapsed. The Constituent 
Assembly, which attempted to put an end to Soviet power, 
was dissolved. The peasants in the country did not even 
notice its dissolution, while the workers acclaimed it 
with jubilation. One section of supporters of the Constituent 
Assembly went to the Ukraine and called in the 
aid of the German imperialists against the Soviets. Another 
section of supporters of the Constituent Assembly

THE LOGIC OF FACTS 141 
went to the Caucasus and found consolation in the arms 
of the Turkish and German imperialists. Still another 
section of supporters of the Constituent Assembly went 
to Samara and, in conjunction with the British and 
French imperialists, waged war on the workers and 
peasants of Russia. The slogan of a Constituent Assembly 
was thus turned into a bait for political simpletons and 
a screen for the fight of the home and foreign counterrevolutionaries 
against the Soviets. 
How did the Mensheviks behave at that time? 
They fought the Soviet power and consistently supported 
the now counter-revolutionary slogan of a Constituent 
Assembly. 
What do the Mensheviks, their Central Committee, 
say now? Listen to them: 
It ³rejects all political collaboration with classes hostile to 
the democracy, and refuses to have any part in government combinations, 
even though hidden behind a democratic flag, that 
are based upon Œcountrywide¹ coalitions of the democracy and the 
capitalist bourgeoisie or upon dependence on foreign imperialism 
and militarism² (see the ³Theses²). 
And further: 
³All attempts by the revolutionary democracy, with the 
backing of the urban non-proletarian masses and the labouring 
masses of the countryside, to re-establish a democratic republic 
by means of an armed struggle against the Soviet Government 
and the masses which support it, have been and are being accompanied, 
owing to the character of the international situation 
and the political immaturity of the Russian democratic petty 
bourgeoisie, by such a re-grouping of social forces as tends to undermine 
the very revolutionary significance itself of the struggle 
for the re-establishment of a democratic system, and involves

J. V. S T A L I N 142 
a direct threat to the fundamental socialist gains of the revolution. 
The desire for agreement with the capitalist classes at 
all costs and for the utilization of foreign weapons in the struggle 
for power deprives the policy of the revolutionary democracy of 
all independence and converts it into a tool of these classes and 
imperialist coalitions² (see ³Theses and Resolution²). 
In a word, coalition is ³rejected² emphatically and 
unreservedly, and the fight for a democratic republic 
and a Constituent Assembly is recognized as counterrevolutionary, 
since it ³involves a direct threat to the 
fundamental socialist gains of the revolution.² 
There can be only one conclusion: Soviet power, the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, is the only conceivable 
revolutionary power in Russia. 
But that is just what the Bolsheviks have been offirming 
all along, and what the Mensheviks were only 
yesterday opposing! 
Yes, just that. 
The logic of facts, you see, is stronger than all 
other logic, the Menshevik not excluded. . . . 
III 
PETTY-BOURGEOIS MUDDLE 
And so: 
It is a fact that after a year of fighting against 
Bolshevik ³adventurism,² the Menshevik Central Committee 
is forced to admit that the ³Bolshevik revolution² 
of October 1917 was a ³historical necessity.² 
It is a fact that after a long fight for a Constituent 
Assembly and an ³honest coalition,² the Menshevik 
Central Committee, although unwillingly and

THE LOGIC OF FACTS 143 
reluctantly, is forced to recognize as unsuitable a ³countrywide² 
coalition and as counter-revolutionary the 
struggle for the ³re-establishment of the democratic 
system² and the Constituent Assembly. 
True, this recognition comes a year late, after the 
counter-revolutionary character of the Constituent Assembly 
slogan and the historical necessity of the October 
Revolution have become commonplace truths‹a 
tardiness utterly unbefitting the Menshevik Central Committee, 
which lays claim to a leading role in the revolution. 
But such is the fate of the Mensheviks: this is 
not the first time they are lagging behind events, and 
not the last time, we presume, that they are parading 
in old Bolshevik breeches. . . . 
It might be thought that after such an admission on 
the part of the Menshevik Central Committee, there 
should be no more room for serious differences. Nor 
would there be, if we were dealing not with the Menshevik 
Central Committee, but with consistent revolutionaries 
capable of thinking things out to their conclusion 
and knowing what follows from what. But the whole 
trouble is that we are dealing here with a party of pettybourgeois 
intellectuals who are for ever vacillating between 
the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between 
revolution and counter-revolution. Hence the inevitable 
contradictions between the word and the deed, the 
perpetual uncertainty and mental waverings. 
Just listen to this! The Menshevik Central Committee, 
you see: 
³Continues to regard popular rule, unlimited democracy, 
as the political form in which alone the social emancipation of 
the proletariat can be worked for and realized. It looks upon

J. V. S T A L I N 144 
a democratic republic, organized by a freely-elected and sovereign 
Constituent Assembly, and upon universal and equal suffrage, 
etc., not only as a means of politically educating the masses and 
uniting the proletariat as a class in support of its own interests, 
a means for which no substitute has been found, but also as 
the only soil on which a socialist proletariat can carry on its 
work of social creation² (see ³Theses and Resolution²). 
Incredible, but a fact. On the one hand, a ³struggle 
for the re-establishment of a democratic system,² it 
appears, ³involves² a ³direct threat to the fundamental 
socialist gains of the revolution,² in view of which 
it is proclaimed counter-revolutionary; on the other, 
the Menshevik Central Committee ³continues² to declare 
itself for the already buried ³sovereign Constituent Assembly²! 
Or perhaps the Menshevik Central Committee 
thinks that a Constituent Assembly can be achieved 
without an ³armed struggle²? But in that case, what 
about the ³historical necessity of the Bolshevik revolution,² 
which discarded the ³sovereign Constituent Assembly²? 
Or further. The Menshevik Central Committee demands 
nothing more nor less than: 
³The abolition of extraordinary agencies of police repression 
and extraordinary tribunals² and ³the cessation of political 
and economic terror² (see ³Theses and Resolution²). 
On the one hand, it recognizes the ³historical necessity² 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat, whose function 
it is to suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie, and, 
on the other, it demands the abolition of certain very 
important instruments of power without which this suppression 
is inconceivable! But in that case, what about the 
gains of the October Revolution, which the bourgeoisie

THE LOGIC OF FACTS 145 
is combating by every means, including the organization 
of terrorist actions and criminal conspiracies? How 
can one recognize the October Revolution as a ³historical 
necessity,² without recognizing the results and 
consequences that inevitably follow from it?! 
Will the Menshevik Central Committee ever extricate 
itself from this involved petty-bourgeois muddle? 
IV 
WHAT NEXT? 
Incidentally, it does try to extricate itself from it. 
Listen to this: 
Standing for the re-establishment of a united and independent 
Russia on the basis of the gains of the revolution won 
by the efforts of the democracy itself, and repudiating, therefore, 
all interference on the part of foreign capitalists in Russia¹s 
domestic affairs,² the Menshevik Party ³is in political solidarity 
with the Soviet Government, inasmuch as the latter stands for 
the liberation of the territory of Russia from occupation, in particular 
foreign occupation, and opposes these attempts of the non-proletarian 
democracy to extend or preserve the area of occupation. 
But this political solidarity in the matter of imperialist intervention 
could lead to direct support of the military actions of the 
Soviet Government for the liberation of the occupied territories 
of Russia only if this Government were to display a real readiness 
to build its relations with the non-Bolshevik democracy in the 
border regions on a basis of mutual agreement, and not of suppression 
and terror² (see ³Theses and Resolution²). 
Thus, instead of fighting the Soviet power‹³agreement² 
with it. 
³Political solidarity with the Soviet Government.² . . . 
We do not know how complete this solidarity is, but

J. V. S T A L I N 146 
need it be said that the Bolsheviks will not object to 
the solidarity of the Menshevik Central Committee with 
the Soviet power? We are fully alive to the difference 
between solidarity with the Soviet Government and 
solidarity, say, with the ³Constituent Assembly² members 
in Samara. 
³Direct support of the military actions of the Soviet 
Government.² . . . We do not know how many troops 
the Menshevik Central Committee could place at the 
disposal of the Soviet power, what military forces it 
could contribute to the Soviet army. But need it be 
said that the Bolsheviks would only welcome military 
support of the Soviet power? We are fully alive to the 
profundity of the difference between military support 
of the Soviet Government and participation of the Mensheviks, 
say, in the ³Defence Conference²32 during the 
imperialist war under Kerensky. 
All that is so. But experience has taught us not to 
take people at their word; we are accustomed to judge 
parties and groups not only by their resolutions, but, 
and chiefly, by their deeds. 
And what are the deeds of the Mensheviks? 
The Mensheviks in the Ukraine have to this day not 
broken with Skoropadsky¹s counter-revolutionary government 
and are fighting the Soviet elements in the 
Ukraine with every means in their power, thus supporting 
the rule of the home and foreign imperialists in the 
South. 
The Mensheviks in the Caucasus long ago formed 
an alliance with the landlords and capitalists, proclaimed 
sacred war on the supporters of the October Revolution, 
and called in the aid of the German imperialists.

THE LOGIC OF FACTS 147 
The Mensheviks in the Urals and Siberia have made 
common cause with the British and French imperialists 
and have given, and are continuing to give, practical 
help in abolishing the gains of the October Revolution. 
The Mensheviks in Krasnovodsk have opened the 
gate of the Transcaspian area to the British imperialists, 
helping them to suppress Soviet power in Turkestan. 
Lastly, a section of the Mensheviks in European 
Russia preaches the necessity of ³active² ³struggle² 
against the Soviet power and organizes counter-revolutionary 
strikes in the rear of our army, which is 
shedding its blood in a war for the liberation of Russia, 
thus making the ³support of the military actions of 
the Soviet Government² advocated by the Menshevik 
Central Committee a practical impossibility. 
All these anti-socialist and counter-revolutionary Menshevik 
elements in the centre and in the border regions of 
Russia continue to this day to consider themselves members 
of the Menshevik Party, whose Central Committee 
now solemnly proclaims its ³political solidarity² with 
the Soviet power. 
We ask: 
1) What is the attitude of the Central Committee of 
the Menshevik Party to the above-mentioned counterrevolutionary 
Menshevik elements? 
2) Does it intend to break with them emphatically 
and irrevocably? 
3) Has it taken even the first step in this direction? 
All these are questions to which we do not find 
answers either in the ³resolution² of the Menshevik

J. V. S T A L I N 148 
Central Committee or in the practical activities of the 
Mensheviks. 
Yet it is unquestionable that only by emphatically 
breaking with the counter-revolutionary Menshevik elements 
could the Menshevik Central Committee further 
that ³mutual agreement² which it is now advocating.

SPEECH DELIVERED AT A PLENARY 
MEETING OF THE MOSCOW SOVIET 
OF WORKERS¹, SOLDIERS¹ 
AND PEASANTS¹ DEPUTIES 
ON THE SITUATION 
ON THE SOUTHERN FRONT 
October 29, 1918 
(Newspaper Report) 
There is no need to prove that the strength of Soviet 
Russia is growing, Comrade Stalin said. Its successes are 
sufficient proof of that. But never before have the enemies 
of Soviet Russia tried so stubbornly to break us. The 
plan of the enemies of Soviet Russia is to wrest her 
richest grain regions from her and compel her to capitulate 
without a fight. Five or six months ago, Samara 
and Siberia were selected for the execution of this plan. 
The past two months have made it clear to our enemies 
that this plan is unfeasible. Now they are trying to repeat 
the adventure in the South. The South exercises a great 
attractive power. There are no less than 150 million 
poods of available grain there. There are also hundreds 
of thousands of poods of coal. South Russia is even more 
important strategically. A new international knot is 
being tied in this region. This can be seen from the 
activity going on there. A new government has been 
formed in Yekaterinodar, headed by Krasnov. Three armies 
have united there. In their effort to seize possession

J. V. S T A L I N 150 
of the South, the counter-revolutionaries are aiming their 
main blow at Tsaritsyn. In August, Krasnov issued an 
order for the capture of Tsaritsyn. The order was not 
carried out, and Krasnov¹s army had to seek safety in 
flight. In October, Krasnov issued another order: to 
capture Tsaritsyn by October 15 at any cost and link up 
with the Czechoslovaks. No less than forty regiments 
of the combined armies of a number of generals were 
thrown into action. However, the generals had to seek 
safety in flight‹so that one of them even lost his boots. 
(Laughter.) 
Only then did the generals realize that our army 
represents a real and growing force, too powerful for 
them to cope with. 
Wherein lies the strength of our army? Why is it 
beating its enemies so effectively? 
The strength of our army lies in its political consciousness 
and discipline. Political consciousness and 
proletarian discipline‹these are among the reasons for 
our success on the Southern Front. 
Another reason is the appearance of a new corps of 
Red officers. They are mostly former privates who received 
their baptism of fire in a number of engagements 
and well understand the job of fighting. They are leading 
our troops to victory. 
These are the chief factors determining the successes 
of our army. That is why I think that the blackguard 
bands will never succeed in vanquishing our army in the 
South.

THE SOUTH OF RUSSIA 
Pravda Interview 
People¹s Commissar Stalin, who recently returned from his 
mission in the South, gave our correspondent his impressions 
of the situation on the Southern Front. 
IMPORTANCE OF THE SOUTHERN FRONT 
Its strategical position alone, situated as it is between 
the Don counter-revolutionaries and the Astrakhan- 
Ural-Czechoslovak bands, shows how important the 
Southern Front is. The proximity of the British sphere 
of influence (Enzeli, Krasnovodsk) only adds to its 
importance. South Russia¹s rich resources (grain, oil, 
coal, cattle, fish) are in themselves enough to inflame 
the voracious appetites of the imperialist wolves who 
are striving to wrest this important area from Russia. 
Furthermore, it is certain that with the approach of 
autumn and the liquidation of the Samara adventure the 
centre of military operations will shift to the South. 
That, in fact, explains the ³feverish² activity which 
the southern counter-revolutionaries are now displaying 
in hastily forming a new (brand new!) ³all-Russian 
government² composed of those tsarist menials Shipov, 
Sazonov and Lukomsky, in uniting Krasnov¹s, Denikin¹s 
and Skoropadsky¹s bands into one army, in appealing 
for help to Britain, and so on.

J. V. S T A L I N 152 
TSARITSYN THE MAIN TARGET 
It is on Tsaritsyn that the enemy is concentrating 
his heaviest fire. That is understandable, because the 
capture of Tsaritsyn and the severance of our communications 
with the South, would ensure the achievement 
of all the enemy¹s objectives: connection would 
be established between the Don counter-revolutionaries 
and the Cossack top sections of the Astrakhan and Ural 
troops and a united counter-revolutionary front stretching 
from the Don to the Czechoslovaks would be 
created; the counter-revolutionaries, domestic and foreign, 
would secure a firm hold of the South and the Caspian; 
the Soviet forces in the North Caucasus would be in a 
helpless plight. . . . 
That is the chief reason for the stubborn efforts of the 
southern whiteguards to capture Tsaritsyn. 
Krasnov issued an order for the capture of Tsaritsyn as 
far back as August. His bands hurled themselves with frenzy 
against our front and tried to break it, but were beaten 
off by our Red Army and thrown back beyond the Don. 
A fresh order to capture Tsaritsyn was issued in the 
early part of October, this time by the counter-revolutionary 
Cossack Assembly in Rostov. The enemy massed 
no less than forty regiments gathered from the Don, 
Kiev (Skoropadsky¹s officer regiments!) and the Kuban 
(Alexeyev¹s ³volunteers²!). But this time, too, Krasnov¹s 
bands were repulsed by the iron hand of our Red Army. 
A number of the enemy¹s regiments were surrounded by 
our troops and wiped out, leaving their guns, machine 
guns and rifles in our hands. Generals Mamontov, Antonov, 
Popov and Tolkushkin and a whole pack of colonels 
were forced to seek safety in flight.

THE SOUTH OF RUSSIA 153 
WHEREIN LIES THE STRENGTH OF OUR ARMY? 
The successes of our army are due in the first place 
to its political consciousness and discipline. Krasnov¹s 
soldiers are amazingly obtuse and ignorant and are completely 
isolated from the outside world. They do not 
know what they are fighting for. ³We had to fight because 
we were ordered to,² they say on being interrogated 
when taken prisoner. 
Not so our Red Army man. He proudly calls himself 
a soldier of the revolution; he knows that he is fighting 
not to protect capitalist profits but for the emancipation 
of Russia, and knowing this he goes into battle 
boldly and with his eyes open. The yearning for order and 
discipline among our Red Army men is so strong that 
not infrequently they themselves punish ³disobedient² 
and ill-disciplined comrades. 
A no less important factor is the appearance of a regular 
corps of Red officers who have been promoted 
from the ranks and who received their baptism of fire 
in a number of engagements. These Red officers are the 
chief cementing force of our army, welding it into a 
single disciplined organism. 
But the strength of the army is not due to its personal 
qualities alone. An army cannot exist for long 
without a strong rear. For the front to be firm, it is 
necessary that the army should regularly receive replenishments, 
munitions and food from the rear. A great 
role in this respect has been played by the appearance in 
the rear of expert and competent administrators, chiefly 
consisting of advanced workers, who conscientiously and 
indefatigably attend to the duties of mobilization and

J. V. S T A L I N 154 
supply. It may be safely said that without these administrators 
Tsaritsyn would not have been saved. 
All this is converting our army into a formidable 
force capable of smashing any resistance on the part of 
the enemy. 
Everything is tending towards the tying of a new 
international knot in the South. The appearance in 
Yekaterinodar of a ³new² ³all-Russian government² composed 
of British proteges, the combining of the three 
counter-revolutionary armies (Alexeyev¹s, Skoropadsky¹s 
and Krasnov¹s), which have once already been 
beaten by our forces at Tsaritsyn, the rumours that Britain 
is contemplating intervention, the fact that Britain 
is supplying the Terek counter-revolutionaries from 
Enzeli and Krasnovodsk‹all these are not just chance 
happenings. Their abortive adventure in Samara they are 
now trying to resume in the South. But they will not 
have‹will certainly not have‹that without which 
victory is unthinkable, namely, an army which has its 
heart in the foul work of counter-revolution and is capable 
of fighting to the end. One powerful assault will be sufficient, 
and the counter-revolutionary adventure will collapse 
like a house of cards. The earnest of this is the 
heroism of our army, the demoralization in the ranks of 
the Krasnov-Alexeyev ³armies,² the growing unrest in 
the Ukraine, the increasing might of Soviet Russia, and, 
lastly, the steady spread of the revolutionary movement 
in the West. The southern adventure will meet with the 
same fate as the Samara adventure.

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 
(October 24 and 25, 1917, in Petrograd) 
The most important of the events which hastened 
the October uprising were: the intention of the Provisional 
Government (after having surrendered Riga) to 
surrender Petrograd, the Kerensky Government¹s preparations 
to remove to Moscow, the decision of the 
command of the old army to dispatch the entire Petrograd 
garrison to the front and leave the capital undefended, 
and, lastly, the feverish activity of the Black 
Congress33 in Moscow, headed by Rodzyanko‹activity 
for organizing the counter-revolution. All this, coupled 
with the growing economic disruption and the unwillingness 
of the men at the front to continue the war, 
made a swift and efficiently organized uprising inevitable 
as the only way out of the existing situation. 
The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party had 
already in the closing days of September decided to mobilize 
all the forces of the Party for the organization of 
a successful uprising. With that in view, the Central 
Committee resolved to set up a Revolutionary Military 
Committee in Petrograd, to secure the retention of the 
Petrograd garrison in the capital, and to convene an 
All-Russian Congress of Soviets. Only such a congress 
could succeed to power. The preliminary winning of

J. V. S T A L I N 156 
the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets, the most influential 
in the rear and at the front, was an indispensable 
part of the general plan of organization of the uprising. 
Acting on the instructions of the Central Committee, 
Rabochy Put,34 the Central Organ of the Party, began 
openly to call for an uprising, preparing the workers and 
peasants for the decisive battle. 
The first open clash with the Provisional Government 
arose over the banning of the Bolshevik newspaper, 
Rabochy Put. It was shut down by order of the Provisional 
Government. It was re-opened in revolutionary 
fashion, by order of the Revolutionary Military Committee. 
The seals were removed and the commissars of 
the Provisional Government were sent off. That was on 
October 24. 
On October 24, commissars of the Revolutionary 
Military Committee forcibly ejected the representatives 
of the Provisional Government from a number of major 
government institutions, which resulted in the latter 
coming under the control of the Revolutionary Military 
Committee and the disorganization of the whole 
machinery of the Provisional Government. That same day 
(October 24) the entire garrison, all the regiments in 
Petrograd, decisively went over to the Revolutionary 
Military Committee, with the sole exception of some of 
the military cadet schools and an armoured car battalion. 
The Provisional Government showed signs of irresolution. 
Only in the evening did it dispatch shock battalions 
to occupy the bridges and succeeded in raising 
some of them. The Revolutionary Military Committee 
countered this by sending sailors and Vyborg Red Guards, 
who removed and dispersed the shock battalions and

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 157 
occupied the bridges themselves. With this, the open 
uprising began. A number of our regiments were dispatched 
with orders to cordon off the whole area around 
the Staff Headquarters and the Winter Palace. In the 
Winter Palace the Provisional Government was in session. 
The passing of the armoured car battalion to the side of 
the Revolutionary Military Committee (late at night on 
October 24) hastened the success of the uprising. 
On October 25 the Congress of Soviets opened, and to 
it the Revolutionary Military Committee turned over 
the power it had won. 
Early in the morning of October 26, after the bombardment 
of the Winter Palace and the Staff Headquarters 
by the Aurora, and after skirmishes between 
Soviet troops and military cadets in front of the Winter 
Palace, the Provisional Government capitulated. 
The moving spirit of the revolution from beginning 
to end was the Central Committee of the Party, headed 
by Comrade Lenin. Vladimir Ilyich was then living in 
hiding in Petrograd, in the Vyborg District. On the 
evening of October 24 he was called to the Smolny to 
take charge of the movement. 
An outstanding role in the October uprising was 
played by the sailors of the Baltic Fleet and the Red 
Guards from the Vyborg District. Owing to their extraordinary 
courage, the role of the Petrograd garrison was 
confined chiefly to rendering moral and to some extent 
military support to the vanguard fighters.

AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
The national question must not be regarded as something 
self-contained and fixed for all time. Being only 
part of the general question of the transformation of 
the existing order, the national question is wholly determined 
by the conditions of the social environment, by 
the kind of power in the country and by the whole 
course of social development in general. This is being 
strikingly borne out in the period of revolution in Russia, 
when the national question and the national movement 
in the border regions of Russia are rapidly and obviously 
changing their character in accordance with the course 
and outcome of the revolution. 
I 
THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION 
AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
In the period of the bourgeois revolution in Russia 
(February 1917) the national movement in the border 
regions bore the character of a bourgeois liberation 
movement. The nationalities of Russia, which 
for ages had been oppressed and exploited by the ³old

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 159 
regime,² for the first time felt their strength and rushed 
into the fight with their oppressors. ³Abolish national 
oppression²‹such was the slogan of the movement. 
³All-national² institutions sprang up overnight 
throughout the border regions of Russia. The movement 
was headed by the national, bourgeois-democratic 
intelligentsia. ³National Councils² in Latvia, the 
Estonian region, Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
the North Caucasus, Kirghizia and the Middle 
Volga region; the ³Rada² in the Ukraine and in Byelorussia; 
the ³Sfatul Tsärii² in Bessarabia; the ³Kurultai² 
in the Crimea and in Bashkiria; the ³Autonomous 
Government² in Turkestan‹such were the ³all-national² 
institutions around which the national bourgeoisie 
rallied its forces. It was a question of emancipation from 
tsarism‹the ³fundamental cause² of national oppression‹
and of the formation of national bourgeois states. 
The right of nations to self-determination was interpreted 
as the right of the national bourgeoisies in the border 
regions to take power into their own hands and to take 
advantage of the February Revolution for forming ³their 
own² national states. The further development of the 
revolution did not, and could not, come within the 
calculations of the above-mentioned bourgeois institutions. 
And the fact was overlooked that tsarism was 
being replaced by naked and barefaced imperialism, 
and that this imperialism was a stronger and more dangerous 
foe of the nationalities and the basis of a new national 
oppression. 
The abolition of tsarism and the accession to power 
of the bourgeoisie did not, however, lead to the abolition 
of national oppression. The old, crude form of

J. V. S T A L I N 160 
national oppression was replaced by a new, refined, but 
all the more dangerous, form of oppression. Far from 
abandoning the policy of national oppression, the Lvov- 
Milyukov-Kerensky Government organized a new campaign 
against Finland (dispersal of the Diet in the summer 
of 1917) and the Ukraine (suppression of Ukrainian 
cultural institutions). What is more, that Government, 
which was imperialist by its very nature, called upon 
the population to continue the war in order to subjugate 
new lands, new colonies and nationalities. It was compelled 
to this not only because of the intrinsic nature 
of imperialism, but also because of the existence of the old 
imperialist states in the West, which were irresistibly 
striving to subjugate new lands and nationalities and 
threatening to narrow its sphere of influence. A struggle 
of the imperialist states for the subjugation of small 
nationalities as a condition for the existence of these 
states‹such was the picture which was revealed in the 
course of the imperialist war. This unsightly picture was 
in no way improved by the abolition of tsarism and 
the appearance of the Milyukov-Kerensky Government 
on the scene. Since the ³all-national² institutions in the 
border regions displayed a tendency to political independence, 
naturally they encountered the insuperable 
hostility of the imperialist government of Russia. Since, 
on the other hand, while establishing the power of the 
national bourgeoisie, they remained deaf to the vital 
interests of ³their own² workers and peasants, they 
evoked grumbling and discontent among those. What were 
known as the ³national regiments² only added fuel 
to the flames: they were impotent against the danger 
from above and only intensified and aggravated the

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 161 
danger from below. The ³all-national² institutions were 
left defenceless against blows from without and explosions 
from within. The incipient bourgeois national 
states began to fade before they could blossom. 
Thus, the old bourgeois-democratic interpretation of 
the principle of self-determination became a fiction and 
lost its revolutionary significance. It was clear that 
under such circumstances there could be no question of 
the abolition of national oppression and establishing the 
independence of the small national states. It became 
obvious that the emancipation of the labouring masses of 
the oppressed nationalities and the abolition of national 
oppression were inconceivable without a break with imperialism, 
without the labouring masses overthrowing 
³their own² national bourgeoisie and taking power themselves. 
That was strikingly borne out after the October 
Revolution. 
II 
THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 
AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
The February Revolution harboured irreconcilable 
inner contradictions. The revolution was accomplished 
by the efforts of the workers and the peasants (soldiers), 
but as a result of the revolution power passed not to the 
workers and peasants, but to the bourgeoisie. In making 
the revolution the workers and peasants wanted to put 
an end to the war and to secure peace. But the bourgeoisie, 
on coming to power, strove to use the revolutionary 
ardour of the masses for a continuation of the war

J. V. S T A L I N 162 
and against peace. The economic disruption of the 
country and the food crisis demanded the expropriation 
of capital and industrial establishments for the 
benefit of the workers, and the confiscation of the landlords¹ 
land for the benefit of the peasants, but the bourgeois 
Milyukov-Kerensky Government stood guard over 
the interests of the landlords and capitalists, resolutely 
protecting them against all encroachments on the part 
of the workers and peasants. It was a bourgeois revolution, 
accomplished by the agency of the workers and 
peasants for the benefit of the exploiters. 
Meanwhile, the country continued to groan under 
the burden of the imperialist war, economic disintegration 
and the breakdown of the food supply. The front 
was falling to pieces and melting away. Factories and 
mills were coming to a standstill. Famine was spreading 
through the country. The February Revolution, 
with its inner contradictions, was obviously not enough 
for ³the salvation of the country.² The Milyukov-Berensky 
Government was obviously incapable of solving 
the basic problems of the revolution. 
A new, socialist revolution was required to lead the 
country out of the blind alley of imperialist war and 
economic disintegration. 
That revolution came as a result of the October 
uprising. 
By overthrowing the power of the landlords and the 
bourgeoisie and replacing it by a government of workers 
and peasants, the October Revolution resolved the contradictions 
of the February Revolution at one stroke. 
The abolition of the omnipotence of the landlords and 
kulaks and the handing over of the land for the use of the

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 163 
labouring masses of the countryside; the expropriation of 
the mills and factories and their transfer to control 
by the workers; the break with imperialism and the 
ending of the predatory war; the publication of the 
secret treaties and the exposure of the policy of annexations; 
lastly, the proclamation of self-determination for 
the labouring masses of the oppressed peoples and the 
recognition of the independence of Finland‹such were 
he basic measures carried into effect by the Soviet power 
in the early period of the Soviet revolution. 
That was a genuinely socialist revolution. 
The revolution, which started in the centre, could 
not long be confined to that narrow territory. Once having 
triumphed in the centre, it was bound to spread 
to the border regions. And, indeed, from the very first 
days of the revolution, the revolutionary tide spread 
from the North all over Russia, sweeping one border 
region after another. But here it encountered a dam 
in the shape of the ³National Councils² and regional 
³governments² (Don, Kuban, Siberia) which had been 
formed prior to the October Revolution. The point is 
that these ³national governments² would not hear of 
a socialist revolution. Bourgeois by nature, they had 
not the slightest wish to destroy the old, bourgeois order; 
on the contrary, they considered it their duty to preserve 
and consolidate it by every means in their power. 
Essentially imperialist, they had not the slightest wish 
to break with imperialism; on the contrary, they had 
never been averse to seizing and subjugating bits and 
morsels of the territory of ³foreign² nationalities whenever 
opportunity offered. No wonder that the ³national 
governments² in the border regions declared war on

J. V. S T A L I N 164 
the socialist government in the centre. And, once they 
had declared war, they naturally became hotbeds of reaction, 
which attracted all that was counter-revolutionary 
in Russia. Everyone knows that all the counter-revolutionaries 
thrown out of Russia rushed to these hotbeds, and 
there, around them, formed themselves into whiteguard 
³national² regiments. 
But, in addition to ³national governments,² there 
are in the border regions national workers and peasants. 
Organized even before the October Revolution in 
their revolutionary Soviets patterned on the Soviets in 
the centre of Russia, they had never severed connections 
with their brothers in the North. They too were 
striving to defeat the bourgeoisie; they too were fighting 
for the triumph of socialism. No wonder that their 
conflict with ³their own² national governments grew 
daily more acute. The October Revolution only strengthened 
the alliance between the workers and peasants 
of the border regions and the workers and peasants of 
Russia, and inspired them with faith in the triumph 
of socialism. And the war of the ³national governments² 
against the Soviet power brought the conflict of 
the national masses with these ³governments² to the 
point of a complete rupture, to open rebellion against 
them. 
Thus was formed a socialist alliance of the workers 
and peasants of all Russia against the counter-revolutionary 
alliance of the bourgeois national ³governments² 
of the border regions of Russia. 
The fight of the border ³governments² is depicted by 
some as a fight for national emancipation against the 
³soulless centralism² of the Soviet regime. But that is

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 165 
quite untrue. No regime in the world has permitted such 
extensive decentralization, no government in the world 
has ever granted to the peoples such complete national 
freedom as the Soviet power in Russia. The fight of the 
border ³governments² was, and is, a fight of bourgeois 
counter-revolution against socialism. The national flag 
is tacked on to the cause only to deceive the masses, as 
a popular flag which conveniently conceals the counterrevolutionary 
designs of the national bourgeoisie. 
But the fight of the ³national² and regional ³governments² 
proved an unequal one. Attacked from two sides 
‹from without by the Soviet power of Russia, and 
from within by ³their own² workers and peasants‹the 
³national governments² were obliged to retreat after 
the very first engagements. The uprising of the Finnish 
workers and torppari35 and the flight of the bourgeois 
³Senate²; the uprising of the Ukrainian workers and peasants 
and the flight of the bourgeois ³Rada²; the uprising 
of the workers and peasants in the Don, Kuban, and 
Siberia and the collapse of Kaledin, Kornilov and the 
Siberian ³government²; the uprising of the poor peasants 
of Turkestan and the flight of the ³autonomous government²; 
the agrarian revolution in the Caucasus and the 
utter impotence of the ³National Councils² of Georgia, 
Armenia and Azerbaijan‹all these are generally known 
facts which demonstrated the complete isolation of the 
border ³governments² from ³their own² labouring masses. 
Utterly defeated, the ³national governments² were 
³obliged² to appeal for aid against ³their own² workers 
and peasants to the imperiaIists of the West, to the agelong 
oppressors and exploiters of the nationalities of 
the world.

J. V. S T A L I N 166 
Thus began the period of foreign intervention and 
occupation of the border regions‹a period which once 
more revealed the counter-revolutionary character of the 
³national² and regional ³governments.² 
Only now did i t become obvious to all that the 
national bourgeoisie was striving not for the liberation of 
³its own people² from national oppression, but for liberty 
to squeeze profits out of them, for liberty to retain its 
privileges and capital. 
Only now did it become clear that the emancipation 
of the oppressed nationalities was inconceivable without 
a rupture with imperialism, without the overthrow of 
the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nationalities, without 
the transfer of power to the labouring masses of these 
nationalities. 
Thus, the old, bourgeois conception of the principle 
of self-determination, with its slogan ³All power 
to the national bourgeoisie,² was exposed and cast aside 
by the very course of the revolution. The socialist conception 
of the principle of self-determination, with its 
slogan ³All power to the labouring masses of the oppressed 
nationalities,² entered into its own and it became possible 
to apply it. 
Thus, the October Revolution, having put an end to 
the old, bourgeois movement for national emancipation, 
inaugurated the era of a new, socialist movement of the 
workers and peasants of the oppressed nationalities, directed 
against all oppression‹including, therefore, national 
oppression‹against the power of the bourgeoisie, ³their 
own² and foreign, and against imperialism in general.

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 167 
III 
THE WORLD-WIDE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 
Having triumphed in the centre of Russia and embraced 
a number of the border regions, the October Revolution 
could not stop short at the territorial borders 
of Russia. In the atmosphere of the imperialist world 
war and the general discontent among the masses, it 
could not but spread to neighbouring countries. Russia¹s 
break with imperialism and its escape from the predatory 
war; the publication of the secret treaties and 
the solemn renunciation of the policy of annexations; 
the proclamation of the national freedom and recognition 
of the independence of Finland; the declaring 
of Russia a ³federation of Soviet national republics² 
and the battle cry of a determined struggle against imperialism 
issued to the world by the Soviet Government 
‹all this could not but deeply affect the enslaved East 
and the bleeding West. 
And, indeed, the October Revolution is the first 
revolution in world history to break the age-long sleep of 
the labouring masses of the oppressed peoples of the East 
and to draw them into the fight against world imperialism. 
The formation of workers¹ and peasants¹ Soviets 
in Persia, China and India, modelled on the Soviets in 
Russia, is sufficiently convincing evidence of this. 
The October Revolution is the first revolution in 
world history to provide the workers and soldiers of the 
West with a living, salvation-bringing example and 
to impel them on to the path of real emancipation from

J. V. S T A L I N 168 
the yoke of war and imperialism. The uprising of the workers 
and soldiers in Austria-Hungary and Germany, the 
formation of Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies, 
the revolutionary struggle of the subject peoples of 
Austria-Hungary against national oppression is sufficiently 
eloquent evidence of this. 
The chief point is not at all that the struggle in the 
East and even in the West has not yet succeeded in shedding 
its bourgeois-nationalist features; the point is that 
the struggle against imperialism has begun, that it is 
continuing and is inevitably bound to arrive at its 
logical goal. 
Foreign intervention and the occupation policy of 
the ³external² imperialists merely sharpen the revolutionary 
crisis, by drawing now peoples into the struggle 
and extending the area of the revolutionary battles with, 
imperialism. 
Thus, the October Revolution, by establishing a tie 
between the peoples of the backward East and of the 
advanced West, is ranging them in a common camp 
of struggle against imperialism. 
Thus, from the particular question of combating 
national oppression, the national question is evolving 
into the general question of emancipating the nations, 
colonies and semi-colonies from imperialism. 
The mortal sin of the Second International and 
its leader, Kautsky, consists, incidentally, in the fact 
that they have always gone over to the bourgeois conception 
of national self-determination, that they have 
never understood the revolutionary meaning of the latter, 
that they were unable or unwilling to put the national 
question on the revolutionary footing of an open fight

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL QUESTION 169 
against imperialism, that they were unable or unwilling 
to link the national question with the question of the 
emancipation of the colonies. 
The obtuseness of the Austrian Social-Democrats of 
the type of Bauer and Renner consists in the fact that 
they have not understood the inseparable connection 
between the national question and the question of 
power, that they tried to separate the national question 
from politics and to confine i t to cultural and 
educational questions, forgetting the existence of such 
³trifles² as imperialism and the colonies enslaved by 
imperialism. 
It is asserted that the principles of self-determination 
and ³defence of the fatherland² have been abrogated 
by the very course of events under the conditions of a 
rising socialist revolution. Actually, it is not the principles 
of self-determination and ³defence of the fatherland² 
that have been abrogated, but the bourgeois interpretation 
of these principles. One has only to glance at the 
occupied regions, which are languishing under the yoke 
of imperialism and are yearning for liberation; one has 
only to glance at Russia, which is waging a revolutionary 
war for the defence of the socialist fatherland from the 
imperialist robbers; one has only to reflect on the present 
events in Austria-Hungary; one has only to glance 
at the enslaved colonies and semi-colonies, which have 
already organized their own Soviets (India, Persia, 
China)‹one has only to glance at all this to realize the 
whole revolutionary significance of the principle of selfdetermination 
in its socialist interpretation. 
The great world-wide significance of the October 
Revolution chiefly consists in the fact that:

J. V. S T A L I N 170 
1) It has widened the scope of the national question 
and converted it from the particular question of combating 
national oppression in Europe into the general 
question of emancipating the oppressed peoples, colonies 
and semi-colonies from imperialism; 
2) It has opened up wide possibilities for their emancipation 
and the right paths towards it, has thereby 
greatly facilitated the cause of the emancipation of the 
oppressed peoples of the West and the East, and has 
drawn them into the common current of the victorious 
struggle against imperialism; 
3) It has thereby erected a bridge between the socialist 
West and the enslaved East, having created a new front of 
revolutions against world imperialism, extending from 
the proletarians of the West, through the Russian revolution, 
to the oppressed peoples of the East. 
This in fact explains the indescribable enthusiasm 
which is now being displayed for the Russian proletariat 
by the toiling and exploited masses of the East and 
the West. 
And this mainly explains the frenzy with which the 
imperialist robbers of the whole world have now flung 
themselves upon Soviet Russia.

PARTITION WALL 
Between socialist Russia and the revolutionary West 
a partition wall has been erected in the shape of the 
occupied regions. 
Whereas in Russia the Red flag has been waving for 
over a year now, and in the West, in Germany and Austria-
Hungary, outbreaks of proletarian uprisings are multiplying 
daily and hourly, in the occupied regions, in 
Finland, Estland, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Poland, 
Bessarabia, the Ukraine and the Crimea, bourgeois 
nationalist ³governments² continue to drag out 
a wretched existence by the grace of the imperialists of 
the West whose time is coming to an end. 
Whereas in the East and in the West ³great² monarchs 
and ³sovereign² imperialists have already been 
relegated to the nether regions, in the occupied areas 
petty kinglets and puny robbers continue to rule, committing 
lawlessness and violence against the workers 
and peasants, arresting and shooting them. 
More, these out-of-date ³governments² are feverishly 
organizing their ³national² whiteguard ³regiments,² are 
preparing for ³action,² are conspiring with the not yet

J. V. S T A L I N 172 
abolished imperialist governments and laying plans for 
the ³expansion² of ³their² territories. 
These shadows, rotting alive, of already overthrown 
³great² monarchs, and these puny ³national² ³governments² 
which have been placed by the will of fate 
between the two tremendous conflagrations of revolution, 
in the East and in the West, are now dreaming of extinguishing 
the general fire of revolution in Europe, of 
perpetuating their ludicrous existence, of turning back 
the wheel of history! . . . 
That which the ³sovereign² monarchs of ³great² 
Germany and Austria-Hungary failed to accomplish, 
these petty ³kinglets² dream of accomplishing ³at one 
stroke,² with the help of a couple of disorganized whiteguard 
³regiments.² 
We do not doubt that the mighty waves of revolution 
in Russia and the West will ruthlessly sweep 
away the counter-revolutionary dreamers in the occupied 
regions. We do not doubt that the hour is near when 
the ³kinglets² of these regions will follow in the footsteps 
of their former ³sovereign² patrons in Russia and 
Germany. 
We have no reason to doubt that the counterrevolutionary 
partition wall between the revolutionary 
West and socialist Russia will in the end be swept 
away. 
The first signs of revolution in the occupied regions 
have already appeared. The strikes in Estland, the demonstrations 
in Latvia, the general strike in the Ukraine, 
the universal revolutionary ferment in Finland, Poland 
and Latvia‹all these are the first signs. Needless to

PARTITION WALL 173 
say, revolution and Soviet governments in these regions 
are matters of the very near future. 
Proletarian revolution, awe-inspiring and mighty, 
is on the march through the world. The old ³lords² of 
the earth in the East and the West bend their heads 
before it in fear and trembling, and their old crowns 
are falling. The occupied regions and their petty ³kinglets² 
can be no exception.

DON¹T FORGET THE EAST 
At a time when the revolutionary movement is rising 
in Europe, when old thrones and crowns are tumbling 
and giving place to revolutionary Soviets of Workers and 
Soldiers, and the occupied regions are ejecting the creatures 
of imperialism from their territories, the eyes of 
all are naturally turned to the West. It is there, in the 
West, that the chains of imperialism, which were forged 
in Europe and which are strangling the whole world, 
must first of all be smashed. It is there, first of all in 
the West, that the new, socialist life must vigorously 
develop. At such a moment one ³involuntarily² tends to 
lose sight of, to forget the far-off East, with its hundreds 
of millions of inhabitants enslaved by imperialism. 
Yet the East should not be forgotten for a single 
moment, if only because it represents the ³inexhaustible² 
reserve and ³most reliable² rear of world imperialism 
. 
The imperialists have always looked upon the East 
as the basis of their prosperity. Have not the inestimable 
natural resources (cotton, oil, gold, coal, ores) 
of the East been an ³apple of discord² between the imperialists 
of all countries? That, in fact, explains why, 
while fighting in Europe and prating about the West, the

DON¹T FORGET THE EAST 175 
imperialists have never ceased to think of China, India, 
Persia, Egypt and Morocco, because the East was always 
the real point at issue. It is this that chiefly explains 
why they so zealously maintain ³law and order² in the 
countries of the East‹without this, imperialism¹s far 
rear would not be secure. 
But it is not only the wealth of the East that the 
imperialists need. They also need the ³obedient² ³man 
power² which abounds in the colonies and semi-colonies 
of the East. They need the ³compliant² and cheap ³labour 
power² of the Eastern peoples. They need, furthermore, 
the ³obedient² ³young lads² of the countries of the East 
from whom they recruit the so-called ³coloured² troops 
which they will not hesitate to hurl against ³their own² 
revolutionary workers. That is why they call the Eastern 
countries their ³inexhaustible² reserve. 
It is the task of communism to break the age-long 
sleep of the oppressed peoples of the East, to infect 
the workers and peasants of these countries with the 
emancipatory spirit of revolution, to rouse them to 
fight imperialism, and thus deprive world imperialism 
of its ³most reliable² rear and ³inexhaustible² reserve. 
Without this, the definite triumph of socialism, 
complete victory over imperialism, is unthinkable. 
The revolution in Russia was the first to rouse the 
oppressed peoples of the East to fight imperialism. The 
Soviets in Persia, India and China are a clear symptom 
that the age-long sleep of the workers and peasants 
of the East is becoming a thing of the past. 
Revolution in the West will undoubtedly give a 
new spur to the revolutionary movement in the East, 
will infuse it with courage and faith in victory.

J. V. S T A L I N 176 
And no little help in revolutionizing the East will 
be rendered by the imperialists themselves, with their 
new annexations, which are drawing new countries into 
the fight against imperialism and extending the base of 
world revolution. 
It is the duty of the Communists to intervene in the 
growing spontaneous movement in the East and to 
develop it further, into a conscious struggle against 
imperialism. 
From that standpoint, the resolution of the recent 
Conference of Moslem Communists,36 calling for more 
intense propaganda in the East‹in Persia, India and 
China‹is undoubtedly of profound revolutionary significance. 
Let us hope that our Moslem comrades will carry outtheir 
highly important decision. 
For the truth must be grasped once and for all that 
whoever desires the triumph of socialism must not forget 
the East.

THE UKRAINE IS LIBERATING ITSELF37 
The Ukraine with its natural wealth has long been 
an object of imperialist exploitation. 
Before the revolution the Ukraine was exploited by 
the Western imperialists quietly, so to speak, without 
³military operations.² French, Belgian and British 
imperialists organized huge enterprises in the Ukraine 
(coal, metal, etc.), acquired the majority of the shares 
and proceeded to suck the blood out of the Ukrainian 
people in the usual, ³lawful² and unobtrusive way. 
After the October Revolution the picture changed. 
The October Revolution snapped the threads of imperialism 
and proclaimed the land and the factories the property 
of the Ukrainian people, making it impossible for 
the imperialists to exploit in the ³ordinary,² ³unobtrusive² 
way. Imperialism was thus expelled from the 
Ukraine. 
But imperialism had no desire to yield and positively 
refused to reconcile itself to the new situation. Hence 
the ³necessity² for the forcible enslavement of the 
Ukraine, the ³necessity² for its occupation.

J. V. S T A L I N 178 
The Austro-German imperialists were the first to 
undertake the occupation of the Ukraine. The ³Rada² 
and the ³Hetmanship,² with their ³independence,² 
were only playthings and a convenient screen for this 
occupation, giving outward ³sanction² to the exploitation 
of the Ukraine by the Austro-German imperialists. 
Who is not familiar with the endless humiliations 
and tribulations undergone by the Ukraine during the 
Austro-German occupation, the destruction of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ organizations, the complete disruption 
of industry and railway transport, the hangings and 
shootings, which were such commonplace features of 
Ukrainian ³independence² under the aegis of the Austro- 
German imperialists? 
But the defeat of Austro-German imperialism and 
the victory of the German revolution have fundamentally 
changed the situation in the Ukraine. The road 
is now open for the liberation of labouring Ukraine from 
the imperialist yoke. The ruination and enslavement of 
the Ukraine are coming to an end. The fires of revolution 
now spreading in the Ukraine will consume the 
last remnants of imperialism and its ³national² hangerson. 
The ³Provisional Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Government²
38 which has risen on the tide of revolution will 
build a new life based on the rule of the Ukrainian 
workers and peasants. The ³Manifesto² of the Ukrainian 
Soviet Government, which restores the landlords¹ 
land to the peasants, the mills and factories to the 
workers, and full liberty to the labouring and exploited‹
this historic ³Manifesto² will reverberate like thunder 
through the Ukraine, striking fear into the hearts

THE UKRAINE IS LIBERATING ITSELF 179 
of i t s enemies, and ring out like a joyful peal of 
bells, gladdening and consoling the oppressed sons of 
the Ukraine. 
But the struggle is not yet over, the victory is not yet 
secure. The real struggle in the Ukraine has only just 
begun. 
At a time when German imperialism is at its last 
gasp and the ³Hetmanship² in its death agony, British 
and French imperialism is massing forces and preparing 
to land troops in the Crimea for the occupation of 
the Ukraine. They, the Anglo-French imperialists, want 
to f i l l the place left vacant by the German invaders 
of the Ukraine. At the same time, a ³Ukrainian 
Directory²39 is appearing on the scene, headed by the 
adventurer Petlura, with the slogan of the old ³independence² 
in a ³new² form‹as a new screen, one more convenient 
than the ³Hetmanship,² for the new, Anglo- 
French, occupation of the Ukraine! 
The real struggle in the Ukraine is still to come. 
We have no doubt that the Ukrainian Soviet Government 
will be able to administer a fitting rebuff to the 
new uninvited guests‹the would-be enslavers from Britain 
and France. 
We have no doubt that the Ukrainian Soviet Government 
will be able to expose the reactionary role of the 
adventure-seekers of the Vinnichenko-Petlura camp who, 
willingly or unwillingly, are paving the way for the 
incursion of the Anglo-French enslavers. 
We have no doubt that the Ukrainian Soviet Government 
will be able to rally around itself the workers 
and peasants of the Ukraine and lead them with credit 
to battle and victory.

J. V. S T A L I N 180
We call upon all loyal sons of the Soviet Ukraine to 
come to the aid of the young Ukrainian Soviet Government 
and help it in its glorious fight against the stranglers 
of the Ukraine. 
The Ukraine is liberating itself. Hasten to its aid!

LIGHT FROM THE EAST40 
Slowly but surely, the tide of the liberation movement 
is rolling from east to west, into the occupied 
regions. Slowly but just as surely, the ³new² bourgeoisrepublican 
³governments² of Estland, Latvia, Lithuania 
and Byelorussia are receding into oblivion and 
making way for the power of the workers and peasants. 
The partition wall between Russia and Germany 
is crumbling and disappearing. The slogan of bourgeois 
nationalism ³All power to the national bourgeoisie² 
is being superseded by the slogan of proletarian 
socialism ³All power to the labouring masses of the 
oppressed nationalities.² 
A year ago, after the October Revolution, the liberation 
movement advanced in the same direction and under 
the same slogan. The bourgeois-national ³governments² 
that were formed at that time in the border regions sought 
to hold back the tide of the socialist movement advancing 
from Russia and declared war on the Soviet power. 
They wished to establish separate bourgeois states in 
the border regions in order that the national bourgeoisie 
might retain power and privileges in its hands. The reader 
will recall that this counter-revolutionary scheme failed: 
attacked from within by ³their own² workers and peasants,

J. V. S T A L I N 182 
these ³governments² were forced to retreat. The occupation 
by German imperialism which followed interrupted 
the process of emancipation of the border regions and 
tipped the scales in favour of the bourgeois-national 
³governments.² Now, after the rout of German imperialism 
and the expulsion of the forces of occupation from 
the border regions, the process of the struggle for emancipation 
has been resumed with fresh vigour and in new 
and more salient forms. 
The Estland workers were the first to raise the standard 
of revolt. The Estland Labour Commune41 is victoriously 
advancing, shattering the foundations of the 
Estland bourgeois-republican ³government² and rousing 
to struggle the labouring masses of the Estland 
towns and villages. In reply to the request of the Estland 
Soviet Government, the Russian Soviet Government 
has solemnly recognized the independence of the 
Estland Socialist Republic. Need it be demonstrated 
that this act was the duty and obligation of the Russian 
Soviet Government? Soviet Russia has never looked 
upon the Western regions as its possessions. It has always 
considered that these regions are the inalienable 
possession of the labouring masses of the nationalities 
inhabiting them, that these labouring masses have the 
full right freely to determine their political destiny. 
Naturally, this does not exclude, but rather presumes 
the rendering of every assistance by Soviet Russia to 
our Estland comrades in their struggle for the emancipation 
of the working people of Estland from the bourgeois 
yoke. 
The workers of Latvia have likewise set to work 
to liberate their martyred fatherland. The re-establish

LIGHT FROM THE EAST 183 
ment of Soviets in Verro, Valka, Riga, Libau and other 
parts of Latvia, the attempts of the Riga workers to 
secure the necessary political liberties by revolutionary 
means, the swift advance of the Latvian Riflemen on Riga 
‹all this indicates that the same fate awaits the bourgeois-
republican ³government² in Latvia as in Estland. 
We have information that the establishment of a Provisional 
Soviet Government is to be officially proclaimed 
in Latvia within the next few days.42 Needless to say, 
this act, if it really occurs, will expedite and give constitutional 
shape to the emancipation of Latvia from 
imperialism. 
The workers and peasants of Lithuania are following 
in the footsteps of the Latvian workers. The formation 
of Soviets‹as yet only semi-legal, it is true‹in Vilna, 
Shauli, Kovno and other parts of Lithuania; the unparalleled 
revolutionary activity displayed by the Lithuanian 
agricultural workers in preventing the big farms 
from being pillaged by the landlords; the rapid advance 
of the Lithuanian Riflemen into the heart of Lithuania; 
and, lastly, the projected establishment, as we are informed, 
of a Provisional Soviet Government of Lithuania‹
all this indicates that the notorious Lithuanian 
Tariba43 will not escape the fate of its counterparts in 
Latvia and Estland. 
The ephemeral nature of the national ³governments² 
in the occupied regions is due not only to the fact that 
they are bourgeois in character and alien to the interests 
of the workers and peasants, but also, and chiefly, 
to the fact that they are mere appendages of the occupation 
authorities, which could not but rob them of all 
moral prestige in the eyes of the mass of the population.

J. V. S T A L I N 184 
Looked at from this standpoint, the occupation period 
undoubtedly played a beneficial part in the development 
of the border regions, as it thoroughly exposed 
the rottenness and treachery of the national bourgeoisie. 
The trend is obviously such that any day now the 
Western regions and their labouring masses, which until 
now were the victims of the fraudulent machinations 
of the imperialists, will seize their freedom and at 
long last stand on their own feet. . . . 
In the North, in Finland, things are still ³quiet.² 
But beneath this surface quietness deep internal work 
is undoubtedly proceeding, on the part of the workers 
and torppari, on the one hand, who are straining for 
emancipation, and of the Svinhufvud Government, on 
the other, which keeps changing its Ministers with 
suspicious frequency and is continually conspiring with 
British imperialist agents. The withdrawal of the occupation 
forces from Finland will undoubtedly hasten 
the liquidation of Svinhufvud¹s band of criminals, who 
have quite deservedly earned the profound contempt of 
the broad mass of the population of Finland. 
In the South, in the Ukraine, things are not so quiet 
as in Finland. Far from it! The insurrectionary troops 
are gathering strength and organizing as they advance 
southward. After an exemplarily organized three days¹ 
strike,44 Kharkov has passed under the control of the 
Soviet of Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Deputies. The Petlurites, 
the German invaders and Skoropadsky¹s agents 
are forced to reckon with the will of the workers. In Yekaterinoslav, 
a Soviet of Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Deputies 
is functioning openly. The celebrated Manifesto of the

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
185 
Ukrainian Provisional Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Government 
was printed openly and posted up in the streets 
of Yekaterinoslav. The ³authorities² were powerless to 
prevent this ³audacious act.² We say nothing of the powerful 
insurrectionary movement of the Ukrainian peasants, 
who look upon the Manifesto of the Ukrainian 
Soviet Government as their gospel. 
And in the far South, in the North Caucasus, even 
the Ingushes, Chechens, Ossetians and Kabardinians are 
passing over in whole groups to the Soviet power and, 
arms in hand, are freeing their land from the hired 
bands of British imperialism. 
Need it be said that all this is bound to have its 
effect on the oppressed peoples of the West, and above 
all on the peoples of Austria-Hungary, who are still passing 
through the period of the bourgeois-national liberation 
movement, but who have already, by virtue of 
the logic of facts, entered the phase of struggle against 
imperialism? 
At the centre of all these stupendous developments 
is the standard-bearer of world revolution, Soviet Russia, 
inspiring the workers and peasants of the oppressed 
peoples with faith in victory, and supporting their 
liberation struggle for the benefit of world socialism. 
Of course, the other camp‹the camp of the imperialists‹
is not dozing either. Its agents are prowling 
through all countries, from Finland to the Caucasus 
and from Siberia to Turkestan, supplying the counter-
revolutionaries, hatching criminal conspiracies, organizing 
a crusade against Soviet Russia, and forging 
chains for the peoples of the West. But it is surely 
obvious that the imperialist gang have already lost all 
LIGHT FROM THE EAST

J. V. S T A L I N 186 
moral prestige in the eyes of the oppressed peoples, that 
they have lost forever their former halo of standardbearers 
of ³civilization² and ³humanitarianism,² and 
that they are prolonging their predatory existence with 
the help of bribery and hired bands, and by keeping 
the so-called ³coloured² peoples of Africa in darkness 
and slavery. . . . 
Light is coming from the East! 
The West, with its imperialist cannibals, has become 
a breeding ground of darkness and slavery. The task 
is to destroy this breeding ground, to the joy and comfort 
of the working people of all countries.

THINGS ARE MOVING 
The process of liberation of the Western regions goes 
forward. The tide of revolution is steadily mounting, 
breaking down all obstacles in its path. The agents of the 
old world and the arch-reactionaries of Estland, Latvia 
and Lithuania are fleeing before it like the devil from 
holy water. 
The Estland Riflemen are already surrounding Taps, 
an important junction. Acting on the orders of the 
Council of People¹s Commissars, our navy is guarding 
Soviet Estland against possible surprises from the sea. 
The Red flag of socialism is waving over Estland. The 
labouring masses of Estland are jubilant. The liberation 
of Revel is not far off. Needless to say, if British forces 
attempt to enter Estland and occupy it, they will encounter 
the solid resistance of the entire Estonian people. 
In Lithuania, the revolutionary conflagration is 
growing. Vilna is already in the hands of the Soviet of 
Workers¹ and Landless Peasants¹ Deputies. The recent 
impressive demonstrations in Vilna45 have thoroughly 
demoralized the Tariba, that creature of the Kaiser. 
The ardent greetings sent by the Vilna Soviet to the 
Council of People¹s Commissars and the Red Army46 
speak eloquently enough of the character of the liberation 
movement in Lithuania. The fact that in Kovno, 
Shauli and other towns, and in villages and rural areas, Soviets 
are functioning under the very nose of the hangman

J. V. S T A L I N 188 
General Hoffmann shows how strong the onslaught of 
the Soviet revolution is. With its fiery manifesto, the 
Lithuanian Workers¹ Government47 formed in Vileika 
will undoubtedly constitute a reliable rallying centre 
for the revolutionary forces of Lithuania. The Lithuanian 
Red Riflemen will bring liberation to their country. 
The recognition of the Lithuanian Workers¹ Government 
by the Soviet Government of Russia48 will strengthen 
their faith in final victory. 
The revolution is mounting swiftly and irresistibly 
in Latvia. The glorious Latvian Red Riflemen have 
already captured Valka and are victoriously surrounding 
Riga. The recently formed Soviet Government of Latvia 
is leading the Latvian workers and landless peasants to 
victory with a sure hand. Exposing the equivocal policy 
of the Berlin Government and the German occupation 
authorities, it declares unreservedly in its Manifesto: 
³We emphatically reject all intervention on behalf 
of our feudal and bourgeois enemies, even if such intervention 
is threatened by a government that calls itself 
socialist.² 
The Latvian Soviet Government relies only on the 
assistance of the revolutionary proletariat of all countries, 
and of Russia first and foremost. It says: 
³We call for aid and expect it from the genuinely revolutionary 
proletariat of the whole world, and especially 
of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.² 
Need it be said that the Soviet Government of Russia 
will render every possible assistance to Latvia now in 
process of liberation and to its heroic Riflemen? 
In the North, in Finland, all is still ³quiet.² But 
beneath the surface of quiet and tranquility the counter

THINGS ARE MOVING 189 
revolutionaries are not slumbering and are preparing for 
new battles. Svinhufvud¹s resignation and the appointment 
of Mannerheim imply the renunciation of internal 
³reforms² and indicate that Britain is planning an 
attack on Petrograd, through Finland. And that, of 
course, is bound to intensify the revolutionary crisis which 
is ripening in Finland. 
In the Ukraine, the smoothly staged flight of Skoropadsky 
and the recognition of Vinnichenko¹s Directory by 
the Entente reveal a new picture, a picture of the new 
³work² of Entente diplomacy. Evidently, Mr. Petlura, 
who only yesterday was brandishing the sword of ³independence,² 
is today inclining in favour of the forces of the 
Entente, that is, of Krasnov and Denikin, which are 
³coming² to his aid. The insurrectionary troops and the 
Soviets are proclaimed to be the chief enemy of the 
Ukraine. And the chief friend is the ³welcome guest²‹the 
Entente and its friends, the Krasnov and Denikin whiteguards, 
who have already occupied the Donets Basin. 
Having sold the Ukraine once to the Germans, Mr. Petlura 
is now selling i t again to the British imperialists. 
Needless to say, the Ukrainian workers and peasants will 
take account of this new act of treachery on the part of 
Vinnichenko and Petlura. The rapidly growing revolutionary 
movement in the Ukraine and the process of disintegration 
which has already begun in the ranks of Petlura¹s 
army are sufficiently convincing evidence of this. 
Things are moving. . . .

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 
FROM THE EASTERN FRONT49 
To Comrade Lenin, 
Chairman of the Council of Defence. 
The investigation has begun. We shall keep you 
regularly informed of its progress. Meanwhile we consider 
it necessary to bring one urgent need of the Third 
Army to your attention. The fact is that of the Third 
Army (more than 30,000 men), there remain only about 
11,000 weary and battered soldiers who can scarcely 
contain the enemy¹s onslaught. The units sent by the 
Commander-in-Chief are unreliable, in part even hostile 
and require thorough sifting. To save the remnants of 
the Third Army and to prevent a swift enemy advance on 
Vyatka (according to all reports from the command of the 
front and the Third Army, this is a very real danger 
it is absolutely essential urgently to transfer at least 
three thoroughly reliable regiments from Russia and place 
them at the disposal of the army commander. We urgently 
request you to exert pressure on the appropriate

REPORT TO V. I. LENIN 
To Comrade Lenin. 
We have received your ciphered telegram. We have 
already informed you of the reasons for the catastrophe 
as revealed by the investigation:50 an army with fatigued 
units and with no reserves nor a firm command, and, 
moreover, occupying a flank position open to envelopment 
from the North‹such an army could not but collapse in 
the face of a serious assault of superior and fresh enemy 
forces. In our opinion, the trouble lay not only in 
the weakness of the Third Army agencies and the immediate 
rear, but also 
1) In the General Staff and the Area Military 
Commissariats, which formed and sent to the front units 
which were patently unreliable; 
2) In the All-Russian Commissars Bureau, which 
supplied the units being formed in the rear with callow 
youths, not commissars; 
3) In the Revolutionary Military Council of the 
Republic, whose so-called instructions and orders disorganized 
the control of the front and the armies. Unless 
the necessary changes are made at central headquarters, 
there can be no guarantee of success at the 
fronts. 
Here are our replies to the military.

REPORT TO V. I. LENIN 195 
1. The two regiments. Two regiments surrendered: 
the 1st Soviet and a regiment of sailors from Petrograd. 
They did not begin any hostile actions against 
us. It was the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the 10th Division 
stationed in the village of Ilyinskoye, which had been 
formed by the Ural Area Military Commissariat, that 
started hostile actions. Further, we managed to forestall 
a mutiny of the 10th Regiment of Engineers, stationed at 
Ochersky Zavod, which had also been formed by the Area 
Military Commissariat. The reason for the desertions 
to the enemy, as well as for the hostile actions, was 
the counter-revolutionary spirit of the regiments, which 
is to be attributed to the old methods of mobilization 
and formation, under which no preliminary sifting was 
made of the men called up for service, and also to the 
absence of even a minimum of political educational 
work in the regiments. 
2. Motovilikha. The machinery of the plant and 
the equipment of the electrical shop were dismantled 
and inventorized in proper time and loaded on rail; 
but they were not moved out, nor were they destroyed. 
The responsibility lies with the Central Collegium,51 
the chief transportation officer and the Revolutionary 
Military Council of the army, which displayed 
incredible mismanagement. Five-sixths of Motovilikha¹s 
workers were left behind in Perm, as also were the entire 
technical staff of the plant and its raw materials. According 
to available information, the plant can be restarted 
in about a month and a half. Rumours of a revolt 
of the Motovilikha workers on the eve of the fall of 
Perm are not confirmed; there was only serious unrest 
due to bad food supply.

J. V. S T A L I N 196 
3. Demolition of the bridge and valuable installations. 
The bridge, etc., were not blown up owing to mismanagement 
on the part of the Revolutionary Military 
Council of the army and lack of liaison between the 
retreating units and army headquarters. It is asserted 
that the comrade whose duty it was to blow up the bridge 
could not accomplish his mission because he was killed by 
whiteguards a few minutes before the charge was to be 
fired. It has been impossible so far to verify this version 
because of the flight of the bridge guards and the 
departure of a whole number of ³Soviet² officials ³no 
one knows whereto.² 
4. Reserves at Perm. The reserves consisted of one 
still weak and unreliable ³Soviet regiment,² which upon 
its arrival at the front immediately went over to the 
enemy. There were no other reserves. 
5. Losses of matériel and men. It is still impossible 
to construct a full picture of the losses because of the 
disappearance of a number of documents and the desertion 
to the enemy of a number of the ³Soviet² specialists 
concerned. 
According to the scanty data available, our losses 
were: 297 locomotives (of which, 86 in disrepair), 
about 3,000 railway wagons (probably more), 900,000 poods 
of oil and paraffin, several hundred thousand poods of 
caustic soda, two million poods of salt, five million 
rubles¹ worth of medical supplies, the storehouses of the 
Motovilikha plant and the Perm railwayshops with the 
vast amount of materials they contained, the machinery 
and parts of the Motovilikha plant, the machinery of the 
steamers of the Kama flotilla, 65 wagon-loads of leather, 
150 wagon-loads of food belonging to the army supply

REPORT TO V. I. LENIN 197 
division, the huge warehouse of the District- Water 
Transport Board containing cotton wool, textiles, mineral 
oil, etc., ten cars of wounded, the axle stores 
of the railways which included large stocks of American 
axles, 29 guns, 10,000 shells, 2,000 rifles, 8 million 
cartridges; over 8,000 men killed, wounded or missing 
in the period December 22 to 29. The railway specialists 
and practically all the supply specialists have remained 
in Perm. The counting of losses continues. 
6. Present fighting strength of the army. The Third 
Army consists at present of two divisions (29th and 
30th), with 14,000 bayonets and 3,000 sabres, 323 
machine guns and 78 guns. Reserves: a brigade of the 
7th Division sent from Russia which has not yet been 
sent into action because of its unreliability and need 
of thorough sifting. The three regiments promised by 
Vatsetis have not yet arrived (and will not, because 
yesterday, it appears, they were redirected to Narva).52 
The units in action are battered and worn out and are 
holding their positions with difficulty. 
7. Control system of the Third Army. Outwardly, 
the system of control seems the usual one and ³according 
to the manual.² Actually, there is no system at 
all‹the administration is utterly incompetent, has no 
liaison with the combat area, and the divisions are 
virtually autonomous. 
8. Have adequate measures been taken to halt the 
retreat? Of the measures taken, the following may be considered 
of serious value: 1) advance of the Second Army 
towards Kungur, which is undoubtedly of great support 
to the Third Army, and 2) the dispatch to the front, 
thanks to the efforts of Stalin and Dzerzhinsky, of 900

J. V. S T A L I N 198 
fresh and fully reliable bayonets with the object of raising 
the fallen morale of the Third Army. Within a couple 
of days we shall dispatch to the front two squadrons 
of cavalry and the 62nd Regiment of the 3rd Brigade 
(already sifted). Another regiment will be leaving in ten 
days. The front of the Third Army knows this and sees 
the solicitude of the rear, and its morale is stiffening. 
Without a doubt, the situation is better than it was a 
fortnight ago. In places the army is even assuming the 
offensive, and not without success. If the enemy allows 
us another couple of weeks¹ respite, that is, if he does 
not bring up fresh forces to the front, there is hope that 
a stable situation will be created in the Third Army¹s 
area. 
We are at present engaged in liquidating a northern 
enveloping movement of several enemy detachments in 
the direction of Vyatka, along the road that runs 
through Kaigorod. One reason, incidentally, why we 
have come to Vyatka is to send a ski detachment to 
Kaigorod, which we shall do. As to other measures 
(for strengthening the rear), we are mobilizing personnel, 
rank-and-file and otherwise, and appointing them 
to the army units in the rear, and are purging the 
Glazov and Vyatka Soviets. But, of course, the results of 
this work will not make themselves felt for some time. 
This exhausts the measures taken. They can by no 
means be considered adequate, because the weary units 
of the Third Army cannot hold on for long without at 
least partial replacement. It is therefore necessary to 
send us at least two regiments. Only then may the stability 
of the front be considered guaranteed. Apart from 
this, it is necessary:

REPORT TO V. I. LENIN 199 
1) To replace the army commander; 
2) To send three efficient political workers; 
3) To dissolve immediately the Regional Party 
Committee, Regional Soviet, etc., with a view to the 
speedy mobilization of the evacuated officials.

SPEECH 
DELIVERED AT A JOINT MEETING 
OF PARTY AND SOVIET ORGANISATIONS 
IN VYATKA 
January 19, 1919 
(Record in the Minutes) 
As to the general situation, it should be said that 
for the immediate future a certain stability at the 
front is assured and it is just now that a Revolutionary 
Military Committee of the Vyatka Gubernia must be 
formed. If the enemy advances, he will have the aid of 
counter-revolutionary revolts from within, which can 
only be coped with by a small and mobile organization 
such as the Revolutionary Military Committee 
should be. 
It is necessary at once to form a new centre, comprising 
representatives of: 
1) The Gubernia Executive Committee; 
2) The Regional Soviet; 
3) The Gubernia Party Committee; 
4) The Extraordinary Commission; 
5) The Area Military Commissariat. 
All forces and resources must be concentrated in the 
hands of the Vyatka Revolutionary Military Committee. 
However, the current work of the Soviet bodies should 
not be suspended; on the contrary, it must be intensified.

SPEECH AT A JOINT MEETING 201 
Similar organs must be formed in the uyezds, on the 
same pattern as the gubernia centre. 
Given such a network of revolutionary committees, 
contact with the localities will be assured. 
And only then shall we be ready for a new offensive. 
Comrade Stalin formulated his proposal as follows: 
With the object of strengthening and securing the 
rear and uniting the activities of all the Soviet and 
Party organizations of the Vyatka Gubernia, a Vyatka 
Revolutionary Military Committee shall be set up, the 
decisions of which, as the highest organ of Soviet power 
in the gubernia, shall be binding on the above-mentioned 
institutions and organizations.

REPORT TO COMRADE LENIN 
BY THE COMMISSION 
OF THE PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
AND THE COUNCIL OF DEFENCE 
ON THE REASONS FOR THE FALL 
OF PERM IN DECEMBER 1918 
GENERAL PICTURE OF THE DISASTER 
That disaster was inevitable was already apparent 
towards the end of November, when the enemy, after 
having surrounded the Third Army in a semi-circle along a 
line stretching from Nadezhdinsky, through Verkhoturye, 
Baranchinsky, Kyn, Irginsky and Rozhdestvensky, to 
the left bank of the Kama, and making strong demonstrations 
on his right flank, launched a fierce attack on 
Kushva. 
The Third Army at that time consisted of the 30th 
Division, the 5th Division, a Special Brigade, a Special 
Detachment and the 29th Division, totalling about 35,000 
bayonets and sabres, with 571 machine guns and 115 
guns (see ³Order of Battle²). 
The morale and efficiency of the army were deplorable, 
owing to the weariness of the units, the result of six 
months of continuous fighting without relief. There were 
no reserves whatever. The rear was totally insecure (a 
series of demolitions of the railway track in the rear of the 
army). The food supply of the army was haphazard and 
uncertain (at the most difficult moment, when a furious

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 203 
assault was launched against the 29th Division, its units 
were in action for five days literally without bread or 
other food). 
Although it occupied a flank position, the Third 
Army was not secured against envelopment from the 
North (no measures were taken to post a special group 
of units on the army¹s extreme left flank to guard it 
against envelopment). As to the extreme right flank, 
the neighbouring army, the Second, being immobilized 
by a vague directive from the Commander-in-Chief 
(not to involve the Second Army in action after the 
capture of Izhevsk and Votkinsk, because it was to be 
given another assignment), and compelled to remain 
immobile for ten days, was not in a position to render 
timely support to the Third Army by advancing at the 
most crucial moment, before the surrender of Kushva 
(close of November). 
Thus, left to its own devices (in the South) and open 
to enemy enveloping operations (in the North), weary 
and battered, without reserves and without the rear 
being at all secure, poorly fed (29th Division) and abominably 
shod (30th Division) at a time when the temperature 
stood at 35 degrees below zero, drawn out along 
a vast line stretching from Nadezhdinsky to the left 
bank of the Kama south of Osa (over 400 versts), and 
with a weak and inexperienced army headquarters, the 
Third Army could not, of course, withstand the onslaught 
of the enemy¹s superior and fresh forces (five divisions), 
which, in addition, were led by experienced commanders. 
On November 30 the enemy occupied Viya Station, 
severing our left flank from the centre, and annihilated 
practically the entire 3rd Brigade of the 29th Division

J. V. S T A L I N 204 
(only the brigade commander, the chief of staff and the 
commissar escaped; armoured train No. 9 fell into the 
enemy¹s hands). On December 1 the enemy occupied 
Krutoy Log Station in the Lysva sector and captured 
our armoured train No. 2. On December 3 the enemy 
occupied Kushvinsky Zavod (Verkhoturye and the whole 
northern area, being cut off from the centre, were evacuated 
by our forces). On December 7 the enemy occupied 
Biser. On December 9‹Lysva. Between December 12 
and 15‹Chusovskaya, Kalino and Selyanka Stations, 
the 1st Soviet Replacements Battalion going over to 
the side of the enemy. On December 20 the enemy occupied 
Valezhnaya Station. On December 21‹Gori and 
Mostovaya, the 1st Soviet Rifle Regiment deserting 
to the enemy. The enemy approached Motovilikha, with 
our forces in general retreat. On the night of the 24th-25th 
the enemy occupied Perm without a fight. The so-called 
artillery defence of the city proved a farce, leaving 29 
guns in the enemy¹s hands. 
Thus, in twenty days, the army in its disorderly 
retreat retired more than 300 versts, from Verkhoturye 
to Perm, losing in this period 18,000 men, scores of guns 
and hundreds of machine guns. (After the fall of Perm 
the Third Army consisted only of two divisions, with a 
total of 17,000 bayonets and sabres instead of 35,000, 
with 323 machine guns instead of 571, and 78 guns instead 
of 115. See ³Order of Battle.²) 
Strictly speaking, i t was not a retreat, still less 
could it be called an organized withdrawal of units to 
new positions; it was an absolutely disorderly flight of 
an utterly routed and completely demoralized army, with 
a staff which was neither capable of realizing what was

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 205 
happening nor of foreseeing the inevitable disaster, 
incapable, too, of adopting timely measures to preserve 
the army by withdrawing it to prepared positions, even 
at the price of territory. The noisy laments of the Revolutionary 
Military Council and Third Army headquarters 
that the disaster was a ³surprise² only prove that 
these institutions were out of touch with the army, 
had no inkling of the fatal significance of the events 
at Kushva and Lysva, and were incapable of directing 
the army¹s actions. 
All these factors account for the unparalleled confusion 
and inefficiency which characterized the absolutely 
disorderly evacuation of a number of towns and 
places in the area of the Third Army, the shameful 
affair about the demolition of the bridge and destruction 
of the abandoned property, and, lastly, the matter of the 
guarding of the city and of its so-called artillery defence. 
Although talk of evacuation had already begun in 
August, nothing, or nearly nothing, was done for its 
practical organization. Nobody, not a single organization, 
attempted to call to order the Central Collegium, 
which got in the way of the institutions, engaged in 
endless debates on a plan of evacuation, but did nothing, 
absolutely nothing, to arrange for the evacuation (it 
did not even prepare a list of ³its own freight²). 
Nobody, not a single institution, attempted to establish 
effective control over the Ural Railway Administration, 
which proved suspiciously incapable of combating 
the skilfully organized sabotage of railway personnel. 
The appointment of chief transportation officer 
Stogov as chief of evacuation on December 12 did not

J. V. S T A L I N 206 
advance the work of evacuation one iota, because, despite 
his solemn pledge to evacuate Perm without delay 
(³I pledge my head that everything will be evacuated²), 
Stogov had no plan of evacuation, no evacuation staff, 
and no military force with which to curb the disorderly 
and unauthorized attempts at ³evacuation² on the part of 
individual institutions and disorganized military units 
(seizure of locomotives, wagons, etc.). The result was that 
all sorts of rubbish‹broken chairs and similar lumber‹ 
were evacuated, while trains already loaded with machinery 
and parts of the Motovilikha plant and the Kama 
flotilla, trains carrying wounded soldiers or precious 
American axles, and hundreds of sound locomotives 
and other valuables remained unevacuated. 
The Regional Party Committee, the Regional Soviet, 
and the Revolutionary Military Council and army headquarters 
could not but know all this, but evidently they 
³refrained from interfering,² since the investigation 
reveals that these institutions did not exercise systematic 
control over the activities of the evacuation agencies. 
Already in October army headquarters began to talk 
of arranging an artillery defence of Perm. But it went no 
farther than talk, because 26 guns (plus another 3 which 
were not in proper working order), with all their horses and 
harness were left to the enemy without a single shot having 
been fired. The investigation shows that if headquarters 
had taken the trouble to check what the brigade commander 
was doing in regard to placing the guns, it would 
have realized that, in view of the disorderly retreat of the 
military units and the general state of disorganization 
on the eve of the fall of Perm (December 23), and in view 
of the fact that the brigade commander, in disobedience of

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 207 
orders, had postponed the emplacement of the guns until 
the 24th (this brigade commander deserted to the enemy 
on the 24th), the only thing to be done was to save the 
guns themselves by removing them, or at least to put 
them out of action, but that there certainly could be no 
question of an artillery defence. That neither of these 
things was done can only be attributed to the negligence 
and inefficiency of headquarters. 
Similar inefficiency and mismanagement is to be discerned 
in the matter of the demolition of the Kama 
bridge and the destruction of the property left behind 
in Perm. The bridge had been mined several months 
before Perm fell, but the mining was not checked by 
anybody (no one undertakes to affirm that the charge 
was in full working order the day before the bridge was 
to be blown up). The discharge of the mine was entrusted 
to a ³fully reliable² comrade (Medvedyev), but no one 
undertakes to affirm that the bridge guards were fully 
reliable, that they stood by Medvedyev up to the last 
minute when the charge was to be fired, that Medvedyev 
was fully protected by the guards against attack on the 
part of whiteguard agents. It is therefore impossible to 
establish: 
1) Whether (as some assert) Medvedyev really was 
killed by whiteguard agents just before the charge was 
to be fired, when the bridge guards fled ³no one knows 
whereto²; 
2) Whether Medvedyev himself ran away because 
he did not want to blow up the bridge; 
3) Or whether, perhaps, Medvedyev did all in his power 
to blow up the bridge, but it was not blown up because 
the wiring was defective, or the charges were damaged,

J. V. S T A L I N 208 
perhaps by the fire of the enemy, who was shelling the 
bridge, or perhaps before the shelling, Medvedyev being 
killed maybe later when the enemy arrived on the scene. 
Further, the Revolutionary Military Council and 
army headquarters had made no attempt to assign to any 
precise and definite agency or individual the task of 
destroying the unevacuated property. More, these institutions 
were not found to have formal (written) orders 
making compulsory the destruction or demolition of 
the abandoned installations and property. This explains 
why property mostly of minor value (railway wagons, 
for instance) was destroyed (burned), on the initiative 
of individuals, while very valuable property (textiles, 
uniforms, etc.) was left untouched. Moreover, the burning 
or blowing up of unevacuated property was forbidden 
by certain official persons, ostensibly in order 
to ³prevent panic² (these persons have not been found). 
To this picture of general disruption and disorganization 
of the army and the rear, and mismanagement and 
irresponsibility on the part of army, Party and Soviet 
institutions, must be added the incredible, almost wholesale 
desertion of responsible officials to the enemy. Banin, 
the engineer in charge of the defence works, and all his 
staff, railway engineer Adrianovsky and all the experts 
of the area railway administration, Sukhorsky, chief 
of army transportation, and his staff, Bukin, chief of 
mobilization of the Area Military Commissariat, and 
his staff, Ufimtsev, commander of the guard battalion, 
Valyuzhenich, commander of the artillery brigade, Eskin, 
chief of special formations, the commander of the engineer 
battalion and his second-in-command, the commandants 
of Perm I and Perm II Stations, the entire accountant¹s

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 209 
division of the army supply department, half the members 
of the Central Collegium‹all these and many others 
remained in Perm and went over to the side of the enemy. 
All this could not but increase the general panic 
that seized not only the retreating units but even the 
Revolutionary Committee which had been set up on the 
eve of the fall of Perm and which had failed to maintain 
revolutionary order in the city, and the Gubernia Military-
Commissariat, which lost contact with the various 
parts of the city, resulting in the non-withdrawal 
from Perm of two companies of the guard battalion, who 
were afterwards massacred by the Whites, and the loss 
of a ski battalion, who were also slaughtered by the 
Whites. The provocative firing skilfully organized 
by White agents in various parts of the city (December 
23 and 24) added to and enhanced the general 
panic.

THE THIRD ARMY AND THE RESERVES 
The weariness of the Third Army (six months of 
continuous fighting without relief) and the lack of any 
reliable reserves were the immediate causes of the 
defeat. Drawn out in a thin line 400 versts long, and 
liable to envelopment from the North, which compelled 
it to extend the line still further northward, the Third 
Army presented a most convenient target for enemy penetration 
at any point. All this, as well as the lack of 
reserves, was known to the Revolutionary Military 
Councils of the Eastern Front and the Republic already 
in September (see, in the ³Appendix,² the telegrams

J. V. S T A L I N 210 
of responsible officers of the Third Army demanding ³replacements² 
and ³reserves,² reporting the weariness of 
the Third Army¹s units, etc.), but Central Headquarters 
either sent no reserves at all, or sent small contingents 
of worthless troops. The demands for replacements and 
references to the weariness of the army became particularly 
frequent after the loss of Kushva in the early part 
of December. On December 6 Lashevich (army commander) 
appealed to the Eastern Front for reserves, pleading 
the hopelessness of the situation, but Smilga (Eastern 
Front) replied: ³Unfortunately, reinforcements cannot 
be sent.² On December 11 Trifonov, member of the 
Revolutionary Military Council of the Third Army, 
informed Smilga (Eastern Front) over the direct wire: 
³It is very probable that we shall be forced to abandon 
Perm in the next few days. All we need is two or three 
firm regiments. Try to secure them from Vyatka or 
some nearby point.² Reply of Smilga (Eastern Front): 
³Reinforcements cannot be sent. Commander-in-Chief declines 
to help.² (See ³Appendix.²) In the period August- 
December 13,153 men in all, with 3,388 bayonets, 
134 machine guns, 22 guns and 977 horses, arrived as 
reinforcements for the Third Army on orders from the 
centre. Of these, the 1st Kronstadt Regiment of Marines 
(1,248 men) surrendered to the enemy, the 11th Separate 
Marines Battalion (834 men) deserted, the 5th Field 
Battery of the Kronstadt Fortress were placed under 
arrest for brutally killing their commander, and the Finns 
and Estonians (1,214 men) were recalled to the West. 
As to the indents for 22 companies promised by the 
centre, the latter simply did nothing about them. And the 
3rd Brigade of the 7th Division (three regiments) promised

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 211 
by the centre arrived in Glazov only in the early part 
of January, when Perm had already fallen. Moreover, 
the very first acquaintance with the brigade was enough 
to show that it had no place in the Red Army (a 
distinctly counter-revolutionary attitude, disaffection 
towards the Soviet power, existence within the brigade 
of a solid group of kulak elements, threats to ³surrender 
Vyatka,² etc.). Furthermore, the brigade was not 
ready for action (no firing skill, baggage train of the 
summer type), the commanders were unacquainted with 
their regiments, and political educational work was 
negligible. Only towards the end of January, after three 
or four weeks of purging and thorough sifting of the 
brigade and strongly reinforcing it with Communists as 
rank-and-file Red Army men, and after intensive political 
educational work, was it converted into a competent 
fighting unit (of its three regiments, one was sent to the 
front on January 20, the second can be sent not earlier 
than January 30, and the third not earlier than February 
10). Further evidence of these same shortcomings in 
our system of formation is the case of the 10th Cavalry 
Regiment and the 10th Regiment of Engineers stationed 
at Ochersky Zavod (they were both formed by the Ural 
Area Military Commissariat), the first of which attacked 
our units in the rear, and the second tried to do so too, 
but unsuccessfully, because of the precautionary measures 
taken. 
The shortcomings in the system of formation are due 
to the following circumstances: down to the end of May 
the Red Army was formed on the voluntary principle 
(under the direction of the All-Russian Formation Board), 
enlistment being confined to workers and peasants who

J. V. S T A L I N 212 
did not exploit the labour of others (see ³Certificate Card² 
and ³Personal Card² drawn up by the All-Russian Formation 
Board). This, possibly, is one of the reasons for the 
staunchness of the formations of the volunteer period. 
When the All-Russian Formation Board was dissolved 
at the end of May and the work of formation turned over 
to the All-Russian General Staff, the picture changed for 
the worse. The All-Russian General Staff took over in its 
entirety the system of formation which prevailed in 
tsarist days, and enrolled for Red Army service all mobilized 
men regardless of their property status. The points 
concerning the property status of mobilized men contained 
in the ³Personal Card² of the All-Russian Formation 
Board were not included in the ³Personal and Record 
Card² drawn up by the All-Russian General Staff (see 
³Personal and Record Card² of the All-Russian General 
Staff). True, on June 12, 1918, the Council of People¹s 
Commissars issued the first decree on the mobilization of 
workers and peasants who do not exploit the labour of others, 
but it was evidently not reflected in the practical work 
of the All-Russian General Staff, nor in its orders, 
nor in the ³Personal and Record Card.² This chiefly 
explains why it was that the result of the work of our 
formation agencies was not so much a Red Army as a 
³popular army.² Only in mid-January, when the Commission 
of the Council of Defence pressed the Ural 
Area Military Commissariat to the wall and demanded 
all documents and orders of the General Staff relative 
to methods of formation‹only then did the All-Russian 
General Staff find time to give serious thought to the 
system of formation and it issued the telegraphic order 
to all Area Military Commissariats: ³Fill in points 14,

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 213 
15 and 16 of the personal and record cards, indicating 
party affiliation (of the recruit), whether he exploits 
the labour of others, and whether he has been through 
a general training course² (this telegraphic order of 
the General Staff was sent out on January 18, 1919. See 
³Appendix²). And this after eleven divisions were 
considered formed already by December 1, and part of 
them, already dispatched to the front, had displayed all 
the signs of being whiteguard formations. 
The defects in the system of formation were aggravated 
by the amazing negligence of the Area Military 
Commissariat in regard to the maintenance of the new 
formations (wretched food and clothing, no bathhouses, 
etc. See ³Testimony of the Commission of Inquiry of 
the Vyatka Party Committee²), and by the absolutely 
indiscriminate appointment of unverified officers as 
commanders, many of whom lured their units over to the 
enemy. 
Lastly, the General Staff did not see to i t that 
men mobilized in one locality should be transferred for 
formation to another locality (in a different military 
area), which would have substantially checked mass desertion. 
We say nothing about the absence of any satisfactory 
political educational work in the units (weakness 
and incompetence of the All-Russian Commissars Bureau). 
It is quite understandable that such semi-whiteguard 
reserves, as far as the centre sent them at all (half 
of them usually deserted on the way), could not be of 
any material support to the Third Army. Yet the units 
of the Third Army were so fatigued and worn out that 
during the retreat soldiers would lie down in whole

J. V. S T A L I N 214 
groups in the snow and beg their commissars to shoot 
them: ³We can¹t stand on our feet, let alone march. 
We¹re worn out. Put us out of our misery, comrades.² 
(See ³Testimony of Divisional Commissar Mrachkovsky.²) 
CONCLUSIONS 
This practice of fighting without reserves must be 
stopped. A system of permanent reserves must be introduced, 
otherwise it will be impossible either to maintain 
present positions, or to exploit successes. Without 
this, disaster will be inevitable. 
B u t reserves can be of value only if the old system 
of mobilization and formation practised by the General 
Staff is radically amended, and the composition of the 
General Staff itself is changed. 
It is necessary, firstly, that mobilized men be divided 
strictly into propertied men (unreliable) and nonpropertied 
men (who are alone suitable for Red Army 
service). 
It is necessary, secondly, that men mobilized in 
one locality should be transferred for formation to another 
locality, and that the principle in dispatching men 
to the front should be: ³the further from their home gubernia, 
the better² (abandonment of the territorial principle). 
It is necessary, thirdly, to discard the practice of 
forming large, unwieldy units (divisions), which are 
unfitted for conditions of civil war, and to lay down 
that the maximum combat unit should be the brigade. 
It is necessary, fourthly, to establish strict continuous 
control over those Area Military Commissariats

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 215 
(first replacing their personnel), which evoke indignation 
among the Red Army men (mass desertion at the 
best) by their criminal negligence in the matter of billeting, 
victualling and outfitting the units under formation. 
It is necessary, lastly, to replace the personnel of 
the All-Russian Commissars Bureau, which supplies the 
military units with whipper-snapper ³commissars² who 
are quite incapable of organizing political educational 
work on any satisfactory basis. 
As a result of non-observance of these conditions, 
what our formation agencies are sending to the front is 
not so much a Red Army as a ³popular army,² and the 
word ³commissar² has become a term of opprobrium. 
In particular, if the fighting efficiency of the Third 
Army is to be preserved, it is absolutely essential to 
supply it at once with reserves to the extent of at least 
three reliable regiments.

CONTROL SYSTEM OF THE ARMY 
AND INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CENTRE 
The Revolutionary Military Council of the Third 
Army consists of two men, one of whom (Lashevich) 
commands, and as to the other (Trifonov), we have failed 
to discover either what his functions are, or what he 
is actually doing: he does not look after supply, he does 
not look after the political education services of the 
army, and generally he does not seem to be doing anything 
whatever. In point of fact, there is no Revolutionary 
Military Council at all.

J. V. S T A L I N 216 
Army headquarters has no contact with its combat 
area; it has no special representatives in the divisions 
and brigades to keep it informed and to see to it that the 
orders of the army commander are strictly obeyed by 
the commanders of divisions and brigades; army headquarters 
contents itself with the official reports (often 
inaccurate) of the division and brigade commanders; it 
is completely in their hands (they behave like feudal 
princes). This accounts for army headquarters¹ lack of 
liaison with its combat area (it knows nothing about the 
real state of affairs there) and the lack of centralized 
control within the army (constant wailing of army headquarters 
regarding the weakness of the junctions between 
the army¹s combat units). Centralized control is lacking 
not only within the army, but also between the various 
armies of the front (Eastern). It is a fact that from 
the 10th to the end of November, when the Third 
Army was shedding its blood in unequal combat, its 
neighbour, the Second Army, remained immobile for 
two whole weeks. Yet it is clear that if the Second Army, 
which had completed the Izhevsk-Votkinsk operation on 
November 10, had advanced (which it could have done 
quite easily, because at that time there were no enemy 
forces opposing it, or practically none), the enemy could 
not even have started any serious operation against 
Perm (since his rear would have been threatened by the 
Second Army), and the Third Army would have been 
saved. 
The investigation has revealed that the lack of coordination 
between the Second and Third Armies was 
due to the isolation of the Revolutionary Military 
Council of the Republic from the front and the ill-con

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 217 
sidered instructions of the Commander-in-Chief. Front 
Commander Kamenev, when interrogated by us, had the 
following to say in this connection: 
³Before the capture of Izhevsk and Votkinsk, in the early 
part of November, not later than the 10th, we had received instructions 
that after the capture of these points the Second Army 
was to be transferred to another front, the exact location not being 
specified. Having received such an instruction, the army could 
not be adequately used; it could not be brought into contact with 
the enemy, otherwise it would have been impossible to disengage 
it in time. The situation meanwhile was very serious, yet the 
army confined itself to clearing the area of whiteguard bands. 
It was not before Shternberg and Sokolnikov interceded and went 
to Serpukhov that the instruction was rescinded. But this took 
ten days. Ten days were thus wasted, during which the army was 
forced to remain immobile. Then the sudden summons of Shorin, 
commander of the Second Army, to Serpukhov paralysed the Second 
Army, which was linked with his personality, and forced it to 
remain immobile for another five days. In Serpukhov, Shorin was 
received by Kostyaev, who asked him whether he was a General 
Staff officer, and on learning that he was not, dismissed him, 
saying that it had been intended to appoint him assistant commander 
of the Southern Front but they Œhad thought better of it¹² 
(see ³Statement of the Commander of the Eastern Front²). 
It is necessary in general to draw attention to the unpardonable 
thoughtlessness with which the Commanderin-
Chief issues instructions. Gusev, member of the Revolutionary 
Military Council of the Eastern Front, states 
(December 26): ³Recently the Eastern Front received 
three telegraphic instructions in the space of five days: 
1) Main direction‹Orenburg. 2) Main direction‹Yekaterinburg. 
3) Go to the support of the Third Army² 
(see Gusev¹s letter to the C.C., R.C.P.). Bearing in mind 
that every new instruction requires a certain amount

J. V. S T A L I N 218 
of time to execute, it will be easily seen how light-minded 
was the attitude of the Revolutionary Military Council 
of the Republic and the Commander-in-Chief towards 
their own instructions. 
It should be stated that the third member of the 
Revolutionary Military Council of the Eastern Front, 
Smilga, fully associates himself with the statements 
of the other two members, Kamenev and Gusev. (See 
³Smilga¹s Testimony,² January 5.) 
CONCLUSIONS 
The army cannot do without a strong Revolutionary 
Military Council. Its Revolutionary Military Council 
should consist of at least three members, one of whom 
supervises the army¹s supply services, the second its 
political education services, and the third commands. 
Only in this way can the army function properly. 
Army headquarters must not content itself with the 
official reports (not infrequently inaccurate) of the 
commanders of divisions and brigades; it must have its 
representatives‹agents who keep it regularly informed 
and are keenly alert to see that the orders of the army 
commander are strictly observed. Only in this way can 
contact between headquarters and army be assured, the 
virtual autonomy of divisions and brigades abolished, 
and effective centralized control of the army established. 
An army cannot operate as a self-contained and absolutely 
autonomous unit. In its operations it is entirely 
dependent on the armies adjacent to it, and above all on 
the instructions of the Revolutionary Military Council 
of the Republic. Other things being equal, the most

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 219 
efficient army may suffer disaster if the instructions 
of the centre are faulty and if effective contact with 
the adjacent armies is lacking. It is necessary to establish 
on the fronts, and on the Eastern Front in the first 
place, a system of strictly centralized control of operations 
of the various armies for the execution of a 
definite and thoroughly thought-out strategic directive. 
Arbitrary or ill-considered defining of instructions, and 
failure to pay serious heed to all the factors involved, 
with the consequent rapid change of instructions and 
the vagueness of the instructions themselves, as is the 
case with the Revolutionary Military Council of the 
Republic, makes it impossible to direct the armies, 
results in loss of effort and time, and disorganizes the 
front. The Revolutionary Military Council of the Repub- 
Iic must be reformed into a narrow group, closely connected 
with the fronts and consisting, say, of five persons 
(two of them being experts, a third exercising supervision 
over the Central Supply Department, a fourth over 
the General Staff, and the fifth over the All-Russian 
Commissars Bureau), sufficiently experienced not to act 
arbitrarily and light-mindedly in the control of the 
armies.

INSECURITY OF THE REAR AND WORK 
OF THE PARTY AND SOVIET INSTITUTIONS 
The investigation reveals that the rear of the Third 
Army was completely disrupted. The army was forced to 
fight on two fronts: against the enemy, whom it at any 
rate knew and could see, and against elusive inhabitants

J. V. S T A L I N 220 
in the rear who, under the direction of whiteguard 
agents, blew up railway tracks and created all sorts of 
difficulties, so much so that the railway in the rear of 
the army had to be guarded by a special armoured train. 
All the Party and Soviet institutions are unanimous 
in affirming that the population of the Perm and 
Vyatka gubernias are ³solidly counter-revolutionary.² The 
Regional Party Committee and Regional Soviet, as well 
as the Perm Gubernia Executive Committee and Gubernia 
Party Committee assert that the villages in this area 
are ³solidly kulak.² When we remarked that there were 
no such things as solidly kulak villages, that the existence 
of kulaks without exploited is inconceivable, 
since kulaks must have somebody to exploit, the abovementioned 
institutions shrugged their shoulders and 
declined to give any other explanation. Further and more 
thorough investigation has revealed that the Soviets 
contain unreliable elements, that the Committees of 
Poor Peasants are controlled by kulaks, that the Party 
organizations are weak, unreliable and isolated from 
the centre, that Party work is neglected, and that the 
local functionaries endeavour to compensate for the 
general weakness of the Party and Soviet institutions 
by intensifying the activities of the Extraordinary 
Commissions, which, in view of the general breakdown 
of Party and Soviet work, have become the sole 
representatives of Soviet power in the provinces. Only 
the wretchedness of the work of the Soviet and Party 
organizations, which lacked even a minimum of guidance 
from the Central Executive Committee (or the People¹s 
Commissariat of Home Affairs) and the Central Committee 
of the Party, can explain the amazing fact that the

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 221 
revolutionary decree on the extraordinary tax,53 which 
was designed to drive a wedge in the countryside 
and rouse the poor peasants in support of Soviet power, 
was turned into a most dangerous weapon of the kulaks, 
used by them to unite the countryside against 
the Soviet power (as a rule, on the initiative of the 
kulaks ensconced in the Committees of Poor Peasants, 
taxes were levied on a per capita instead of a property 
basis, which infuriated the poor peasants and facilitated 
the agitation of the kulaks against taxes and the 
Soviet power). Yet all the functionaries without exception 
confirm that the ³misunderstandings² arising in 
connection with the extraordinary tax were one of the 
principal factors, if not the only important one, which 
made the countryside counter-revolutionary. No guidance 
of the current work of the Soviet organizations on the part 
of the People¹s Commissariat of Home Affairs or the Central 
Executive Committee is to be observed (it is characteristic 
that by January 26 the re-election of the Committees 
of Poor Peasants in the Perm and Vyatka gubernias 
had not yet begun). Nor is any guidance of 
the current work of the Party organizations to be observed 
on the part of the Central Committee. All the 
time we have been at the front we have succeeded in 
unearthing only one document from the Central Committee 
of the Party. It orders the transfer of Comrade 
Korobovkin from Perm to Penza, and is signed by a 
³secretary² by the name of Novgorodtseva. (This order 
was not carried out because of its manifest inexpediency.) 
The result of all these circumstances was that the 
Party and Soviet institutions were deprived of backing

J. V. S T A L I N 222 
in the villages, lost contact with the poor peasants and 
began to place all their reliance in the Extraordinary 
Commissions and in repressive measures, under which 
the countryside is groaning. The Extraordinary Commissions 
themselves, inasmuch as their work was not supplemented 
by and conducted parallel with positive agitational 
and constructive work by the Party and Soviet 
institutions, fell into a state of complete and utter 
isolation, to the detriment of the prestige of the Soviet 
power. An ably conducted Party and Soviet press might 
have promptly brought the disease spots of our institutions 
to light; but the Perm and Vyatka Party and 
Soviet press is not distinguished either by ability in organizing 
its work or by its understanding of the current 
tasks of Soviet power (nothing but empty talk about 
a ³world social² revolution is to be found in it; the concrete 
tasks of Soviet power in the countryside, the reelection 
of the volost Soviets, the extraordinary tax, the 
aims of the war against Kolchak and the other whiteguards‹
all these are ³low² themes which the press 
proudly shuns). Consider the significance, for example, 
of the fact that of the 4,766 officials and employees of 
the Soviet institutions in Vyatka, 4,467 occupied the same 
posts in the gubernia rural administration in tsarist 
times; or, to put i t plainly, the old tsarist Zemstvo 
institutions have been simply re-named Soviet institutions 
(do not forget that these ³Soviet officials² control 
the entire leather-producing area of the Vyatka Gubernia). 
This striking fact was revealed by our questionnaire 
in mid-January. Did the Regional Party Committee 
and Regional Soviet, the local press and the local Party 
officials know about it? Of course, not. Did the Central

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 223 
Committee of the Party, the Central Executive Committee 
and the People¹s Commissariat of Home Affairs know 
about it? Of course, not. But how can the centre direct 
if it has no idea of the chief disease spots not only in 
the provinces generally, but even in our provincial 
Soviet institutions? 
CONCLUSIONS 
A severe handicap to our armies is the instability 
of the rear, which is mainly to be explained by neglect 
of Party work, inability of the Soviets to carry out 
the directives of the centre, and the abnormal (almost 
isolated) position of the local Extraordinary Commissions. 
In order to strengthen the rear it is necessary: 
1. To institute a strict system of regular reports 
from the local Party organizations to the Central Committee; 
to send regular circular letters of the Central 
Committee to the local Party organizations; to set up 
a press department of the Central Organ to direct the 
provincial Party press; to organize a school for training 
Party officials (mainly from workers) and arrange for 
the proper distribution of officials. All these measures 
should be entrusted to a Secretariat of the Party 
Central Committee to be organized within the Central 
Committee. 
2. Strictly to delimit the sphere of jurisdiction of 
the Central Executive Committee and the People¹s Commissariat 
of Home Affairs in the direction of the current 
work of the Soviets; to merge the All-Russian Extraordinary 
Commission with the People¹s Commissariat

J. V. S T A L I N 224 
of Home Affairs;* to make i t the duty of the People¹s 
Commissariat of Home Affairs to see that the decrees 
and orders of the central authority are correctly 
and promptly carried out by the Soviets; to make it the 
duty of the gubernia Soviets to present regular reports 
to the People¹s Commissariat of Home Affairs; to make 
i t the duty of the People¹s Commissariat of Home 
Affairs to issue the necessary regular instructions to the 
Soviets; to institute a press department of the Izvestia of 
the All-Russian Central Executive Committee54 to direct 
the provincial Soviet press. 
3. To set up a Control and Inspection Commission 
under the Council of Defence to investigate ³defects in 
the machinery² of the People¹s Commissariats and their 
corresponding local departments both in the rear and 
at the front.

SUPPLY AND EVACUATION AGENCIES 
The chief malady in the sphere of supply is the incredible 
overlapping of supply agencies and the lack of 
co-ordination between them. 
The army and the population of Perm received their 
food supplies from Ural Supply, Gubernia Supply, 
City Supply, the Uyezd Supply Boards and the Supply 
Department of the Third Army. For all that, the work 
of supply proceeded very badly, for the army (29th Division) 
starved and the population of Perm and the Moto-

Commission with the People¹s Commissariat of Home Affairs 
Comrade Dzerzhinsky expresses a dissenting opinion.

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 225 
vilikha workers went hungry, the bread ration having 
been systematically reduced until it dropped to starvation 
level (1/4 lb.). 
The confusion in supplying the army, due to lack 
of co-ordination among the above-mentioned supply 
agencies, is aggravated by the fact that the People¹s 
Commissariat of Food takes no account of the loss of 
the Perm Gubernia and s t i l l issues i t s indents for 
supplies to the Third Army on the Perm and other remote 
gubernias instead of transferring them to Vyatka. 
It should also be mentioned that the People¹s Commissariat 
of Food has not yet proceeded to haul grain 
to the river wharves, nor the Waterways Board to repair 
its steamers, and this undoubtedly may create serious 
complications in the matter of supply in the future. 
The supply of the army with munitions is suffering 
even more severely from the overlapping of agencies and 
from bureaucratic red tape. The Central Supply Department, 
the Central Ordnance Department, the Extraordinary 
Supply Commission and the Ordnance Division of the 
Third Army are continually getting into each other¹s 
way, hampering and preventing the active work of supply. 
In illustration, we consider it appropriate to quote some 
excerpts from a telegram sent by the Commander of 
the Third Army to the Commander of the Front (with a 
copy to Trotsky) on December 17, 1918, just before the fall 
of Perm: 
³Chief of Supply, Eastern Front, stated in his telegram No. 3249 
that an indent for six thousand Japanese rifles had been issued 
on the Yaroslavl Area. This indent, as may be seen from telegram 
No. 493 of Chief of Staff of the Military Council of the Republic 
Kostyaev, was endorsed by the Commander-in-Chief. A month

J. V. S T A L I N 226 
ago Third Army headquarters sent an agent to receive the rifles. 
On his arrival at the Yaroslavl Area Ordnance Department he 
wired that nothing was known there about the matter, since no 
order had been received from the Central Ordnance Department 
(C.O.D.). The agent proceeded to the C.O.D. in Moscow, and wired 
from there that the rifles could not be issued without the consent 
of the Commander-in-Chief. Yesterday we received a wire from the 
agent stating that C.O.D. categorically refused to issue the rifles 
and that he had returned. In his telegram No. 208 Chief of 
Supply of the Revolutionary Military Council stated that the 
Second Army had been ordered to deliver six thousand rifles to 
the Third Army, and Commander Second Army in his telegram 
No. 1560 requested that an agent be urgently sent to Izhevsk to 
receive the rifles. The agent was sent to Izhevsk, but he was not 
issued the rifles on the plea that no order had been received. Commander 
Second Army in his telegram No. 6542 and Chief of Supply 
Eastern Front in his telegram No. 6541 requested that the Izhevsk 
factory be ordered to release the rifles. Down to the 16th of this 
month no order had been sent to the factory, and according to 
information received from the agent all available rifles in Izhevsk 
are to be dispatched to the centre on Monday. Ten thousand rifles 
have thus been lost to the army on these two indents. The state 
of the army is well known. Replenishments cannot be sent to the 
front without rifles, and because of lack of replenishments the 
front is melting away, leading to the results with which you are 
familiar. The indent for rifles wad issued to the Yaroslavl Area 
Ordnance Department wi t h the consent of the Commanderin-
Chief, and Commander Third Army therefore officially accuses 
the C.O.D. of sabotage and insists upon an inquiry.² 
The substance of this telegram is fully corroborated 
by Front Commander Kamenev. (See ³Statements of the 
Commander of the Front.²) 
Similar confusion and overlapping of agencies reigned 
in the sphere of evacuation. The Area Chief of Railways 
proved totally incapable of checking the skilfully 
organized sabotage of railway personnel. Frequent train

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 227 
accidents, traffic jams and mysterious disappearances of 
freight needed by the army took the area administration 
by surprise at the most trying moments of the evacuation, 
yet i t did nothing, or was incapable of doing 
anything, to put an effective stop to the evil. The 
Central Collegium ³worked,² that is, debated, but took 
absolutely no measures for the orderly evacuation of 
freight. The chief transportation officer of the Third 
Army, who was also chief of evacuation, did absolutely 
nothing to get out the most valuable freight (machinery 
and parts of the Motovilikha plant, etc.). All 
sorts of rubbish was evacuated, and all organizations 
without exception had a finger in the work of evacuation, 
and the result was confusion and chaos. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In order to improve the supply of the army, it is 
necessary: 
1. To put an end to the overlapping of central army 
supply agencies (Central Supply Department, Extraordinary 
Supply Commission, Central Ordnance Department‹ 
each of which acts as it sees fit) and to reduce them to 
one, which should be held strictly accountable for the 
prompt fulfilment of indents. 
2. To instruct the army supply division to maintain 
a fortnight¹s supply of rations in reserve with each 
division. 
3. To instruct the People¹s Commissariat of Food 
to issue indents for the armies on gubernias in their 
immediate vicinity‹in particular, to transfer (promptly) 
its indents for the Third Army to the Vyatka Gubernia.

J. V. S T A L I N 228 
4. To instruct the People¹s Commissariat of Food 
to proceed immediately to haul grain to the river 
wharves, and the Waterways Board to proceed to repair 
its steamers. 
In order to ensure efficient evacuation, it is necessary: 
1. To abolish the local Central Collegiums. 
2. To set up under the Supreme Council of National 
Economy a single evacuation agency, with the right 
to allocate evacuated property. 
3. To instruct this agency, in case of need, to send 
special agents to direct the work of evacuation on the 
spot, always, as an indispensable condition, enlisting the 
co-operation of representatives of the military authorities 
and railway administration of the given area. 
4. To appoint to the various area railway administrations, 
especially of the Ural Area (in view 
of the unsatisfactory nature of its personnel) responsible 
agents of the People¹s Commissariat of Railways who 
will be capable of commanding the obedience of the 
railway experts and breaking the sabotage of railway 
personnel. 
5. To instruct the People¹s Commissariat of Railways 
to proceed immediately to transfer locomotives 
and wagons from areas where they are in abundance to 
the grain-growing areas, as well as to repair damaged 
locomotives.

TOTAL LOSSES OF MATÉRIEL AND MEN 
It is impossible to establish an exhaustive picture of 
the losses in view of the ³disappearance² of a number 
of documents and the desertion to the enemy of a whole 
number of Soviet officials and experts concerned. According 
to available data, our losses are: 419,000 cubic 
sazhens of wood fuel and 2,383,000 poods of coal, anthracite 
and peat; 66,800,000 poods of ore and other raw materials; 
5,000,000 poods of basic materials and products 
(cast iron, aluminium, tin, zinc, etc.); 6,000,000 poods 
of open-hearth and Bessemer ingots, bars and slabs; 
8,000,000 poods of iron and steel (structural steel, sheet 
iron, wire, rails, etc.); 4,000,000 poods of salt; 255,000 
poods of caustic and calcined soda; 900,000 poods of 
oil and paraffin; 5,000,000 rubles¹ worth of medical 
supplies; the storehouses of the Motovilikha plant and 
the Perm railway shops; the railway axle stores, including 
large stocks of American axles; the warehouses 
of the District Water Transport Board, containing cotton 
wool, textiles, mineral oil, nails, carts, etc.; 65 wagonloads 
of leather; 150 wagon-loads of food belonging to 
the army supply division; 297 locomotives (86 out of 
order); over 3,000 railway wagons; some 20,000 killed, 
captured and missing soldiers and 10 cars of wounded; 
37 guns, 250 machine guns, over 20,000 rifles, over

MEASURES TAKEN TO STRENGTHEN 
THE FRONT 
By January 15, 1,200 bayonets and sabres who could 
be relied on had been sent to the front; two squadrons 
of cavalry were dispatched two days later, and the 62nd 
Regiment of the 3rd Brigade (after thorough sifting) on 
the 20th. These units made it possible to halt the enemy¹s 
advance, wrought a complete change in the morale of the 
Third Army, and opened our advance on Perm, which 
so far is proceeding successfully. The 63rd Regiment 
of the same brigade (after having undergone a month¹s 
purge) will be sent to the front on January 30. The 
61st Regiment cannot be sent before February 10 (it 
needs very thorough sifting). In view of the weakness 
of the extreme left flank, open to the danger of being 
turned by the enemy, the ski battalion in Vyatka 
was reinforced with volunteers (1,000 in all), supplied 
with quick-firing guns and sent from Vyatka 
on January 28 in the direction of Cherdyn to link up 
with the extreme left flank of the Third Army. Another 
three reliable regiments must be sent from Russia to 
support the Third Army if its position is to be really 
strengthened and if it is to be able to exploit its 
successes. 
In the rear of the army a thorough purging of Soviet 
and Party institutions is under way. Revolutionary 
Committees have been formed in Vyatka and the uyezd 
towns. A start has been made in forming strong revolutionary 
organizations in the countryside, and this work 
i s continuing. All Party and Soviet work i s being 
re-organized on new lines. The military control agencies

REPORT TO LENIN BY COMMISSION OF C.C. 231 
have been purged and re-organized. The Gubernia Extraordinary 
Commission has been purged and reinforced 
with new Party workers. The congestion on the Vyatka 
railway line is being relieved. Experienced Party workers 
need to be sent and prolonged socialist work will 
be required before the rear of the Third Army is thoroughly 
strengthened. 
Concluding their report, the Commission considers 
it necessary to stress once again the absolute necessity 
for the establishment of a Control and Inspection 
Commission under the Council of Defence for the investigation 
of so-called ³defects in the machinery² of the 
People¹s Commissariats and their local departments in 
the rear and at the front. 
In correcting shortcomings in the work of the centre 
and the localities the Soviet power usually resorts to 
the method of disciplining and punishing offending 
officials. While recognizing that this method is absolutely 
necessary and fully expedient, the Commission, 
however, considers it insufficient. Shortcomings in work 
are due not only to the laxity, negligence and irresponsibility 
of some of the officials, but also to the inexperience 
of others. The Commission has found in the localities 
quite a number of absolutely honest, tireless and 
devoted officials who, nevertheless, committed a number 
of blunders in their work owing to insufficient experience. 
If the Soviet power had a special apparatus to accumulate 
the experience gained in the work of building the 
socialist state and to pass it on to the already existing 
young officials who are ardently desirous of helping

J. V. S T A L I N 232 
the proletariat, the building of a socialist Russia would 
proceed much faster and less painfully. This body 
should be the above-mentioned. Control and Inspection 
Commission under the Council of Defence. The activities 
of this Commission might supplement the work 
of the centre in tightening discipline among officials.

THE GOVERNMENT¹S POLICY 
ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
A year ago, and even before the October Revolution, 
Russia, as a state, presented a picture of disintegration. 
Side by side with the old ³boundless Russian Empire² 
there were a whole series of new small ³states² all pulling 
in different directions‹such was the picture. 
The October Revolution and the Brest Peace 
deepened and furthered the process of disintegration. 
People no longer spoke of Russia, but of Great Russia. 
The bourgeois governments formed in the border regions 
were imbued with hostility towards the socialist Soviet 
Government in the centre and declared war on it. 
Parallel with this, there was undoubtedly a very 
strong urge on the part of the workers¹ and peasants¹ 
Soviets in the border regions for unity with the centre. 
But this urge was swamped, and later suppressed, by the 
counter-trend of the foreign imperialists who had begun 
to interfere in our internal affairs. 
The Austro-German imperialists took the lead in 
this and skilfully exploited the disintegration of the 
old Russia, plentifully supplying the border governments 
with all they needed for their fight against the 
centre, occupying the border regions in certain parts, 
and generally contributing to the complete disintegration

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
234 
of Russia. The Entente imperialists had no wish to lag 
behind the Austro-Germans and adopted a similar 
course. 
The enemies of the Bolshevik Party of course (of 
course!) laid the blame for the disintegration on the 
Soviet Government. But it will be easily understood that 
the Soviet Government could not, and had no wish to, 
counteract the inevitable process of temporary disintegration. 
The Soviet Government realized that the unity of 
Russia, forcibly maintained with imperialist bayonets, 
was bound to break down with the downfall of Russian 
imperialism. The Soviet Government could not maintain 
unity with the methods used by Russian imperialism 
without being false to its own nature. The Soviet Government 
was aware that not any sort of unity was needed 
for socialism, but only fraternal unity, and that such 
unity could come only in the shape of a voluntary union 
of the labouring classes of the nationalities of Russia, 
or not at all. . . . 
The rout of Austro-German imperialism changed 
the whole picture. On the one hand, there developed in 
the border regions which had experienced the horrors 
of occupation a powerful gravitation towards the Russian 
proletariat and its forms of state structure which 
overwhelmed the separatist efforts of the border governments. 
On the other, there was no longer that foreign 
armed force (Austro-German imperialism) which had 
prevented the labouring masses of the occupied regions 
from manifesting their own political complexion. The 
mighty revolutionary upsurge which followed in the occupied 
regions, and the formation of a number of worker 
and peasant national republics, left no doubt regarding

THE GOVERNMENT¹S POLICY ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 235 
the political aspirations of the occupied regions. To the 
requests for recognition made by the Soviet national 
governments, the Soviet Government of Russia replied 
by unreservedly recognizing the full independence of the 
newly-formed Soviet republics. In acting thus the Soviet 
Government was adhering to its old and tried policy, 
which rejects all coercion against nationalities and 
demands full freedom of development for their labouring 
masses. The Soviet Government realized that only on 
a basis of mutual confidence could mutual understanding 
arise, and that only on a basis of mutual understanding 
could a firm and indestructible union of the 
peoples be built. 
Again the enemies of the Soviet Government did 
not fail to accuse it of making ³another attempt² to 
dismember Russia. The more reactionary of them, realizing 
how powerfully the border regions were gravitating 
to the centre, proclaimed a ³new² slogan: re-establishment 
of ³Greater Russia²‹by fire and sword, by the 
overthrow of the Soviet Government, of course. The 
Krasnovs and Denikins, the Kolchaks and Chaikovskys, 
who only yesterday had been trying to break Russia 
up into a number of separate counter-revolutionary 
hotbeds, now suddenly conceived the ³idea² of an ³all- 
Russian state.² The agents of British and French capital, 
whose political instinct cannot be denied, and who 
only yesterday were gambling on the disintegration of 
Russia, now changed their play so abruptly that they 
formed not one, but two ³all-Russian² governments 
simultaneously (in Siberia and in the South). All this 
speaks convincingly of the irrepressible gravitation of 
the border regions to the centre, which the home

J. V. S T A L I N 236 
and foreign counter-revolutionaries are now trying to 
exploit. 
It need scarcely be said that, after the year and a 
half of revolutionary work of the labouring masses of 
the nationalities of Russia, the counter-revolutionary 
appetites of the would-be restorers of the ³old Russia² 
(together with the old regime, of course) are doomed to 
disappointment. But the more utopian the plans of our 
counter-revolutionaries, the more realistic is seen to be the 
Soviet Government¹s policy, which is entirely based 
upon the mutual and fraternal confidence of the peoples 
of Russia. What is more, in the present state of international 
affairs, this policy is the only realistic and 
the only revolutionary one. 
This is eloquently attested, for example, by the recent 
declaration of the Congress of Soviets of the Byelorussian 
Republic55 establishing a federal connection with 
the Russian Soviet Republic. The fact is that the Byelorussian 
Soviet Republic, whose independence was recently 
recognized, has now, at its Congress of Soviets, voluntarily 
proclaimed its union with the Russian Republic. 
In i t s declaration of February 3, the Byelorussian 
Congress of Soviets affirms that ³only a free and voluntary 
union of the working people of all the now independent 
Soviet Republics can ensure the triumph of the 
workers and peasants in their struggle against the capitalist 
world.² 
³A voluntary union of the working people of all 
the independent Soviet Republics.² . . . This is precisely 
the course the Soviet Government has consistently 
advocated for uniting the peoples, and which is now 
yielding its beneficent fruits.

THE GOVERNMENT¹S POLICY ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 237 
The Byelorussian Congress of Soviets decided, furthermore, 
to unite with the Lithuanian Republic, and 
recognized the necessity for a federal tie between the two 
republics and the Russian Soviet Republic. Telegraphic 
dispatches state that the Soviet Government of Lithuania 
holds the same view, and, it appears, a conference 
of the Lithuanian Communist Party, the most influential 
of all the Lithuanian parties, approves the attitude 
of the Soviet Government of Lithuania. There is every 
reason to hope that the Congress of Soviets of Lithuania56 
now being convened will follow the same course. 
This is one more confirmation of the correctness of 
the Soviet Government¹s policy on the national question. 
Thus, from the breakdown of the old imperialist 
unity, through independent Soviet republics, the peoples 
of Russia are coming to a new, voluntary and fraternal 
unity. 
This path is unquestionably not of the easiest, but 
it is the only one that leads to a firm and indestructible 
socialist union of the labouring masses of the nationalities 
of Russia.

TO THE SOVIETS AND THE PARTY 
ORGANISATIONS OF TURKESTAN 
With the liberation of the Eastern border regions, 
it becomes the task of Party and Soviet officials to 
draw the labouring masses of the nationalities of these 
regions into the common work of building a socialist 
state. It is necessary to raise the cultural level of the 
labouring masses and to educate them in a socialist way, 
to promote a literature in the local languages, to appoint 
local people who are most closely connected with the 
proletariat to the Soviet organizations and draw them 
into the work of administering the territory. 
Only in that way can Soviet power become near 
and dear to the working people of Turkestan. 
It should be borne in mind that Turkestan, because 
of its geographical position, is a bridge connecting socialist 
Russia with the oppressed countries of the East, 
and that in view of this the consolidation of Soviet 
power in Turkestan may exert a supreme revolutionizing 
influence on the entire East. The above-mentioned 
task is therefore of exceptional importance to Turkestan. 
The People¹s Commissariat for the Affairs of Nationalities 
draws attention to a series of decisions of the 
Central Committee of the Party, the All-Russian Central

TWO CAMPS 
The world has definitely and irrevocably split into 
two camps: the camp of imperialism and the camp of 
socialism. 
Over there, in their camp, are America and Britain, 
France and Japan, with their capital, armaments, tried 
agents and experienced administrators. 
Here, in our camp, are Soviet Russia and the young 
Soviet republics and the growing proletarian revolution 
in the countries of Europe, without capital, without tried 
agents or experienced administrators, but, on the other 
hand, with experienced agitators capable of firing the 
hearts of the working people with the spirit of emancipation. 
The struggle between these two camps constitutes 
the hub of present-day affairs, determines the whole 
substance of the present home and foreign policies of the 
leaders of the old and the new worlds. 
Estland and Lithuania, the Ukraine and the Crimea, 
Turkestan and Siberia, Poland and the Caucasus, and, 
finally, Russia itself are not aims in themselves. They are 
only an arena of struggle, of a mortal struggle between 
two forces: imperialism, which is striving to strengthen the

TWO CAMPS 241 
yoke of slavery, and socialism, which is fighting for 
emancipation from slavery. 
The strength of imperialism lies in the ignorance of 
the masses, who create wealth for their masters and forge 
chains of oppression for themselves. But the ignorance 
of the masses is a transient thing and inevitably tends 
to be dispelled in the course of time, as the dissatisfaction 
of the masses grows and the revolutionary movement 
spreads. The imperialists have capital‹but who 
does not know that capital is powerless in the face of the 
inevitable? For this reason, the rule of imperialism is 
impermanent and insecure. 
The weakness of imperialism lies in its powerlessness 
to end the war without catastrophe, without increasing 
mass unemployment, without further robbery of its 
own workers and peasants, without further seizures of 
foreign territory. It is a question not of ending the 
war, nor even of victory over Germany, but of who is to 
be made to pay the billions spent on the war. Russia 
emerged from the imperialist war rejuvenated, because 
she ended the war at the cost of the imperialists, home 
and foreign, and laid the expense of the war on those 
who were directly responsible for it by expropriating 
them. The imperialists cannot do this; they cannot 
expropriate themselves, otherwise they would not be 
imperialists. To end the war in imperialist fashion, 
they are ³compelled² to doom the workers to starvation 
(wholesale unemployment due to the closing down of 
³unprofitable² plants, additional indirect taxation, a 
terrific rise in prices of food); they are ³compelled² to 
plunder Germany, Austria-Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, 
the Ukraine, the Caucasus, Turkestan, Siberia.

J. V. S T A L I N 242 
Need it be said that all this broadens the base of 
revolution, shakes the foundations of imperialism and 
hastens the inevitable catastrophe? 
Three months ago imperialism, drunk with victory, 
was rattling the sabre and threatening to overrun Russia 
with its armed hordes. How could ³poverty-stricken² 
and ³savage² Soviet Russia hold out against the ³disciplined² 
army of the British and French, who had smashed 
³even² the Germans, for all their vaunted technical 
equipment? So they thought. But they overlooked a 
³trifle,² they failed to realize that peace, even an ³indecent² 
peace, would inevitably undermine the ³discipline² 
of their army and rouse its opposition to another war, 
while unemployment and high living costs would inevitably 
strengthen the revolutionary movement of the 
workers against their imperialists. 
And what did we find? The ³disciplined² army proved 
unfit for purposes of intervention: it sickened with 
an inevitable disease‹demoralization. The boasted ³civil 
peace² and ³law and order² turned into their opposite, 
into civil war. The hastily concocted bourgeois 
³governments² in the border regions of Russia proved 
to be soap bubbles, unsuitable as a camouflage for intervention, 
which had been undertaken, of course (of course!), 
in the name of ³humanitarianism² and ³civilization.² 
As to Soviet Russia, not only did their hope for a ³walk 
over² fail; they even deemed it necessary to retreat a 
little and invite her to a ³conference,² on the Princes¹ 
Islands.57 For the successes of the Red Army, the appearance 
of new national Soviet republics which were infecting 
neighbouring countries with the spirit of revolution, 
the spread of revolution in the West and the appearance

TWO CAMPS 243 
of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Soviets in the Entente countries 
were arguments that were more than persuasive. 
What i s more, things have reached a point where 
even Clemenceau the ³implacable,² who only yesterday 
refused to issue passports to the Berne Conference58 and 
who was preparing to devour ³anarchistic² Russia, is 
today, having been rather mauled by the revolution, 
not averse to availing himself of the services of that 
honest ³Marxist² broker, the old Kautsky, and wants 
to send him to Russia to negotiate‹that is to say, ³investigate.² 
Truly: 
³Where are they now, the haughty words, 
The lordly strength, the royal mien?²59 
All these changes took place in the space of some 
three months. 
We have every ground for affirming that the trend 
will continue in the same direction, for it has to be 
admitted that in the present moment of ³storm and 
stress² Russia is the only country in which social and 
economic life is proceeding ³normally,² without strikes 
or anti-government demonstrations, that the Soviet 
Government is the most stable of all the existing governments 
in Europe, and that the strength and prestige 
of Soviet Russia, both at home and abroad, are growing 
day by day in direct proportion to the decline of 
the strength and prestige of the imperialist governments. 
The world has split into two irreconcilable camps:

straw, the ³League of Nations,² trying to save itself 
by uniting the robbers of all countries into a single 
alliance. But its efforts are in vain, because time and 
circumstances are working against it and in favour of 
socialism. The tide of socialist revolution is irresistibly 
rising and investing the strongholds of imperialism. Its 
thunder is re-echoing through the countries of the oppressed 
East. The soil is beginning to burn under the 
feet of imperialism. Imperialism is doomed to inevitable 
destruction.

OUR TASKS IN THE EAST 
With the advance of the Red Army eastward and the 
opening of the road to Turkestan, a number of new tasks 
confront us. 
The population of the eastern part of Russia is characterized 
neither by the homogeneity of the central 
gubernias, which facilitates socialist construction, nor 
by the cultural maturity of the western and southern 
border regions, which made it possible swiftly and painlessly 
to clothe the Soviet power in appropriate national 
forms. In contrast to these border regions and the centre 
of Russia, the eastern regions‹the Tatars, Bashkirs, 
Kirghiz, Uzbeks, Turkmen, Tajiks and a whole number 
of other ethnic groups (a total of about thirty million 
inhabitants)‹present a great diversity of culturally 
backward peoples who either have not yet emerged from 
medievalism, or have only recently entered the phase of 
capitalist development. 
This circumstance undoubtedly complicates and 
somewhat handicaps the tasks of Soviet power in the 
East. 
In addition to the complications of a purely internal 
character connected with the manner of life, there are 
complications of a ³historical² character, introduced,

J. V. S T A L I N 246 
so to speak, from without. We are referring to the tsarist 
government¹s imperialist policy aimed at crushing the 
peoples of the East, the insatiable greed of the Russian 
merchants who acted as masters in the eastern regions, 
and, also, the jesuitical policy of the Russian priests, 
who strove by fair means or foul to drag the Moslem 
peoples into the bosom of the Orthodox Church‹circumstances 
which aroused in the eastern peoples a feeling 
of distrust and hatred of everything Russian. 
It is true that the triumph of the proletarian revolution 
in Russia and the Soviet Government¹s policy 
of emancipating the oppressed peoples have undoubtedly 
helped to eliminate the atmosphere of national 
enmity and have won for the Russian proletariat the 
confidence and respect of the peoples of the East. More, 
there is every ground for asserting that the peoples of 
the East, their more enlightened representatives, are 
beginning to regard Russia as the bulwark and banner 
of their liberation from the chains of imperialism. Nevertheless, 
restricted culture and backward manner of 
life cannot be done away with at one stroke and they 
still make (and will continue to make) their influence 
felt in the building of Soviet power in the East. 
It is these handicaps that the Programme Drafting 
Commission of the Russian Communist Party60 has in 
mind when it says in its draft that as regards the question 
of national freedom ³the R.C.P. upholds the historical 
and class standpoint, giving consideration to the stage 
of historical development in which the given nation 
finds itself‹whether it is on the way from medievalism 
to bourgeois democracy, or from bourgeois democracy 
to Soviet democracy,² and that ³the proletariat of those

OUR TASKS IN THE EAST 247 
nations which were oppressor nations must exercise 
particular caution and be particularly heedful of the 
survivals of national sentiment among the labouring 
masses of the oppressed or unequal nations.² 
Our task is: 
1) In every way to raise the cultural level of the 
backward peoples, to build a broad system of schools 
and educational institutions, and to conduct our Soviet 
agitation, oral and printed, in the language which is 
native to and understood by the surrounding labouring 
population. 
2) To enlist the labouring masses of the East in the 
building of the Soviet state and to render them the 
utmost assistance in forming their volost, uyezd and 
other Soviets comprised of people who support the Soviet 
power and are closely connected with the local population. 
3) To do away with all disabilities, formal and 
actual, whether inherited from the old regime or arisen 
in the atmosphere of civil war, which prevent the 
peoples of the East from displaying the maximum independent 
activity in emancipating themselves from the 
survivals of medievalism and of the national oppression 
which has already been shattered. 
Only in this way can Soviet power become near 
and dear to the enslaved peoples of the boundless East. 
Only in this way can a bridge be erected between 
the proletarian revolution of the West and the antiimperialist 
movement of the East, thus forming an allembracing 
ring around dying imperialism. 
The task is to build a citadel of Soviet power in the 
East, to plant a socialist beacon in Kazan and Ufa,

J. V. S T A L I N 248 
in Samarkand and Tashkent, which will light the path 
to emancipation for the tormented peoples of the East. 
We have no doubt that our devoted Party and Soviet 
officials, who bore the whole brunt of the proletarian 
revolution and of the war with imperialism, will discharge 
with credit this further duty which is laid upon them 
by history.

February-March 1917 
The bourgeois revolution in Russia. The Milyukov- 
Kerensky Government. The Mensheviks and Socialist- 
Revolutionaries are the dominant parties in the Soviets. 
Out of the 400-500 members of the Petrograd Soviet, 
barely 40-50 are Bolsheviks. At the First Conference 
of Soviets of Russia,61 the Bolsheviks with difficulty 
muster 15-20 per cent of the votes. At this time the 
Bolshevik Party is the weakest of the socialist parties 
in Russia. Its organ, Pravda,62 is everywhere abused as 
³anarchistic.² Its speakers, when they call for a fight 
against the imperialist war, are dragged from the platform 
by soldiers and workers. Comrade Lenin¹s famous 
theses on Soviet power63 are not accepted by the Soviets. 
For the defencist parties of the social-patriotic brand‹ 
the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries‹it is a 
period of complete triumph. 
Meanwhile, the imperialist war does not stop and 
continues to do its deadly work, disrupting industry, 
undermining agriculture, dislocating the food supply 
and the transport system, and devouring fresh tens and 
hundreds of thousands of lives.

February-March 1918 
The proletarian revolution in Russia. The Kerensky- 
Konovalov bourgeois government is overthrown. Power 
is in the hands of the Soviets in the centre and in 
the provinces. The imperialist war is liquidated. The 
land becomes the property of the people. Workers¹ 
control is established. A Red Guard is formed. The 
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries fail in their 
attempt to turn over ³all power² to the Constituent 
Assembly in Petrograd. The Constituent Assembly is 
dismissed and the attempt at bourgeois restoration fails. 
Successes of the Red Guards in the South, the Urals, 
Siberia. The utterly routed Mensheviks and Socialist- 
Revolutionaries retire to the border regions, where they 
unite with the counter-revolutionaries, conclude an alliance 
with imperialism and declare war on Soviet Russia. 
The Bolsheviks are now the strongest and most 
united of all the parties in Russia. Already at the 
Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets in October 1917 
the Bolshevik Party commanded an absolute majority 
of the votes (65-70 per cent). The subsequent development 
of the Soviets is unswervingly in favour of the 
Bolsheviks. This applies not only to the Workers¹ Soviets, 
where 90 per cent of the members are Bolsheviks, 
and not only to the Soldiers¹ Soviets, where 60-70 per 
cent of the members are Bolsheviks, but also to the 
Peasants¹ Soviets, where, too, the Bolsheviks have won a 
majority. 
But the Bolshevik Party is now not only the strongest, 
it is the only socialist party in Russia. For the Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who hobnobbed

TWO YEARS 251 
with the Czechoslovaks and Dutov, with Krasnov and 
Alexeyev, with the Austro-German and the Anglo- 
French imperialists, have lost every vestige of moral 
prestige among the proletarian strata of Russia. 
However, this exceptionally favourable situation 
within the country is offset and counteracted by the 
fact that Russia still has no foreign allies, that socialist 
Russia represents an island surrounded by a sea of belligerent 
imperialism. The workers of Europe are exhausted, 
bleeding . . . but they are occupied with the war and 
have no time to ponder over the socialist order in 
Russia, the road of salvation from war, and so on. As 
to the European ³socialist² parties, how can they, who 
have sold their sword to the imperialists, do otherwise 
than revile the Bolsheviks‹those ³restless² people who 
are ³subverting² the workers with their ³costly,² ³dangerous 
experiments²? 
It is not surprising, therefore, that there is in this 
period a particularly strong tendency in the Bolshevik 
Party to widen the base of the proletarian revolution, 
to draw the workers of the West (and also of the 
East) into the revolutionary movement against imperialism, 
to establish permanent ties with the revolutionary 
workers of all countries.

parties in Moscow64 and foundation of a common militant 
organ of the militant workers of all countries‹

the proletarian revolution in Russia comes to an end: 
Russia now has allies. The imperialist ³League of Nations² 
in Paris and its auxiliary, the social-patriotic 
conference in Berne, try to bar the European workers 
from the ³Bolshevik contagion,² but fail in their 
object: Soviet Russia has become, as it was bound to 
become, the standard-bearer of the world proletarian 
revolution, the centre of attraction for the advanced 
revolutionary forces of the West and the East. From 
a ³purely Russian product,² Bolshevism becomes a formidable 
international force which is shaking the very 
foundations of world imperialism.

TWO YEARS 253 
That is now admitted even by the Mensheviks, who, 
having ³laid aside their concern² for the Constituent 
Assembly, and having lost their ³army,² little by 
little pass over into the camp of the Republic of Soviets. 
Nor is it now denied even by the Right-wing Socialist-
Revolutionaries, who, having lost the Constituent 
Assembly to the Kolchaks and Dutovs, are compelled 
to seek safety in the Land of Soviets.

Summing up 
These two years of proletarian struggle have fully 
confirmed what the Bolsheviks foresaw: the bankruptcy 
of imperialism and the inevitability of a world 
proletarian revolution; the rottenness of the Right-wing 
³socialist² parties and the decay of the Second International; 
the international significance of the Soviet 
system and the counter-revolutionary character of the 
Constituent Assembly slogan; the world significance of 
Bolshevism and the inevitable creation of a militant 
Third International.

IMPERIALISM¹S RESERVES 
The war between imperialism and socialism continues. 
National ³liberalism² and ³patronage² of ³small² 
nations; the ³peaceableness² of the Entente and its 
³renunciation² of intervention; the call for ³disarmament² 
and the ³readiness² for negotiation; the ³concern² 
for the ³Russian people² and ³desire² to ³assist² 
it with all ³available means²‹these and much else of 
a like nature are only a screen for the intensified supply 
of tanks and munitions to the enemies of socialism, 
an ordinary diplomatic manoeuvre designed to veil the 
³search² for new forms, ³acceptable² to ³public opinion,² 
of strangling socialism, of strangling the ³small² 
nations, colonies and semi-colonies. 
Some four months ago Allied imperialism, having 
vanquished its Austro-German rivals, was emphatically 
and categorically insisting on armed interference 
(intervention!) in ³Russian affairs.² No negotiations 
with ³anarchistic² Russia! The plan of the imperialists 
was to transfer part of their ³released² forces to the 
territory of Russia, incorporate them in the whiteguard 
units of the Skoropadskys and Krasnovs, the Denikins 
and Bicherakhovs, the Kolchaks and Chaikovskys, and 
constrict the seat of revolution, Soviet Russia, in an 
³iron ring.² But that plan was wrecked by the tide 
of revolution. The workers of Europe, swept by the

IMPERIALISM¹S RESERVES 255 
revolutionary movement, launched a fierce campaign 
against armed intervention. The ³released forces² proved 
to be manifestly unsuited for an armed fight against 
revolution. More, on coming in contact with the insurrectionary 
workers, they themselves became ³infected² 
with Bolshevism. Very eloquent proof of this was the 
capture by the Soviet forces of Kherson and Nikolayev, 
where the Entente troops refused to wage war on the 
workers. As to the projected ³iron ring,² it not only did 
not prove ³deadly² but, what is more, itself developed a 
number of fissures. The plan of outright and undisguised 
intervention thus turned out to be clearly ³inexpedient.² 
It is this that explains the recent statements of 
Lloyd George and Wilson on the ³permissibility² of 
negotiating with the Bolsheviks and on ³non-interference² 
in Russia¹s internal affairs, the proposal to send 
the Berne commission to Russia,65 and, lastly, the 
projected invitation (the second!) of all the ³de facto² 
governments in Russia to a ³peace² conference.66 
But i t was not only this factor that dictated the 
renunciation of undisguised intervention. It is also to 
be attributed to the fact that in the course of the 
struggle a new scheme, a new, disguised form of armed 
intervention was conceived, one more complicated, it 
is true, than open intervention, but on the other hand 
more ³convenient² for the ³civilized² and ³humane² 
Entente. We are referring to the alliance of the bourgeois 
governments of Rumania, Galicia, Poland, Germany 
and Finland hastily concocted by imperialism against 
Soviet Russia. I t is true that only yesterday these 
governments were at each other¹s throats on the plea 
of ³national² interests and national ³liberty.² I t is

J. V. S T A L I N 256 
true that only yesterday cries went up from all the 
housetops about a ³patriotic war² of Rumania against 
Galicia, of Galicia against Poland, of Poland against 
Germany. But what did the ³fatherland² count for in 
comparison to the financial wealth of the Entente, once the 
latter had ordered the cessation of ³internecine warfare²! 
Once the Entente had ordered the establishment of a 
united front against Soviet Russia, could they, the hirelings 
of imperialism, do anything but ³spring to attention²! 
Even the German Government, reviled and trampled 
in the mud as it was by the Entente, even it lost all 
sense of self-respect and begged to be allowed to take 
part in the crusade against socialism in the interests . . . 
of the Entente! Clearly, the Entente has every reason 
to rub its hands in glee as it prates about ³non-interference² 
in Russia¹s affairs and ³peace² negotiations 
with the Bolsheviks. What is the sense of undisguised 
intervention, which is ³dangerous² to imperialism and 
moreover demands costly sacrifices, when there is a 
possibility of organizing at the expense of others, of 
³small² nations, ³absolutely safe² intervention disguised 
under a national flag? A war of Rumania, Galicia, Poland 
and Germany against Russia? But, surely, this 
is a war for ³national existence,² for the ³protection 
of the eastern frontier,² a war against Bolshevik ³imperialism,² 
a war waged by the Rumanians, Galicians, 
Poles and Germans ³themselves.² What has the Entente 
got to do with it? True, the Entente is supplying them 
with money and arms, but that is simply a financial 
operation hallowed by the international law of the 
³civilized² world. Is it not clear that the Entente is as 
innocent as a dove, that it is ³against² intervention?. . .

IMPERIALISM¹S RESERVES 257 
Thus, imperialism has been compelled to pass from 
a policy of sabre-rattling, a policy of open intervention, 
to a policy of masked intervention, a policy of drawing 
dependent nations, small and big, into the fight against 
socialism. 
The policy of open intervention failed because of 
the growth of the revolutionary movement in Europe, 
because of the sympathy entertained by the workers of 
all countries for Soviet Russia. That policy was utilized 
to the full by revolutionary socialism to expose imperialism. 
There can be no doubt that in the end the policy of 
calling on the last reserves, the so-called ³small² nations, 
the policy of drawing the latter into the war against 
socialism, will similarly fail. And not only because the 
growing revolution in the West is, despite everything, 
sapping the foundations of imperialism, and not only 
because the revolutionary movement is steadily swelling 
within the ³small² nations themselves, but also because 
contact of the ³armed forces² of these nations with the 
revolutionary workers of Russia is bound to ³infect² 
them with the virus of Bolshevism. Socialism will avail 
itself of every opportunity to open the eyes of the workers 
and peasants of these nations to the predatory character 
of imperialism¹s ³paternal concern.² 
The inevitable result of the imperialist policy of 
masked intervention will be that it will draw the ³small² 
nations into the sphere of the revolution and extend the 
base of socialism.

EXCERPT FROM A SPEECH 
ON THE MILITARY QUESTION 
DELIVERED AT THE EIGHTH CONGRESS 
OF THE R.C.P.(B.)67 
March 21, 1919 
All the questions touched upon here boil down to 
one: is Russia to have, or not to have, a strictly disciplined 
regular army? 
Six months ago, after the collapse of the old, tsarist 
army, we had a new, a volunteer army, an army 
which was badly organized, which had a collective control, 
and which did not always obey orders. This was 
at a time when an Entente offensive was looming. The 
army was made up principally, if not exclusively, of 
workers. Because of the lack of discipline in this volunteer 
army, because it did not always obey orders, 
because of the disorganization in the control of the 
army, we sustained defeats and surrendered Kazan to 
the enemy, while Krasnov was successfully advancing 
from the South. . . . The facts show that a volunteer 
army cannot stand the test of criticism, that we shall 
not be able to defend our Republic unless we create 
another army, a regular army, one infused with the 
spirit of discipline, possessing a competent political department 
and able and ready to rise at the first command 
and march against the enemy.

EXCERPT FROM A SPEECH 259 
I must say that those non-working-class elements‹ 
the peasants‹who constitute the majority in our army 
will not voluntarily fight for socialism. A whole number 
of facts bear this out. The series of mutinies in the rear 
and at the fronts, the series of excesses at the fronts show 
that the non-proletarian elements comprising the majority 
of our army are not disposed to fight for communism 
voluntarily. Hence our task is to re-educate these 
elements, infusing them with a spirit of iron discipline, 
to get them to follow the lead of the proletariat at the 
front as well as in the rear, to compel them to fight for 
our common socialist cause, and, in the course of the 
war, to complete the building of a real regular army, 
which is alone capable of defending the country. 
That is how the question stands. 
. . . Either we create a real workers¹ and peasants¹ 
army, a strictly disciplined regular army, and defend 
the Republic, or we do not, and in that event our cause 
will be lost. 
. . . Smirnov¹s project is unacceptable, because it 
can only undermine discipline in the army and make 
it impossible to build a regular army.

THE RE-ORGANISATION OF STATE CONTROL 
Report Delivered at a Meeting of the All-Russian 
Central Executive Committee 
April 9, 1919 
(Newspaper Report) 
Comrade Stalin pointed out that the department 
of State Control was the only one which had not undergone 
the purging and reconstruction to which all the 
others had been subjected. To achieve real and genuine 
control, not control on paper, it was necessary, in the 
opinion of the speaker, to re-organize the existing State 
Control staff by replenishing it with new and fresh forces. 
The existing workers¹ control bodies should be united 
into a single whole, and all the forces engaged in control 
should be incorporated in the general State Control. 
Hence, the basic idea of the re-organization was to democratize 
State Control and to bring it into closer contact 
with the masses of workers and peasants. 
The draft decree68 submitted by the speaker was 
unanimously approved.

THE SHOOTING 
OF THE TWENTY-SIX BAKU COMRADES 
BY AGENTS OF BRITISH IMPERIALISM 
We present for the attention of our readers two documents69 
which testify to the savage murder of responsible 
officials of Soviet power in Baku by the British 
imperialists in the autumn of last year. These documents 
are taken from the Baku Socialist-Revolutionary 
newspaper Znamya Truda70 and the Baku newspaper Yedinaya 
Rossiya,71 that is to say from the very same circles 
which only yesterday called in the aid of the British 
and betrayed the Bolsheviks, and which are now 
forced by the course of events to denounce their allies 
of yesterday. 
The first document tells of the barbarous shooting 
without trial of 26 Soviet officials of the city of Baku 
(Shaumyan, Djaparidze, Fioletov, Malygin and others) 
by the British Captain Teague-Jones on the night of 
September 20, 1918, on the road from Krasnovodsk to 
Ashkhabad, to which he was convoying them as war 
prisoners. Teague-Jones and his Socialist-Revolutionary 
and Menshevik partners hoped at first to hush up the 
matter, intending to circulate false testimony to the effect 
that the Baku Bolsheviks had died a ³natural²

J. V. S T A L I N 262 
death in prison or hospital. But evidently this plan 
fell through, for it turns out that there exist eye-witnesses 
who refuse to keep silent and who are ready thoroughly 
to expose the British savages. This document is 
signed by Chaikin, a Socialist-Revolutionary. 
The second document recounts a conversation that 
the author of the first document, Chaikin, had with the 
British General Thomson towards the close of March 
1919. General Thomson demanded that Chaikin should 
name the eye-witnesses of the savage murder of the 
26 Baku Bolsheviks by Captain Teague-Jones. Chaikin 
was prepared to present the documents and to name the 
witnesses on condition that a commission of inquiry were 
set up composed of representatives of the British command, 
the population of Baku and the Turkestan Bolsheviks. 
Chaikin furthermore demanded a guarantee that the 
Turkestan witnesses would not be assassinated by British 
agents. Since Thomson refused to agree to the appointment 
of a commission of inquiry and would give 
no guarantee of the personal safety of the witnesses, 
the conversation was broken off and Chaikin left. The 
document is interesting because it indirectly confirms 
the barbarity of the British imperialists, and not merely 
testifies but cries out against the impunity and savagery 
of the British agents who vent their ferocity on Baku 
and Transcaspian ³natives² just as they do on Negroes in 
Central Africa. 
The story of the 26 Baku Bolsheviks is as follows. 
In August 1918, when the Turkish forces had come 
within a short distance of Baku and the Socialist-Revolutionary 
and Menshevik members of the Baku Soviet, 
against the opposition of the Bolsheviks, had secured

THE SHOOTING OF THE TWENTY-SIX BAKU COMRADES 263 
the support of the majority of the Soviet and had called in 
the aid of the British imperialists, the Baku Bolsheviks, 
headed by Shaumyan and Djaparidze, being in the 
minority, resigned their authority and left the field 
clear for their political opponents. The Bolsheviks decided, 
with the consent of the newly-formed British, 
Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik authority 
in Baku, to evacuate to Petrovsk, the nearest seat of 
Soviet power. But on the way to Petrovsk the steamer 
carrying the Baku Bolsheviks and their families 
was shelled by British ships which had followed in 
pursuit and was convoyed to Krasnovodsk. This was in 
August. 
The Russian Soviet Government applied on several 
occasions to the British command, demanding the release 
of the Baku comrades and their families in exchange 
for British prisoners, but the British command invariably 
refrained from replying. Already in October information 
began to come in from private persons and organizations 
to the effect that the Baku comrades had been 
shot. On March 5, 1919, Astrakhan received a radio 
message from Tiflis stating that ³Djaparidze and Shaumyan 
are not in the hands of the British command; 
according to local information, they were killed last 
September near Kizyl-Arvat by the arbitrary act of 
a group of workers.² This, apparently, was the first 
official attempt on the part of the British assassins to 
lay the blame for their atrocious act on the workers, who 
were boundlessly devoted to Shaumyan and Djaparidze. 
Now, after the publication of the above-mentioned 
documents, i t must be taken as proven that our 
Baku comrades, who had quitted the political arena

J. V. S T A L I N 264 
voluntarily and were on their way to Petrovsk as 
evacuees, actually were shot without t r i a l by the 
cannibals from ³civilized² and ³humane² Britain. 
In the ³civilized² countries it is customary to talk 
about Bolshevik terror and Bolshevik atrocities, and the 
Anglo-French imperialists are usually depicted as foes 
of terror and shooting. But is i t not clear that the 
Soviet Government has never dealt with its opponents 
so foully and basely as the ³civilized² and ³humane² 
British, and that only imperialist cannibals who are 
corrupt to the core and devoid of all moral integrity 
need to resort to murder by night, to criminal attacks 
on unarmed political leaders of the opposing camp? If 
there are any who still doubt this, let them read the 
documents we print below and call things by their proper 
names. 
When the Baku Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
invited the British to Baku and betrayed 
the Bolsheviks, they thought they would be able to 
³use² the British ³guests² as a force; they believed that 
they would remain the masters of the country and the 
³guests² would eventually go back home. Actually, 
the reverse happened: it was the ³guests² that became 
the absolute masters, while the Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and Mensheviks became direct accessories to the 
foul and villainous murder of the 26 Bolshevik commissars. 
And the Socialist-Revolutionaries were compelled 
to go into opposition, cautiously exposing their 
new masters, while the Mensheviks are compelled to 
advocate in their Baku newspaper Iskra72 a bloc with 
the Bolsheviks against the ³welcome guests² of yesterday.

THE SHOOTING OF THE TWENTY-SIX BAKU COMRADES 265 
Is it not clear that the alliance of the Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and Mensheviks with the agents of imperialism 
is an ³alliance² of slaves and menials with their 
masters? If there are still any who doubt this, let them 
read the ³conversation² between General Thomson and 
Mr. Chaikin reproduced below and honestly say whether 
Mr. Chaikin resembles a master, and General Thomson 
a ³welcome guest.²

TELEGRAM 
TO THE INSPECTOR-EXTRAORDINARY 
OF STATE CONTROL, SHCHIGRY 
In the course of the inquiry into the causes of the 
agrarian disorders, besides inquiring into the general 
political sentiment of the peasant masses of the uyezd, 
please pay attention to the following: 
1) The policy of the Land Department and the State 
Farms Board in the organizing of state farms. Have 
there been cases of irregular appropriation of peasant 
holdings for the organization of state farms? Has their 
organization been accompanied by other coercive actions 
materially affecting the condition of the peasant farms? 
2) The policy of the Land Department in the organizing 
of collective farming. Have there been elements of 
coercion in the organizing of agricultural communes and 
artels, common ploughing, etc.? Has the organizing of 
collective farming been accompanied by infringements of 
the vital interests of the local peasantry? 
3) The policy of the Chief Sugar Board in nationalizing 
land for sugar-beet plantations. Is nationalization 
being carried out in a way which is against the fundamental 
interests of the peasants? Are the nationalized 
tracts of land making it difficult for the peasants to use 
their holdings? Have there been other actions liable to 
incense the peasants (e.g., assignment of land to sugar

refineries obviously in excess of their actual requirements; 
nationalization of tracts of land not formerly used 
for sugar-beet cultivation, etc.)? 
4) Also the following questions: Is not the agrarian 
unrest due to land shortage in the district? Has the land 
of non-labouring elements been placed at the disposal 
of the peasants, and on what conditions? Are there any 
actions in general on the part of the Uyezd Land Department 
or any of its officials, or on the part of volost 
land departments, likely to incense the peasants because 
they do not conform with the instructions of the centre 
or the requirements of expediency? Also, have there 
been instances of passivity or abuse of office on the part 
of the authorities?

NOTE TO V. I. LENIN FROM PETROGRAD 
BY DIRECT WIRE73 
The dispatch of units is undoubtedly better organized 
now than it was some three months ago, but it is also 
clear to me that neither the Commander-in-Chief nor his 
chief of staff know anything about the units which are being 
sent to Petrograd. Hence such surprises as the arrival 
of mere handfuls of men under the guise of regiments 
of the 2nd Brigade or the Cavalry Brigade 
from Kazan. At any rate, Petrograd has received so far 
only six hundred men from military schools who are really 
fit for action. 
But the chief thing, of course, is not the quantity, 
but the quality of the units. All we need to drive the 
whole pack beyond Narva is three infantry regiments‹ 
fit for action, of course‹and at least one cavalry regiment. 
If you could have seen your way to meet this 
small request in time, the Estonians would have been 
driven back before now. 
However, there is no cause for alarm, since the situation 
at the front has become stable, the front line has 
stiffened, and in places our forces are already advancing. 
Today I inspected our Karelian fortifications and 
on the whole found the situation tolerable. The Finns

NOTE TO V. I. LENIN BY DIRECT WIRE 269 
are maintaining a stubborn silence and, strangely enough, 
have not taken advantage of the opportunity. But this 
is to be attributed to the fact that their own position 
at home is growing more and more unstable, as we are 
assured by Finnish comrades familiar with the state of 
affairs. 
I was shown today a proposal of the Commanderin-
Chief to cut down the navy on account of the fuel 
crisis. I conferred on this subject with all our naval men 
and have arrived at the conviction that the Commanderin-
Chief ¹s proposal is absolutely incorrect. Reasons: 
first, if big units are to be converted into floating rafts 
it will be impossible to operate their guns, that is, 
the latter will simply not shoot, because there is a direct 
connection between the movement of a ship and 
the action of its guns; secondly, it is not true that we 
have no large-calibre shells‹the other day twelve bargeloads 
of shells were ³discovered²; thirdly, the fuel 
crisis is passing, because we have already succeeded in 
accumulating four hundred and twenty thousand poods 
of coal, apart from mazut, and are receiving a trainload 
of coal daily; fourthly, I have convinced myself that 
our navy is being turned into a real navy, with welldisciplined 
sailors who are prepared to defend Petrograd 
might and main. 
I do not want to mention here the number of battle 
units already fit for action, but I consider it my duty to 
say that with the naval forces available we could defend 
Petrograd with credit against any attack from the sea. 
In view of this, I, and all the Petrograd comrades, 
insist that the Commander-in-Chief ¹s proposal be rejected.

J. V. S T A L I N 270 
Further, I consider it absolutely essential that coal 
deliveries be increased to two trainloads a day for a 
period of three or four weeks. This, our naval men assure 
us, will enable us to put our submarine and surface 
fleet definitely in fighting trim.

Following the capture of Krasnaya Gorka, Seraya 
Loshad74 has been taken. Their guns are in perfect 
order. A rapid check of all the forts and fortresses is 
under way. 
Naval experts assert that the capture of Krasnaya 
Gorka from the sea runs counter to naval science. 
I can only deplore such so-called science. The swift 
capture of Gorka was due to the grossest interference in 
the operations by me and civilians generally, even to 
the point of countermanding orders on land and sea and 
imposing our own. 
I consider it my duty to declare that I shall continue 
to act in this way in future, despite all my reverence

NOTE TO V. I. LENIN FROM PETROGRAD 
BY DIRECT WIRE 
I consider it necessary to draw your attention to the 
following questions. 
First. Kolchak is the most serious enemy, because 
he has sufficient space for retreat, sufficient man power 
for his army, and a rear abounding in food. Compared 
with Kolchak, General Rodzyanko is a mere gnat, because 
he has neither food in his rear, nor space for retreat, 
nor sufficient man power. The mobilization of twenty 
age classes, to which he is now compelled to resort in 
his two or three uyezds owing to lack of man power, 
will mean the end of him, since the peasants cannot 
stand mobilization on such a scale and are bound to turn 
away from him. Consequently, under no circumstances 
should forces be withdrawn from the Eastern Front for 
the Petrograd Front in such numbers as might compel 
us to halt our offensive on the Eastern Front. In order 
to force Rodzyanko back to the Estland frontier (there 
is no point in our going any further) one division will 
be sufficient, and its removal will not involve halting 
the offensive on the Eastern Front. Please give this your 
special attention.

NOTE TO V. I. LENIN BY DIRECT WIRE 273 
Second. We have unearthed a big conspiracy in the 
Kronstadt area. The battery commanders of all the forts 
in the entire Kronstadt fortified area are implicated. The 
aim of the conspiracy was to seize possession of the 
fortress, take control of the fleet, open fire on the rear of 
our troops, and clear the road to Petrograd for Rodzyanko. 
The relevant documents have fallen into our hands. 
It is now clear to me why Rodzyanko, with his relatively 
small forces, advanced so brazenly on Petrograd. 
The insolence of the Finns is now also understandable. 
Understandable, too, are the wholesale desertions 
of our combat officers. So is the strange fact that 
at the moment of the betrayal of Krasnaya Gorka the 
British warships vanished from the scene; the British, 
obviously, considered that direct interference on their 
part (intervention!) would not be ³convenient,² and 
preferred to turn up after the fortress and the fleet had 
fallen into the hands of the Whites, with the object of 
³helping the Russian people² to establish a new, ³democratic 
system.² 
Obviously, Rodzyanko and Yudenich (to the latter 
can be traced all the threads of the conspiracy, which 
was financed by Britain through the Italian, Swiss and 
Danish embassies) based their whole scheme on the expectation 
of a successful issue of the conspiracy, which, 
I hope, we have nipped in the bud (all persons implicated 
have been arrested and the investigation is proceeding). 
My request: make no relaxations in regard to the arrested 
embassy officials, keep them in strict confinement 
until the completion of the investigation, which 
is revealing a host of new threads.

J. V. S T A L I N 274 
I shall give you a more detailed account within three 
or four days, by which time I hope to come to Moscow 
for a day, if you have no objection. 
I am sending the map. I could not do so until now 
simply because I was away all the time on front-line 
business, mostly at the front itself.

THE PETROGRAD FRONT 
Pravda Interview 
Comrade Stalin, who returned from the Petrograd Front a few 
days ago, gave our correspondent his impressions of the situation 
at the front. 
1. THE APPROACHES TO PETROGRAD 
The approaches to Petrograd are those points, proceeding 
from which the enemy, if he is successful, may 
surround Petrograd, cut it off from Russia and finally 
take it. These points are: a) the Petrozavodsk sector, 
with Zvanka as the line of advance; objective‹to envelop 
Petrograd from the East; b) the Olonets sector, with Lodeinoye 
Polye as the line of advance; objective‹to 
turn the flank of our Petrozavodsk forces; c) the Karelian 
sector, with Petrograd as the direct line of advance; objective‹
to seize Petrograd from the North; d) the Narva 
sector, with Gatchina and Krasnoye Selo as the line of 
advance; objective‹to capture Petrograd from the South- 
West, or, at least, to capture the Gatchina-Tosno line and 
envelop Petrograd from the South; e) the Pskov sector, 
with Dno-Bologoye as the line of advance; objective‹to 
cut Petrograd off from Moscow; and, lastly, f) the Gulf 
of Finland and Lake Ladoga, which offer the enemy the 
possibility of landing forces west and east of Petrograd.

J. V. S T A L I N 276 
2. THE ENEMY¹S FORCES 
The enemy¹s forces in these sectors are a motley lot 
and of various strengths. In the Petrozavodsk sector, Serbs, 
Poles, British, Canadians and a group of Russian whiteguard 
officers are operating, all of them maintained with 
funds supplied by the so-called Allies. The Olonets 
sector is held by White Finns, hired on two or three 
months¹ contract by the Finnish Government and commanded 
by German officers who remained behind after 
the German occupation. The Karelian sector is manned 
by so-called regular Finnish units. The Narva sector 
is manned by Russian units, recruited from Russian 
war prisoners, and by Ingermanland units recruited 
from the local inhabitants. These units are commanded 
by Major-General Rodzyanko. The forces in the Pskov 
sector also consist of Russian units made up of war 
prisoners and local inhabitants, and are commanded by 
Balakhovich. Operating in the Gulf of Finland are 
destroyers (5 to 12) and submarines (2 to 8)‹British 
and Finnish, according to available information. 
To judge by all the evidence, the enemy¹s forces on 
the Petrograd Front are not large. The Narva sector, 
where the enemy is most active, suffers no less from 
a shortage of ³man power² than the other, less active, 
though no less important, sectors. 
This, indeed, explains why, in spite of the fact that 
already two months ago The Times75 was jubilantly predicting 
the fall of Petrograd ³within two or three days,² 
the enemy, far from having attained his general 
objective‹the surrounding of Petrograd‹has not in 
this period scored even a single partial success on any

THE PETROGRAD FRONT 277 
one of the sectors, in the sense of capturing some decisive 
point. 
Apparently, the vaunted ³North-West Army² commanded 
by General Yudenich from his vantage ground 
in Finland, the army on which that old fox Guchkov 
reposed his hopes in his report to Denikin, has so 
far not even been hatched. 
3. THE ENEMY¹S CALCULATIONS 
Judging by all the evidence, the enemy reckoned not 
only, or, rather, not so much, on his own forces as on 
the forces of his supporters, the whiteguards in the rear of 
our forces, in Petrograd and at the fronts. These were, 
firstly, the so-called embassies of bourgeois states which 
continued to exist in Petrograd (French, Swiss, Greek, Italian, 
Dutch, Danish, Rumanian, etc.), which financed the 
whiteguards and engaged in espionage on behalf of Yudenich 
and the British, French, Finnish and Estonian bourgeoisie. 
These gentry scattered money right and left, 
buying everyone in the rear of our army who was open 
to be bought. Next, the venal elements among the Russian 
officers, who have forgotten Russia, have lost all sense 
of honour and are ready to desert to the enemies of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ Russia. Lastly, the have-beens, the 
bourgeois and landlords who had suffered at the hands of 
the Petrograd proletariat and who, as it later appeared, 
had accumulated weapons and were waiting for a suitable 
moment to stab our forces in the back. These were the 
forces upon which the enemy reckoned when he marched 
on Petrograd. To capture Krasnaya Gorka, the key to 
Kronstadt, and thus put the fortified area out of action,

J. V. S T A L I N 278 
raise revolt in the forts and shell Petrograd, and then, 
combining a general offensive at the front with a revolt 
within Petrograd at the moment of general confusion, 
surround and capture the centre of the proletarian revolution‹
such were the enemy¹s calculations. 
4. THE SITUATION AT THE FRONT 
However, the enemy miscalculated. Krasnaya Gorka, 
which the enemy managed to occupy for twenty-four 
hours thanks to internal treachery on the part of the Left 
Socialist-Revolutionaries, was swiftly restored to Soviet 
Russia by a powerful blow struck from sea and land by 
the Baltic sailors. The Kronstadt strongpoints, which at 
one moment had begun to waver owing to the treachery 
of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Menshevik 
defencists and the venal section of the officer class, 
were promptly brought to order by the iron hand of the 
Revolutionary Military Council of the Baltic Fleet. The 
so-called embassies and their spies were arrested and 
removed to less troublesome places. In some of the embassies, 
moreover, machine guns, rifles (in the Rumanian 
Embassy even one gun), secret telephone exchanges, 
etc., were discovered. A sweeping search carried 
out in the bourgeois quarters of Petrograd unearthed 
four thousand rifles and several hundred bombs. 
As to the enemy¹s general offensive, far from being 
crowned with success, as The Times had loudly proclaimed, 
it never even succeeded in getting started. The Finnish 
Whites at Olonets, who were trying to occupy Lodeinoye 
Polye, have been overwhelmed and driven back into 
Finland. The enemy¹s Petrozavodsk group, which was

THE PETROGRAD FRONT 279 
stationed only a few versts from Petrozavodsk, is now 
rapidly retreating under the onslaught of our units, which 
have turned its flank. The enemy¹s Pskov group has 
lost the initiative, is making no headway, and in places 
is even retreating. As to the enemy¹s Narva group, the 
most active, far from having attained its objective, it 
is continuously retiring under the onslaught of our units 
and is disintegrating and melting away on the roads to 
Yamburg under the blows of the Red Army. The Entente¹s 
jubilations thus appear to have been premature. 
The hopes of Guchkov and Yudenich have been 
disappointed. The Karelian sector is still passive and 
nothing yet can be said about it, because the Finnish 
Government, after its reverses at Vidlitsa Zavod,76 has 
noticeably moderated its tone and dropped its shrill abuse 
of the Russian Government, and, what is more, the 
so-called incidents on the Karelian Front have practically 
ceased. 
Whether this is the calm before the storm, only the 
Finnish Government knows. At all events, it may be said 
that Petrograd is prepared for all possible surprises. 
5. THE NAVY 
I cannot refrain from saying a few words about the 
navy. It is a subject for congratulation that the Baltic 
Fleet, which was believed to be non-existent, is being 
most effectively regenerated. This is admitted by our 
enemies as well as our friends. Equally gratifying is the 
fact that the scourge of venality with which a section 
of the Russian officer class is afflicted has least of all 
contaminated the commanding personnel of the navy.

J. V. S T A L I N 280 
Here we have men who, to their honour be it said, prize 
the dignity and independence of Russia higher than British 
gold. Even more gratifying is the fact that the Baltic 
sailors have become their old selves again, and by their 
valorous deeds have revived the finest traditions of the 
Russian revolutionary navy. Had it not been for these 
factors Petrograd would not have been safeguarded 
against the most dangerous surprises from the sea. A most 
typical illustration of the regeneration of our navy 
was the unequal engagement fought in June by two of 
our destroyers against four enemy destroyers and three 
submarines, from which, thanks to the gallantry of our 
sailors and the skilful direction of the commander of 
the detachment, our destroyers emerged victorious, having 
sunk one of the enemy's submarines. 
6. SUMMING UP 
Rodzyanko is often compared with Kolchak as a 
menace to Soviet Russia, being regarded as no less 
dangerous than Kolchak. The comparison is incorrect. 
Kolchak really is dangerous, because he has space to 
which to retire, he has the man power with which to 
replenish his units, and he has the food with which to 
feed his army. The misfortune of Rodzyanko and Yudenich 
is that they have not enough space, man power, 
or food. Finland and Estland, of course, do to some 
extent represent a base for the formation of whiteguard 
units from Russian war prisoners. But, firstly, war prisoners 
cannot provide either sufficient or fully reliable 
men for the whiteguard units. Secondly, because of the 
mounting revolutionary unrest in Finland and Estland,

THE PETROGRAD FRONT 281 
the conditions in these countries themselves are not 
favourable for the formation of whiteguard units. Thirdly, 
the territory seized by Rodzyanko and Balakhovich 
(in all about two uyezds) is being gradually and systematically 
narrowed, and the vaunted ³North-West 
Army,² if it is destined to be born at all, will soon 
have no room for deployment and manoeuvre. Because‹ 
and this must be acknowledged‹neither Finland nor 
Estland, for the present at least, are placing ³their own 
territory² at the disposal of Rodzyanko, Balakhovich 
and Yudenich. The ³North-West Army² is an army 
without a rear. It goes without saying that such an 
³army² cannot exist for long, unless of course some new 
and weighty international factor favourable to the enemy 
interferes with the chain of developments‹which, 
however, to judge by all the signs, he has no grounds 
to anticipate. 
The Red Army at Petrograd should win. 
Pravda, No. 147, 
July 8, 1919

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 
ABOUT THE SITUATION 
ON THE WESTERN FRONT77 
To Comrade Lenin. 
The situation on the Western Front is becoming 
more and more ominous. 
The old, battered and weary units of the Sixteenth 
Army, which is being hard pressed by the most 
active enemy on the Western Front‹the Poles‹are 
not only unable to withstand the onslaught, are not only 
unable to defend themselves, but have even become 
incapable of covering the retreat of their batteries, which 
are, naturally, falling into the hands of the enemy. I 
am afraid that, with its units in such a state, the Sixteenth 
Army in its retreat to the Berezina will find 
itself without guns or baggage trains. There is also the 
danger that the battered and absolutely demoralized 
cadres of the majority of the regiments may soon be 
incapable of assimilating replenishments, which moreover‹
it must be said‹are arriving with preposterous 
delay. 
The enemy is driving towards the Berezina along 
two main directions: towards Borisov, and towards Slutsk 
and Bobruisk. And he is driving successfully, for he has 
already advanced some thirty versts in the direction 
of Borisov, and in the South, with the capture of Slutsk,

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN ABOUT THE WESTERN FRONT 283 
he has seized possession of the key to Bobruisk‹the 
splendid highway, the only one in the area. 
I f Borisov i s captured, and i f , as i s likely, the 
severely battered 17th Division of the Sixteenth Army 
rolls back as a result, the Fifteenth Army will be in 
jeopardy, and Polotsk and Dvinsk will be directly menaced. 
And if Bobruisk is captured and the enemy strikes 
at Rechitsa (which is his direct aim), the entire 
Pripyat group of the Sixteenth Army, that is, the 8th 
Division, will automatically suffer disaster, Gomel will 
be directly threatened, and the flank of the Twelfth 
Army will be laid bare. 
In brief, if we allow the enemy to knock out our Sixteenth 
Army, and he is already doing it, we shall be letting 
down the Fifteenth and Twelfth Armies, and we shall 
then have to repair not only the Sixteenth Army but the 
whole front, and at a far heavier cost. 
Evidently, we are approximately in the same position 
as that of the Eastern Front last year, when Vatsetis 
and Kostyaev allowed Kolchak to knock out first 
our Third Army, then the Second and then the Fifth, 
thereby quite unnecessarily wrecking the work of the 
whole front for a good half year. 
On the Western Front, this prospect has every 
chance of becoming a reality. 
I have already written before that the Western Front 
represents a threadbare garment which cannot be 
patched up without trained reserves, and that the enemy 
has only to deliver one serious blow at one of the important 
points to make the whole front reel, or rather, shake. 
Unfortunately, these apprehensions of mine are now 
beginning to be borne out.

J. V. S T A L I N 284
Yet the enemy in the West, who is united under a 
single command, has not yet brought into action those 
Russian corps which he has ready, or nearly ready, in 
Riga, Warsaw and Kishinev. 
About three weeks ago I believed that one division 
would be enough to enable us to launch an offensive 
and occupy the Molodechno and Baranovichi junctions. 
Now one division may not be enough even to enable 
us to hold the Borisov-Bobruisk-Mozyr line. 
A successful offensive is not even to be thought of, 
because for this we should now (August 11) need at 
least two or three divisions. 
Now decide yourself: can you let us have one division, 
if only in successive brigades, or are you going 
to allow the enemy to smash the already crumbling 
Sixteenth Army? But decide without delay, because 
every hour is precious. 
Yours, 
J. Stalin

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 
FROM THE SOUTHERN FRONT78 
Comrade Lenin, 
About two months ago General Headquarters did not 
object in principle to the main blow being delivered 
from west to east, through the Donets Basin. And if 
it rejected it nevertheless, it was on the plea of the ³legacy² 
left by the retreat of the southern troops in the 
summer, that i s , the haphazard grouping of troops 
in the area of the present South-Eastern Front, the reforming 
of which (the grouping) would entail considerable 
loss of time, to Denikin¹s advantage. It was 
only for this reason that I did not object to the 
officially adopted direction of the blow. But now 
the situation has radically changed, and with it the 
grouping of forces: the Eighth Army (the major army 
on the former Southern Front) has moved into the 
area of the Southern Front and is directly facing the 
Donets Basin; Budyonny¹s Cavalry Corps (another major 
force) has likewise moved into the Southern Front area; 
and a new force has been added‹the Latvian Division, 
which within a month will have been replenished 
and will again represent a formidable force to 
Denikin.

J. V. S T A L I N 286
You see that the old grouping (the ³legacy²) no 
longer exists. What then induces General Headquarters 
to insist on the old plan? Nothing, apparently, but 
obstinacy‹if you like, factionalism, factionalism of 
the most obtuse kind and most dangerous to the 
Republic, which i s cultivated in General Headquarters 
by that ³strategic² bantam cock Gusev. The 
other day General Headquarters issued instructions 
to Shorin to advance from the Tsaritsyn area on 
Novorossiisk through the Don steppe by a line 
along which i t may be convenient for our aviators 
to fly, but along which our infantry and our artillery 
will find it quite impossible to plod. It does not need 
to be proved that this insane (projected) campaign 
through a hostile environment and where there are 
absolutely no roads threatens us with utter disaster. 
I t should not be difficult to understand that such 
a campaign against Cossack villages, as recent experience 
has shown, can only rally the Cossacks 
around Denikin and against us in defence of their villages, 
can only serve to set up Denikin as the saviour of the 
Don, can only create a Cossack army for Denikin, that 
is, can only strengthen Denikin. 
Precisely for this reason it is essential at once, without 
loss of time, to change the old plan, which has 
already been abolished in practice, and replace it by 
a plan under which the main blow will be directed from 
the Voronezh area, through Kharkov and the Donets 
Basin, on Rostov. Firstly, here we shall have an environment 
that is not hostile, but on the contrary, sympathetic 
to us, which will facilitate our advance. Secondly, 
we shall secure a most important railway net

LETTER TO V. I. LENIN FROM THE SOUTHERN FRONT 287 
work (Donets) and the major supply artery of Denikin¹s 
army‹the Voronezh-Rostov line (the loss of which 
will leave the Cossack army without supplies in the 
winter, because the Don River, by which the Don Army 
is supplied, will have frozen over, and the East Donets 
Railway, Likhaya-Tsaritsyn, will be cut). Thirdly, by this 
advance we shall be cutting Denikin¹s army in 
two, one part of which, the Volunteer Army, we shall 
leave to Makhno to devour, while the Cossack armies 
we shall threaten with the danger of being outflanked. 
Fourthly, we shall be in a position to set the Cossacks 
at loggerheads with Denikin, who, if our advance is 
successful, will endeavour to move the Cossack units 
westward, to which the majority of the Cossacks will 
not agree, if, of course, by that time we put before them 
the issue of peace, of negotiations for peace, and so on. 
Fifthly, we shall secure coal, and Denikin will be left 
without coal. 
This plan must be adopted without delay, since 
General Headquarters¹ plan of transfer and distribution 
of regiments threatens to nullify our recent 
successes on the Southern Front. I say nothing of the 
fact that General Headquarters is ignoring, and; has 
virtually rescinded, the recent decision of the Central 
Committee and the Government‹³Everything for the 
Southern Front.² 
In short, the old plan, which has already been abolished 
in reality, must under no circumstances be 
galvanized into life. That would be dangerous to the 
Republic; it would most certainly improve Denikin¹s 
position. It must be replaced by another plan. Conditions 
and circumstances are not only ripe for such

J. V. S T A L I N 288 
a change, they imperatively dictate it. In that event the 
distribution of regiments will also proceed on different 
lines. 
Without this, my work on the Southern Front will 
become meaningless, criminal and futile, which will 
give me the right, or rather will force me, to go anywhere, 
even to the devil himself, only not to remain on 
the Southern Front.

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist

Since the First Congress, a year has elapsed. This

of Western Europe and America and the birth of Communist 
Parties over there, in the West; the second is 
the awakening of the peoples of the East, the growth 
of the revolutionary movement in the East, among the 
oppressed peoples of the East. Over there, in the West, 
the proletarians are threatening to demolish the vanguard 
of the imperialist powers and to take power into 
their own hands. Here the proletarians are threatening 
to disrupt imperialism¹s rear, the East, the source of its 
wealth, because the East is the basis on which the 
wealth of imperialism is built; it is from there that it 
derives its strength, and it is to there that it proposes to 
retire if it is beaten in Western Europe.

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
291 
A year ago, in the West, world imperialism was 
threatening to surround Soviet Russia with a tight ring. 
It now turns out that it is itself surrounded, because 
it is being struck at both on the flanks and in the rear. 
When, a year ago, the delegates to the First Moslem 
Congress of the Peoples of the East were about to leave 
for their homes, they vowed to do everything in their 
power to rouse the peoples of the East from their slumber 
and to erect a bridge between the revolution in 
the West and the oppressed peoples in the East. Reviewing 
this work now, we may note with satisfaction 
that this revolutionary activity has not been in vain, 
that a bridge has been erected against those who strangle 
the liberty of all the oppressed peoples. 
Lastly, if our forces, our Red forces, have advanced 
eastward so swiftly, not the least factor contributing 
to this, of course, has been your work, comrade delegates. 
If the road to the East is now open, that too the 
revolution owes to the supreme efforts of our comrades, 
the delegates here, in the work they have latterly accomplished. 
Only the solidarity of the Moslem communist organizations 
of the peoples of the East‹and, first and 
foremost, of the Tatars, Bashkirs, Kirghiz and the peoples 
of Turkestan‹can explain those rapid developments 
which we observe in the East. 
I have no doubt, comrades, that this Second Congress, 
which is more comprehensive both quantitatively and 
qualitatively than the First, will be able to continue 
the work already begun of awakening the peoples of 
the East, the work of strengthening the bridge erected 
between West and East, the work of emancipating 
SPEECH AT THE SECOND CONGRESS

J. V. S T A L I N 292 
the working masses from the age-long yoke of imperialism. 
Let us hope that the banner raised at the First 
Congress, the banner of the emancipation of the labouring 
masses of the East, the banner of the destruction 
of imperialism, will be borne with honour to the 
goal by the militants of the Moslem communist organizations.

GREETINGS TO PETROGRAD 
FROM THE SOUTHERN FRONT 
The Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern 
Front expresses comradely thanks for your greetings 
and for the Red banners which you have promised 
the regiments of the Southern Front. 
The Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern 
Front will not forget that Petrograd was the first to 
come to the assistance of the Southern Front by sending 
thousands of advanced and battle-steeled workers, who 
inspired our divisions with faith in victory and completely 
transformed our front. 
It is above all to those workers, the worthy sons of 
Red Petrograd, that the Southern Front owes its latest 
successes. 
Rest assured, comrades, that the troops of the Southern 
Front will justify the expectations of the Russian proletariat, 
and will with honour bear forward the banners 
presented to them until complete victory is won. 
Kiev and Kupyansk are already in our hands, and the 
moment is not far off when the Red banners will be unfurled 
over Rostov and Novocherkassk. 
Greetings to the workers of Petrograd! Greetings to 
the glorious sailors of the Baltic Fleet!

THE MILITARY SITUATION 
IN THE SOUTH 
I 
ABORTIVE PLANS OF THE ENTENTE 
In the spring of 1919 a combined Kolchak-Denikin- 
Yudenich campaign was conceived against Soviet Russia. 
The main blow was to be delivered by Kolchak, with 
whom Denikin hoped to link up in Saratov for a joint advance 
on Moscow from the East. Yudenich was to strike 
an auxiliary blow, at Petrograd. 
The aim of the campaign, as formulated in Guchkov¹s 
report to Denikin, was ³to crush Bolshevism at one 
stroke, by depriving it of its basic vital centres‹Moscow 
and Petrograd.² 
The plan of the campaign was sketched by Denikin 
in a letter to Kolchak which fell into our hands when 
we seized Grishin-Almazov¹s headquarters in the spring 
of 1919. ³The main thing,² Denikin wrote to Kolchak, 
³is not to stop at the Volga, but to drive forward to the 
heart of Bolshevism, Moscow. I hope to meet you in 
Saratov. . . . The Poles will do their work, and as to 
Yudenich, he is ready, and will strike at Petrograd without 
loss of time. . . .² 
That is what Denikin wrote in the spring, when Kolchak¹s 
offensive on the Volga was in full swing.

THE MILITARY SITUATION IN THE SOUTH 295 
However, that plan failed. Kolchak was thrown back 
beyond the Urals. Denikin was halted on the River Seim- 
Liski-Balashov line. Yudenich was pressed back beyond 
Yamburg. 
Soviet Russia remained safe and sound. 
But the Entente cannibals did not lose heart. By the 
autumn of 1919 a plan for a new crushing campaign was 
conceived. Kolchak, naturally, was ruled out. The centre 
of operations was transferred from the East to the 
South, whence Denikin was to strike the main blow. As 
in the spring, Yudenich was to deliver an auxiliary blow 
‹another march on Petrograd. General Mai-Mayevsky, 
the former commander of the Volunteer Army, stated in 
a speech on the day after Orel was captured that he 
would be in Moscow with his troops ³not later than 
the end of December, by Christmas 1919.² 
The Denikinites were so self-confident that already in 
October Donets capitalists were offering a prize of 
one million rubles (in tsarist money) to the regiment 
of the Volunteer Army which first entered Moscow. 
. . . 
But it was the will of fate that this plan, too, should 
fail. Denikin¹s troops were hurled back beyond the Poltava-
Kupyansk-Chertkovo line. Yudenich was routed and 
thrown back beyond the Narva. As to Kolchak, after his 
defeat at Novo-Nikolayevsk, nothing but a memory had 
remained of his army. 
This time, too, Russia remained safe and sound. 
The failure of the counter-revolutionaries this time 
was so unexpected and sudden that the vanquishers of 
imperialist Germany, the old wolves of the Entente, 
were obliged publicly to declare that ³Bolshevism

J. V. S T A L I N 296 
cannot be conquered by force of arms.² The confusion 
of the imperialist fakirs was such that they lost the faculty 
of discerning the real causes of the defeat of the 
counter-revolution, and began to compare Russia, now with 
³shifting sands² where even the ³very best general² was 
sure to fail, now with a ³boundless desert² where even 
the ³best armies² were sure to perish. 
II 
CAUSES OF THE DEFEAT 
OF THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION 
What are the causes of the defeat of the counterrevolution, 
and of Denikin in the first place? 
A) The instability of the rear of the counter-revolutionary 
forces. No army in the world can be victorious 
without a stable rear. Well, Denikin¹s rear (and Kolchak¹s 
too) is quite unstable. This instability of the rear 
of the counter-revolutionary forces is due to the social 
character of the Denikin-Kolchak government which 
mustered these forces. Denikin and Kolchak bring with 
them the yoke not only of the landlords and capitalists, 
but also of British and French capital. The victory 
of Denikin and Kolchak would mean the loss of Russia¹s 
independence, would turn her into a milch cow of the 
British and French plutocrats. In this respect the Denikin- 
Kolchak government is a supremely anti-popular, antinational 
government. In this respect the Soviet Government 
is the only popular and only national government, 
in the best sense of the words, because it 
brings with it not only the emancipation of the working

THE MILITARY SITUATION IN THE SOUTH 297 
people from capitalism, but also the emancipation of the 
whole of Russia from the yoke of world imperialism, the 
conversion of Russia from a colony into an independent 
and free country. 
Is it not obvious that the Denikin-Kolchak government 
and its armies cannot command either the respect 
or the support of the broad strata of the Russian population? 
Is it not obvious that the Denikin-Kolchak armies 
cannot possess that passionate desire for victory and that 
enthusiasm without which victory is altogether impossible? 
The Denikin-Kolchak rear is falling to pieces, and 
is sapping the foundations of the front, because the 
Denikin-Kolchak government is a government which 
spells bondage for the Russian people, a government 
which arouses the maximum distrust among the broad 
strata of the population. 
The rear of the Soviet armies grows stronger and 
stronger and nourishes the Red front with its sap because 
the Soviet Government is a government which is 
emancipating the Russian people and which enjoys 
the maximum confidence of the broad strata of the 
population. 
B) The peripheral position of the counter-revolution. 
Even at the beginning of the October Revolution a certain 
geographical demarcation between the revolution and 
the counter-revolution was to be observed. As the civil 
war developed, the areas of revolution and counter-revolution 
became sharply defined. Inner Russia, with its 
industrial and cultural and political centres, Moscow 
and Petrograd, and with its nationally homogeneous

J. V. S T A L I N 298 
population, principally Russian, became the base of 
the revolution. The border regions of Russia, however 
chiefly the southern and eastern border regions, which 
have no major industrial or cultural and political centres, 
and whose inhabitants are nationally heterogeneous to 
a high degree‹consisting, on the one hand, of privileged 
Cossack colonizers, and, on the other, of subject Tatars 
Bashkirs and Kirghiz (in the East) and Ukrainians, Chechens, 
Ingushes and other, Moslem, peoples‹became the 
base of counter-revolution. 
It will be easily understood that there is nothing 
unnatural in this geographical distribution of the contending 
forces in Russia. For, indeed, who else could constitute 
the base of the Soviet Government, if not the proletariat 
of Petrograd and Moscow? Who else could constitute 
the backbone of the Denikin-Kolchak counterrevolution, 
if not that ancient tool of Russian imperialism, 
the Cossacks, who are privileged and organized 
as a military caste, and who have long exploited the non- 
Russian peoples of the border regions? 
Is it not clear that no other ³geographical distribution² 
was possible? 
But the consequence of this was (and is) a number 
of fatal and inevitable disadvantages for the counter-revolution, 
and an equal number of inevitable advantages 
for the revolution. 
For the success of troops operating in a period of bitter 
civil war it is absolutely essential that the human environment 
whose elements nourish and whose sap sustains 
them should be solid and united. This unity may be national 
(especially in the early phase of civil war), or class 
(especially in the developed phase of civil war). Without

THE MILITARY SITUATION IN THE SOUTH 299 
such unity, prolonged military success is inconceivable. 
But the fact of the matter is that for the armies of Denikin 
and Kolchak, the border regions of Russia (eastern 
and southern) do not, and cannot, either from the national 
or the class standpoint, represent even that 
minimum unity of the human environment without 
which (as I have already said) serious victory is impossible
For, indeed, what national unity can there be between 
the national aspirations of the Tatars, Bashkirs and 
Kirghiz (in the East) and the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushes 
and Ukrainians (in the South), on the one hand, 
and the essentially-Russian autocratic administrations of 
Kolchak and Denikin, on the other? 
Or again: what class unity can there be between the 
privileged Cossacks of the Urals, Orenburg, the Don 
and the Kuban, on the one hand, and, on the other, 
all the other inhabitants of the border regions, not 
excepting the Russian ³inogorodnie,² who have always 
been oppressed and exploited by their neighbours, the 
Cossacks? 
Is it not obvious that armies composed of such heterogeneous 
elements are bound to break up under the first 
serious blow of the Soviet armies, that every such 
blow is bound to increase the gravitation of the non- 
Cossack elements of the border regions of Russia towards 
the Soviet Government, which categorically rejects 
dominant-nation ambitions and willingly meets their 
national aspirations? 
In contradistinction to the border regions, inner 
Russia presents an entirely different picture. Firstly, 
it is nationally united and solid, because nine-tenths of

J. V. S T A L I N 300 
its population consist of Great Russians. Secondly, 
achievement of the class unity of the human environment 
which nourishes the front and the immediate rear of the 
Soviet armies is facilitated by the fact that this environment 
includes the proletariat of Petrograd and Moscow, 
which is popular among the peasants and is rallying them 
solidly around the Soviet Government. 
This, incidentally, explains that striking contact 
in Soviet Russia between rear and front, a contact of 
which the Kolchak-Denikin government has never been 
able to boast. The Soviet Government has only to issue 
a call for assistance to the front for Russia instantly 
to put up a whole array of new regiments. 
It is here, too, that we must seek the source of 
that amazing strength and unparalleled resilience 
which Soviet Russia usually displays at critical moments. 
Here, too, must be sought the explanation of the fact, 
so incomprehensible to the civilized witch doctors of the 
Entente, that ³when the counter-revolutionary armies 
reach certain boundaries (the boundaries of inner Russia!), 
they inevitably sustain disaster. . . .² 
But besides these deep-seated causes of the defeat 
of the counter-revolutionaries, and of Denikin in the first 
place, there are other, more immediate causes (we are 
referring chiefly to the Southern Front). 
They are: 
1) Improvement in the matter of reserves and replenishments 
on the Soviet Southern Front. 
2) Improvement in the matter of supply. 
3) The flow to the front of communist workers from 
Petrograd, Moscow, Tver and Ivanovo-Voznesensk, who

THE MILITARY SITUATION IN THE SOUTH 301 
have joined our southern regiments and completely 
transformed them. 
4) Repair of the machinery of control, which had 
been completely shattered by Mamontov¹s raids. 
5) Skilful resort by the command of the Southern 
Front to flank blows during the offensive. 
6) Methodical character of the offensive itself. 
III 
PRESENT SITUATION 
ON THE SOUTHERN FRONT 
Of all Denikin¹s units, the force that must be regarded 
as the most serious is the Volunteer Army (infantry), because 
it is the most competent and has a large reserve of 
regular officers in its regiments, and Shkuro¹s and Mamontov¹s 
Cavalry Corps. The task of the Volunteer Army 
was to capture Moscow; that of Shkuro¹s and Mamontov¹s 
cavalry was to pierce our southern armies and disrupt 
their rear. 
The first decisive successes of our infantry were scored 
in the battles at Orel, in the Kromy-Dmitrovsk area. 
Here our infantry routed the First (the best) Corps of 
the Volunteer Army, General Kutepov¹s Corps, with its 
Kornilov, Drozdov, Markov and Alexeyev Divisions. 
The first decisive successes of our cavalry were scored 
in the battles at Voronezh, in the area of the rivers 
Ikorets, Usman, Voronezh and Don. Here Comrade Budyonny¹s 
cavalry group first encountered the combined 
forces of Shkuro¹s and Mamontov¹s Corps face to face, 
and overthrew them.

J. V. S T A L I N 302 
Our successes at Orel and Voronezh laid the foundation 
for the subsequent southward advance of our armies. 
The successes at Kiev, Kharkov, Kupyansk and Liski 
were only a sequel and development of our basic successes 
at Orel and Voronezh. The Volunteer Army is now 
retreating in disorder under the pressure of our units, 
with its communications and control disrupted, and having 
lost not less than half its old effectives in killed, 
wounded and captured. It may be confidently offirmed 
that unless i t is withdrawn to the rear and 
thoroughly overhauled, it will soon cease to have any 
fighting capacity. 
As to Shkuro¹s and Mamontov¹s cavalry group, 
although it has been reinforced with two new Kuban 
corps (General Ulagay¹s and General Naumenko¹s) and 
General Chesnokov¹s Composite Division of Uhlans, it 
cannot present any serious threat to our cavalry. This 
was demonstrated in the recent fighting at Lisichansk, 
where the reinforced Shkuro-Mamontov group was utterly 
routed by our cavalry, abandoning seventeen 
guns, eighty machine guns and more than a thousand 
dead. 
Of course it cannot be said that Denikin¹s armies are 
already smashed. Denikin¹s armies have not yet reached 
the degree of decomposition of Kolchak¹s armies. Denikin 
is still capable of certain tactical, and maybe even strategic, 
ruses. Nor should it be forgotten that in ten weeks 
we have succeeded in capturing from Denikin in all only 
about 150 guns, 600 machine guns, 14 armoured 
trains, 150 locomotives, 10,000 railway wagons, and 
16,000 prisoners. But one thing is indubitable: Denikin¹s 
armies are irresistibly following Kolchak¹s down

THE MILITARY SITUATION IN THE SOUTH 303 
the inclined plane, while our armies are growing stronger 
from day to day, both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
Therein lies the guarantee of Denikin¹s ultimate 
destruction.

front was breached by our troops at Taganrog. That,

Denikin¹s front has been pierced, when the Volunteer 
divisions are cut off from Denikin¹s Don and Caucasian 
armies, when in two days¹ fighting at the approaches 
to Taganrog (January 1 and 2) our forces have captured 
from the enemy over two hundred guns, seven armoured 
trains, four tanks and masses of other trophies, 
and when our forces, after liberating Taganrog, are 
besieging the seats of counter-revolution, Novocherkassk 
and Rostov‹now it may quite confidently be said 
that the destruction of Denikin¹s armies is in full swing. 
Another blow, and complete victory will be ensured.

ORDER OF THE DAY 
TO THE UKRAINIAN LABOUR ARMY 
March 7, 1920 
In accordance with directive No. 1247/op/123/sh of 
the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the 
R.S.F.S.R., and Order No. 271 of the Revolutionary 
Military Council of the South-Western Front, the 42nd 
Division is incorporated in the Ukrainian Labour Army 
as from March 7.81 
The gallant 42nd Division, which heroically fought 
the enemies of Russia side by side with other divisions 
at the front, and with them utterly defeated Denikin¹s 
Volunteer Army, must now lay aside its weapons in order 
to give battle to economic disruption and provide the 
country with coal. 
Commanders of the 42nd Division! In the battles 
with Denikin you proved your ability to lead the Red 
Army men from victory to victory‹show now that you 
are capable of gaining no lesser victories in the battle 
with the coal crisis! 
Commissars of the 42nd Division! You proved your 
ability to maintain exemplary order and discipline among 
the Red Army men on the battlefields‹show now that 
you are capable of maintaining the sacred banner of 
labour discipline untarnished in the battle for coal! 
Red Army men of the 42nd Division! You proved 
your ability to fight the enemies of workers¹ and peas

ants¹ Russia honourably and devotedly‹show now 
that you are capable of labouring just as honourably 
and devotedly in transporting coal to the stations, loading 
it into wagons and convoying the coal trains to 
their destination. 
Remember that coal is just as important for Russia 
as victory over Denikin. 
In the Urals, the regiments of the Third Army have 
already distinguished themselves in procuring and transporting 
wood fuel. In the Volga area, the regiments 
of the Reserve Army have covered themselves with glory 
in the work of repairing locomotives and railway wagons. 
The 42nd Division must demonstrate that it is not 
inferior to others by meeting the country¹s needs in transporting, 
loading and conveying coal. 
Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Russia expects this of you.

SPEECHES AT THE FOURTH 
CONFERENCE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
(BOLSHEVIKS) OF THE UKRAINE82 
March 17-23, 1920 
1. SPEECH AT THE OPENING 
OF THE CONFERENCE 
March 17 
Comrades, until now the one basic task confronting 
you, the Communists of the Ukrainian rear and front, 
has been to halt the advance of the Poles, rout Petlura 
and drive out Denikin. This task is being carried 
out successfully, as is now admitted by enemies as well 
as by friends. 
Now that the Ukraine has been delivered from the 
most ferocious enemy of the revolution, Denikin¹s army, 
you have another and no less important and complex 
task before you‹to rehabilitate the Ukraine¹s shattered 
economy. There is no doubt that you, who have succeeded 
in coping with Denikin, will also succeed in coping 
with economic disruption, that you will be able to 
devote all your strength, all that energy which distinguishes 
the Communists from other parties, to checking 
the disruption and aiding your comrades in the North. 
There are symptoms that in the North this task is 
beginning to be fulfilled. The communiques from the 
Labour Armies indicate that more and more railway 
locomotives and wagons are being repaired, and more and

SPEECHES AT THE FOURTH CONFERENCE 307 
more fuel is being produced. The industries of the Urals 
are likewise growing and forging ahead. I have no doubt 
that you will do as well as our comrades in the North. 
The Communists will most assuredly succeed in this 
task, because our Party is solid, united and devoted, and 
because above all this is our motto: ³Finish the work 
begun even if you have to die for it.² Only thanks to its 
discipline and solidarity is the Party able effectively to 
direct thousands of its workers to all the districts and 
regions. This discipline and solidarity enabled us to triumph 
over imperialism, and they permit us to hope 
that we shall likewise triumph over our other enemy‹ 
economic disruption. 
2. REPORT ON ECONOMIC POLICY 
March 19 
I have to report on our immediate tasks in the sphere 
of economic construction. 
A year ago, when our Federation was surrounded by 
a tight ring of armies subsidized by the international 
imperialists, the Council of Defence issued the slogan: 
³Everything for the front!² This meant that all our 
constructive efforts had to be concentrated on the supply 
and reinforcement of the front. A year¹s experience has 
shown that the Council of Defence was right, for in this 
year our ferocious enemies were hurled back‹Yudenich, 
Kolchak and Denikin have been as good as routed. 
Thus the slogan ³Everything for the front!² has been put 
into practice and has yielded good results. 
A couple of months ago the Council of Defence issued 
another slogan: ³Everything for the national economy!²

J. V. S T A L I N 308 
This means that all our constructive work must be put 
on a new, an economic footing, that all our vital forces 
must be brought to the economic altar. This, however, 
does not mean that we no longer have any military 
task. Two attempts of the Entente to strike down 
Soviet Federative Russia‹the first from the East, with 
the help of Kolchak, and the second from the South, 
with the help of Denikin‹have failed. Now, apparently, 
a new blow is being planned‹from the West. The Entente 
is not so stupid as not to exploit the forces of the Polish 
gentry, if only with the object of preventing our Federation 
from tackling new constructive tasks. Moreover, we do 
not yet know what immediate prospects open out in connection 
with the German coup.83 Evidently, the West 
is pregnant with certain new, but quite apparent complications. 
It therefore must not be said that, in redirecting 
all our efforts to the work of rehabilitating 
the national economy, we are turning our backs on 
the military tasks. Nevertheless, the basic slogan must 
always be basic. 
What induced the Council of Defence and the Central 
Committee of our Party to issue the new slogan? The 
fact, comrades, that on looking about us after the defeat 
of the external enemy, we found a picture of utter economic 
disruption. 
What problems are involved in the task of repairing 
the war-shattered national economy? 
The basic problem in the restoration of the national 
economy is fuel. All imperialist wars have been fought 
for the sake of fuel. All the stratagems of the Entente 
were designed to deprive us of fuel.

SPEECHES AT THE FOURTH CONFERENCE 309 
There are three types of fuel: coal, oil and wood. 
Let us begin with the problem of coal. 
In 1916, i . e . , before the revolution, we used to 
produce not less than 140-150 million poods of coal each 
month, and sent out not less than 120 million poods 
to other parts. Now we are producing not more than 
18 million poods of coal and anthracite, and are sending 
out not more than 4-5 million poods. The picture is 
clear. 
The second type of fuel is oil. Our chief source of 
oil fuel is the Baku area. In 1916, we secured in all 
about 500 million poods of oil from Baku, some 100 million 
from Grozny, and about 15 million from the Urals 
(Emba). As you know, our chief source of oil‹Baku‹ 
is not in our hands. Grozny is not worth talking about. 
In what state it will be when we get it back I do not 
know. As a fuel source, it possesses very rich oil deposits. 
Its output last year was as high as 200 million poods. But 
in what state we shall get it back, I do not know. All we 
know is that the Whites have wrecked it thoroughly. 
The third type of fuel is wood. In former days, measured 
in terms of coal, about 500 million poods of wood 
fuel were obtained annually. The output now is not more 
than 50 per cent of this amount, according to the estimates 
of the Chief Timber Committee. 
As you see, as far as fuel is concerned our situation 
is critical. 
The second problem is iron and steel. To all intents and 
purposes, almost our only source of ore, pig iron and finished 
products was, and is, the Donets-Krivoy Rog Basin. 
Pig iron output in 1916 was not less than 16 million poods 
each month. We had not less than 65 blast furnaces operating

J. V. S T A L I N 310 
in the Donbas. Not a single one of the 65 is operating today. 
In 1916 our iron and steel plants produced some 14 million 
poods of semi-manufactures each month. They are 
now producing not more than five per cent of this figure. 
In 1916 we produced about 12 million poods of 
finished products each month. Today‹two or three 
per cent of this figure. As far as iron and steel are concerned, 
we are in a pretty bad way too. 
The third problem is grain. If we are to restore industry, 
we must feed the workers. Lack of grain is our chief 
handicap and the chief cause of our industrial paralysis. 
Before the war we used to harvest some 5,000 million 
poods of grain annually in the territory of the Federation. 
Of this, over 500 million poods were exported to 
other countries. All the rest went for internal consumption. 
Even in 1914, when the war began and the frontiers 
closed, we managed to export some 300 million poods 
of grain in ten months. Subsequently, exports dropped 
to 30 million poods. 
All this indicates that there are, as there must be, 
surpluses of grain in the country. Obviously, if we are 
asked whether the objective possibility exists of securing 
grain and creating that grain reserve without which it 
will be impossible to set industry on its feet, we can answer 
that it undoubtedly does exist. For us to procure the 
300 million pood reserve which our comrades talk so loudly 
about is, objectively speaking, quite possible. The whole 
problem is to create a flexible machinery, to give heed 
to the sentiment of the peasants, to display patience and 
proficiency, and to assign to this work forces possessing 
the necessary managerial ability to turn word into deed. 
In this matter I could cite our experience in the

SPEECHES AT THE FOURTH CONFERENCE 311 
Ukraine. Not so long ago it was estimated that at least 
600 million poods of grain of the last harvest had accumulated 
in the Ukraine. With a certain effort, these six 
hundred million poods might have been procured. But 
our food agencies decided to issue a demand for not more 
than 160 million poods, and further decided that it would 
be possible to obtain about 40 million poods by March. 
But this amount was not secured. Owing to the laxity 
of our agencies, and because of the regular manhunt 
conducted by Makhno¹s men against our food officials, 
and because of the kulak revolts in a number of districts, 
we succeeded in obtaining only about two million 
poods instead of forty million. 
The next problem is sugar. In 1916 we produced 
about 115 million poods of sugar. Requirements amounted 
to 100 million poods. Today we have only about three 
million. 
Such is the state of our war-shattered national economy 
today. 
This state of the Federation¹s economic affairs naturally 
compels us to issue the slogan: ³Everything for the 
national economy!² 
What does this slogan imply? What it amounts to 
is that all agitational and constructive work must be 
re-organized along new, economic lines. We shall now 
have to promote economic non-commissioned officers and 
officers from the ranks of the workers to teach the people 
how to battle against economic disruption and build a 
new economy. Only in the course of the battle against 
the disruption will new constructive work be possible, 
and this requires the training of officers of labour. If 
last year we arranged emulation among the military

J. V. S T A L I N 312 
units, now we must do the same thing among the workers 
in our industrial establishments, in the mills and factories, 
on the railways, in the mines. Evidently, we shall 
have to draw not only the workers, but also the peasants 
and other labouring elements into this movement. 
Next, it should be observed, in addition to all that has 
been said, that the local economic bodies, especially the 
regional and district ones, will have to be granted more 
extensive rights, more independence in the matter of rehabilitating 
industry than has been the case hitherto. The 
position until now was that the work was directed by the 
Chief Boards, and the Chief Boards alone; now we shall 
have to pay special attention to the localities and give them 
the opportunity, at last, to display their initiative, without 
which it will be difficult to get our economy on its feet. 
Lastly, we must pay attention to supporting the organizations 
which the Council of Defence has converted 
from military to economic work. I refer to the Councils of 
the Labour Armies. Experience has shown that it is not 
always expedient mechanically to assign whole army 
units to economic work. Here we have to arrange a certain 
co-ordination between the work of the reserve units 
and of the working people in the rear. 
Passing to the Ukrainian Labour Army, I must say 
that for a number of reasons it has only recently started 
work. The first task was to find out the present situation, 
and then to consider what practical measures were necessary. 
What we found out presents a dismal picture. Railway 
transport is in a particularly bad way. It must be said 
that on the four Ukrainian railways‹the South-Western, 
the South, the Donets and the Yekaterininskaya‹ 
there are quite a number of locomotives, but 70 per

SPEECHES AT THE FOURTH CONFERENCE 313 
cent of them are out of order. The consequence is that, 
instead of the 45 pairs of trains which used to run daily 
on the Kharkov-Moscow line, we now manage to run only 
four or five, at most eight, pairs. 
Having gathered all this information about the situation 
in the Ukraine, the Labour Army Council decided 
on a number of practical measures, of which I must 
mention the following: 
First, to militarize labour in the coal industry, and 
also to mobilize the rural population for labour duty in 
transporting coal. 
Secondly, to bring new forces from among the workers 
into industry, because we know that of the 250,000 workers 
engaged in industry before the revolution, only 
80,000 remain. But in order to enlist these new forces, 
arrangements must first be made for their food supply, 
and we are adopting a number of measures in this 
direction. 
Thirdly, to set up a Central Board at the head 
of the coal industry, which would have under its direction 
a health administration, a communications department, 
a supply department, a military tribunal and a 
political department. 
All this is necessary in order to get the industries 
and transport services of the Ukraine going properly, to 
ensure the regular supply of man power, food, medical 
aid and political workers, to discourage self-seekers 
and labour deserters from sneaking out of the Donets 
Basin, and to implant labour discipline in industry and 
transport. By arrangement with the Central Committee 
of the Russian Communist Party and the Central Committee 
of the Ukraine, from now on the Chairman of

J. V. S T A L I N 314 
the Donets Gubernia Committee of the Communist Party 
will also be chief of the Political Department of the coal 
industry. All distribution of Party forces and their transfer 
from district to district for duty in the coal industry 
will now come within the jurisdiction of the 
Political Department. 
These, in general, are the measures which must be 
carried out if we are to start work on repairing the warshattered 
national economy of the Federation and put 
it on the way to its maximum development. 
Concluding my report, I submit for your attention 
the theses of the C.C., R.C.P. on economic construction.84 
3. REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE REPORT 
ON ECONOMIC POLICY 
March 20 
It is to be noted that none of the delegates attempted 
to put forward any other resolution in opposition 
to the Central Committee¹s theses. The resolution of 
the Kharkov Conference is only an addendum to the 
resolutions of the Seventh Congress of Soviets,85 and 
one which does not touch upon a whole series of problems 
dealt with in the Central Committee¹s theses 
concerning the immediate tasks of economic construction. 
I have already said that the basic task now is to 
rehabilitate the coal industry. In view of this, the Council 
of the Ukrainian Labour Army is concentrating its chief 
attention on organizing a coal industry board capable 
of ensuring regular supply and implanting discipline 
in the industry.

SPEECHES AT THE FOURTH CONFERENCE 315 
As you know, our industry throughout the Federation 
is just now passing through a phase of laxity and guerilla 
mentality similar to the phase the Red Army was in 
a year and a half ago. At that time the Party centre 
issued a call to pull the army together, to implant 
discipline, and to convert the guerilla units into regular 
units. The same thing must be done now with respect 
to industry, which has broken down. This broken down 
industry must be pulled together and organized, otherwise 
we shall not extricate ourselves from the chaos. 
One comrade said here that the workers do not fear 
militarization, because the better workers are sick and 
tired of the lack of order. That is perfectly true. The 
workers are sick and tired of mismanagement, and they 
will gladly accept leadership capable of introducing 
order and implanting labour discipline in industry. 
4. SPEECH AT THE CLOSING 
OF THE CONFERENCE 
March 23 
In his closing speech, Comrade Stalin summed up 
the work of the All-Ukrainian Conference. He gave an 
appraisal of the decisions taken on various questions, 
dwelling on the resolutions adopted on work in the 
countryside and in economic construction. The latter 
question will be finally decided at the Ninth Congress 
of the R.C.P.86 
³The cardinal problem of our policy‹work in the 
countryside‹has, in my opinion, been settled correctly,² 
he said. ³I consider that here, in the Ukraine, 
we are passing through the same stage of development

J. V. S T A L I N 316 
in the countryside as that in Russia a year and a half 
ago, when the Volga area and many areas of Central 
Russia were in a phase of revolt. This period will become 
a thing of the past here as it has in Russia. 
³In our work in the countryside we have to rely upon 
the poor peasant. The middle peasant will come over 
to our side only when he becomes convinced that the 
Soviet regime is strong. Only then will the middle peasant 
side with us. 
³From these considerations it may be said that the 
resolution you have adopted is unquestionably correct. 
³There is another important question which was 
decided at the conference, namely, the affiliation of the 
Borotbists87 to our Party. The Borotbists are a party 
which drew its nourishment from the countryside. Now 
that the Borotbists have merged with our Party, we are 
in a position to implement the alliance between the 
proletariat and the poor peasants in full measure. As 
you know, this alliance is the basis of the might and 
strength of our Federative Republic. 
³Permit me to congratulate you on the fruitful work 
of your conference. 
³I hereby declare the conference closed.² (Applause.)

LENIN AS THE ORGANISER AND LEADER 
OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST PARTY 
There are two groups of Marxists. Both work under 
the flag of Marxism and consider themselves ³genuinely² 
Marxist. Nevertheless, they are by no means identical. 
More, a veritable gulf divides them, for their methods 
of work are diametrically opposed to each other. 
The first group usually confines itself to an outward 
acceptance, to a ceremonial avowal of Marxism. Being 
unable or unwilling to grasp the essence of Marxism, 
being unable or unwilling to put it into practice, it 
converts the living, revolutionary principles of Marxism 
into lifeless, meaningless formulas. It does not base its 
activities on experience, on what practical work teaches, 
but on quotations from Marx. It does not derive its 
instructions and directions from an analysis of living 
reality, but from analogies and historical parallels. Discrepancy 
between word and deed is the chief malady of 
this group. Hence the disillusionment and perpetual grudge 
against fate, which time and again lets it down and makes 
a ³dupe² of it. The name for this group is Menshevism 
(in Russia), opportunism (in Europe). Comrade Tyszka 
(Jogiches) described this group very aptly at the London 
Congress88 when he said that it does not stand by, 
but lies down on the point of view of Marxism.

J. V. S T A L I N 318 
The second group, on the contrary, attaches prime 
importance not to the outward acceptance of Marxism, 
but to its realization, its application in practice. What 
this group chiefly concentrates its attention on is determining 
the ways and means of realizing Marxism that 
best answer the situation, and changing these ways and 
means as the situation changes. It does not derive its 
directions and instructions from historical analogies and 
parallels, but from a study of surrounding conditions. It 
does not base its activities on quotations and maxims, 
but on practical experience, testing every step by experience, 
learning from its mistakes and teaching others 
how to build a new life. That, in fact, explains why there 
is no discrepancy between word and deed in the activities 
of this group, and why the teachings of Marx completely 
retain their living, revolutionary force. To this group 
may be fully applied Marx¹s saying that Marxists cannot 
rest content with interpreting the world, but must go 
further and change it.89 The name for this group is Bolshevism, 
communism. 
The organizer and leader of this group is V. I. Lenin. 
I 
LENIN AS THE ORGANIZER 
OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST PARTY 
The formation of the proletarian party in Russia 
took place under special conditions, differing from those 
prevailing in the West at the time the workers¹ party 
was formed there. Whereas in the West, in France and 
in Germany, the workers¹ party emerged from the trade 
unions at a time when trade unions and parties were

LENIN AS THE ORGANISER AND LEADER OF THE R.C.P. 319 
legal, when the bourgeois revolution had already taken 
place, when bourgeois parliaments existed, when 
the bourgeoisie, having climbed into power, found itself 
confronted by the proletariat‹in Russia, on the 
contrary, the formation of the proletarian party took 
place under a most ferocious absolutism, in expectation 
of a bourgeois-democratic revolution; at a time 
when, on the one hand, the Party organizations were 
filled to overflowing with bourgeois ³legal Marxists² 
who were thirsting to utilize the working class for the 
bourgeois revolution, and when, on the other hand, 
the tsarist gendarmerie was robbing the Party¹s ranks 
of its best workers, while the growth of a spontaneous 
revolutionary movement called for the existence of a 
staunch, compact and sufficiently secret fighting core 
of revolutionaries, capable of directing the movement 
to the overthrow of absolutism. 
The task was to separate the sheep from the goats, 
to dissociate oneself from alien elements, to organize 
cadres of experienced revolutionaries in the localities, 
to provide them with a clear programme and firm tactics, 
and, lastly, to gather these cadres into a single, 
militant organization of professional revolutionaries, 
sufficiently secret to withstand the onslaughts of the 
gendarmes, but at the same time sufficiently connected 
with the masses to lead them into battle at the required 
moment. 
The Mensheviks, the people who ³lie down² on the 
point of view of Marxism, settled the question very simply: 
inasmuch as the workers¹ party in the West had emerged 
from non-party trade unions fighting for the improvement 
of the economic conditions of the working class,

J. V. S T A L I N 320 
the same, as far as possible, should happen in Russia; 
that is, the ³economic struggle of the workers against 
the employers and the government² in the localities was 
enough for the time being, no all-Russian militant 
organization should be created, and later . . . well, 
later, if trade unions did not arise by that time, a nonparty 
labour congress should be called and proclaimed 
as the party. 
That this ³Marxist² ³plan² of the Mensheviks, utopian 
though it was under Russian conditions, nevertheless 
entailed extensive agitational work designed to disparage 
the notion of the Party principle, to destroy the Party 
cadres, to leave the proletariat without its own party and 
to surrender the working class to the tender mercies of 
the liberals‹the Mensheviks, and perhaps a good many 
Bolsheviks too, hardly suspected at the time. 
The immense service Lenin rendered the Russian 
proletariat and its Party was that he exposed the whole 
danger of the Mensheviks¹ ³plan² of organization at a 
time when this ³plan² was still in embryo, when even 
its authors perceived its outlines with difficulty, and, 
having exposed it, opened a furious attack on the laxity 
of the Mensheviks in matters of organization and concentrated 
the whole attention of the Party¹s practical 
workers on this question. For the very existence of the 
Party was at stake; it was a matter of life or death for 
the Party. 
To establish an all-Russian political newspaper as 
a rallying centre of Party forces, to organize staunch 
Party cadres in the localities as ³regular units² of the 
Party, to organize these cadres into one entity through 
the medium of the newspaper, and to weld them into

LENIN AS THE ORGANISER AND LEADER OF THE R.C.P. 321 
an all-Russian militant party with sharply-defined limits, 
with a clear programme, firm tactics and a single 
will‹such was the plan that Lenin developed in his 
famous books, What Is To Be Done?90 and One Step Forward, 
Two Steps Back.91 The merit of this plan lay in 
the fact that it fully conformed to Russian realities, and 
that it generalized in masterly fashion the organizational 
experience of the best of the practical workers. In the 
struggle for this plan, the majority of the Russian 
practical workers resolutely followed Lenin and were not 
deterred by a possible split. The victory of this plan 
laid the foundation for that close-knit and steeled Communist 
Party which has no equal in the world. 
Our comrades (not only the Mensheviks!) often accused 
Lenin of an excessive inclination towards controversy 
and splits, of being relentless in his struggle against conciliators, 
and so on. At one time this was undoubtedly 
the case. But it will be easily understood that our Party 
could not have rid itself of internal weakness and 
diffuseness, that it could not have attained its characteristic 
vigour and strength if it had not expelled the 
non-proletarian, opportunist elements from its midst. 
In the epoch of bourgeois rule, a proletarian party can 
grow and gain strength only to the extent that it combats 
the opportunist, anti-revolutionary and anti-party 
elements in its own midst and within the working class. 
Lassalle was right when he said: ³The party becomes 
strong by purging itself.²92 
The accusers usually cited the German party, in 
which ³unity² at that time flourished. But, in the first 
place, not every kind of unity is a sign of strength, and 
secondly, one has only to glance at the late German

J. V. S T A L I N 322 
party, rent into three parties,93 to realize the utter falsity 
and fictitiousness of ³unity² between Scheidemann and 
Noske, on the one hand, and Liebknecht and Luxemburg, 
on the other. And who knows whether it would 
not have been better for the German proletariat if the 
revolutionary elements of the German party had split 
away from its anti-revolutionary elements in time? . . . 
No, Lenin was a thousand times right in leading the 
Party along the path of uncompromising struggle against 
the anti-Party and anti-revolutionary elements. For it 
was only because of such a policy of organization 
that our Party was able to create that internal unity 
and astonishing cohesion which enabled it to emerge 
unscathed from the July crisis during the Kerensky regime, 
to bear the brunt of the October uprising, to pass 
through the crisis of the Brest period unshaken, to 
organize the victory over the Entente, and, lastly, to 
acquire that unparalleled flexibility which permits it 
at any moment to re-form its ranks and to concentrate 
hundreds of thousands of its members on any big task 
without causing confusion in its midst. 
II 
LENIN AS THE LEADER 
OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST PARTY 
But the merits of the Russian Communist Party in the 
field of organization are only one aspect of the matter. The 
Party could not have grown and become strong so quickly 
if the political content of its work, its programme and 
tactics had not conformed to Russian realities, if its 
slogans had not fired the masses of the workers and had

LENIN AS THE ORGANISER AND LEADER OF THE R.C.P. 323 
not impelled the revolutionary movement forward. Let 
us pass to this aspect of the matter. 
The Russian bourgeois-democratic revolution (1905) 
took place under conditions differing from those that 
prevailed during the revolutionary upheavals in the West, 
in France and Germany, for example. Whereas the 
revolution in the West took place under the conditions of 
the manufacturing period of capitalism and of an undeveloped 
class struggle, when the proletariat was weak and 
numerically small and did not have its own party to 
formulate its demands, while the bourgeoisie was sufficiently 
revolutionary to win the confidence of the 
workers and peasants and to lead them into the struggle 
against the aristocracy‹in Russia, on the other 
hand, the revolution began (1905) under the conditions of 
the machine-industry period of capitalism and of a developed 
class struggle, when the Russian proletariat, relatively 
numerous and welded together by capitalism, had 
already fought a number of battles with the bourgeoisie, 
had its own party, which was more united than the bourgeois 
party, and its own class demands, while the Russian 
bourgeoisie, which, moreover, subsisting on government 
contracts, was sufficiently scared by the revolutionary 
temper of the proletariat to seek an alliance with the 
government and the landlords against the workers and 
peasants. The fact that the Russian revolution broke out 
as a result of the military reverses suffered on the fields 
of Manchuria only accelerated events without essentially 
changing the state of affairs. 
The situation demanded that the proletariat should 
take the lead of the revolution, rally the revolutionary 
peasants around itself and wage a determined fight

J. V. S T A L I N 324 
against tsardom and the bourgeoisie simultaneously, 
with a view to establishing complete democracy in the 
country and ensuring its own class interests. 
But the Mensheviks, the people who ³lie down² 
on the point of view of Marxism, settled the question in 
their own fashion: since the Russian revolution is a 
bourgeois revolution, and since it is the representatives 
of the bourgeoisie that lead bourgeois revolutions (see 
the ³history² of the French and German revolutions), 
the proletariat cannot exercise hegemony in the Russian 
revolution, the leadership should be left to the Russian 
bourgeoisie (the very bourgeoisie that was betraying 
the revolution); the peasantry should also be handed 
over to the tutelage of the bourgeoisie, while the proletariat 
should remain an extreme Left opposition. 
And that vulgar medley of the tunes of the wretched 
liberals the Mensheviks passed off as the last word in 
³genuine² Marxism! . . . 
The immense service Lenin rendered the Russian 
revolution was that he utterly exposed the futility of 
the Mensheviks¹ historical parallels and the whole danger 
of the Menshevik ³scheme of revolution² which surrendered 
the cause of the workers to the tender mercies of 
the bourgeoisie. The revolutionary democratic dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry, instead of the 
dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; boycott of the Bulygin 
Duma94 and armed uprising, instead of participating in 
the Duma and carrying on organic work within it; the 
idea of a ³Left bloc,² when the Duma was after all convened, 
and the utilization of the Duma platform for 
the struggle outside the Duma, instead of a Cadet 
Ministry and the reactionary ³cherishing² of the Duma;

LENIN AS THE ORGANISER AND LEADER OF THE R.C.P. 325 
the fight against the Cadet Party as a counter-revolutionary 
force, instead of forming a ³bloc² with it‹such was 
the tactical plan which Lenin developed in his famous 
pamphlets, Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic 
Revolution95 and The Victory of the Cadets and the 
Tasks of the Workers¹ Party.96 
The merit of this plan lay in the fact that it bluntly 
and resolutely formulated the class demands of the 
proletariat in the epoch of the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
in Russia, facilitated the transition to the socialist 
revolution, and contained in embryo the idea of 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. The majority of the 
Russian practical workers resolutely and unswervingly 
followed Lenin in the struggle for this tactical plan. The 
victory of this plan laid the foundation for those revolutionary 
tactics thanks to which our Party is now shaking 
the foundations of world imperialism. 
The subsequent development of events; the four 
years of imperialist war and the shattering of the whole 
economic life of the country; the February Revolution 
and the celebrated dual power; the Provisional Government, 
which was a hotbed of bourgeois counter-revolution, 
and the Petrograd Soviet of Deputies, which was 
the form of the incipient proletarian dictatorship; the 
October Revolution and the dispersal of the Constituent 
Assembly; the abolition of bourgeois parliamentarism 
and the proclamation of the Republic of Soviets; the 
transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war 
and the offensive of world imperialism, together with 
the professed ³Marxists,² against the proletarian revolution; 
and, lastly, the pitiable position of the Mensheviks, 
who clung to the Constituent Assembly and

J. V. S T A L I N 326 
who were thrown overboard by the proletariat and driven 
by the waves of revolution to the shores of capitalism‹ 
all this only confirmed the correctness of the principles 
of the revolutionary tactics formulated by Lenin in his 
Two Tactics. A party with such a heritage could sail 
boldly forward, without fear of submerged rocks. 
In our time of proletarian revolution, when every 
Party slogan and every utterance of a leader is tested 
in action, the proletariat makes special demands of its 
leaders. History knows of proletarian leaders who were 
leaders in times of storm, practical leaders, self-sacrificing 
and courageous, but who were weak in theory. The names 
of such leaders are not soon forgotten by the masses. 
Such, for example, were Lassalle in Germany and Blanqui 
in France. But the movement as a whole cannot live 
on reminiscences alone: it must have a clear goal (a 
programme), and a firm line (tactics). 
There is another type of leader‹peacetime leaders, 
who are strong in theory, but weak in matters of organization 
and practical work. Such leaders are popular 
only among an upper layer of the proletariat, and then 
only up to a certain time. When the epoch of revolution 
sets in, when practical revolutionary slogans are demanded 
of the leaders, the theoreticians quit the stage and give 
way to new men. Such, for example, were Plekhanov 
in Russia and Kautsky in Germany. 
To retain the post of leader of the proletarian revolution 
and of the proletarian party, one must combine strength 
in theory with experience in the practical organization 
of the proletarian movement. P. Axelrod, when he was

LENIN AS THE ORGANISER AND LEADER OF THE R.C.P. 327 
a Marxist, wrote of Lenin that he ³happily combines the 
experience of a good practical worker with a theoretical 
education and a broad political outlook² (see P. Axelrod¹s 
preface to Lenin¹s pamphlet: The Tasks of the 
Russian Social-Democrats97). What Mr. Axelrod, the ideologist 
of ³civilized² capitalism, would say now about 
Lenin is not difficult to guess. But we who know Lenin 
well and can judge matters objectively have no doubt 
that Lenin has fully retained this old quality. It is 
here, incidentally, that one must seek the reason why 
it is Lenin, and no one else, who is today the leader of 
the strongest and most steeled proletarian party in the 
world.

SPEECH DELIVERED AT A MEETING 
CALLED BY THE MOSCOW 
COMMITTEE, R.C.P. (B.) 
ON THE OCCASION OF V. I. LENIN¹S 
FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY 
April 23, 1920 
After the speeches and reminiscences we have heard 
here, very little remains for me to say. I should like only 
to mention one feature of Comrade Lenin¹s of which 
nobody has yet spoken, namely, his modesty and his 
courage in acknowledging mistakes. 
I recall two occasions when Lenin, that giant, admitted 
that he had been in the wrong. 
The first episode relates to the decision on boycotting 
the Witte Duma, taken in Tammerfors, Finland, in 
December 1905, at the All-Russian Bolshevik Conference.
98 The question of boycotting the Witte Duma had 
then to be decided. A group of seven, closely associated 
with Comrade Lenin, and on whom we provincial delegates 
used to bestow all kinds of epithets, had assured 
us that Ilyich was opposed to boycotting the Duma and 
in favour of taking part in the elections. This, as it turned 
out later, was actually so. But the debate opened, and the 
pro-boycotters from the provinces, from St. Petersburg, 
Moscow, Siberia and the Caucasus went into the attack, 
and what was our surprise when, after we had spoken, 
Lenin got up and declared that he had been in favour of

SPEECH AT A MEETING CALLED BY THE MOSCOW COMMITTEE 329 
taking part in the elections, but he saw now that he had 
been wrong and associated himself with the delegates 
from the provinces. We were astounded. It had the effect 
of an electric shock. We cheered him to the echo. 
Here is another episode of a similar character. In 
September 1917, under Kerensky, at the time when the 
Democratic Conference had been convened and the Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries were contriving a 
new institution, the Pre-parliament, which was to pave 
the way for a transition from the Soviets to a Constituent 
Assembly, at that moment we in the Central Committee 
in Petrograd decided not to disperse the Democratic Conference, 
and to go ahead strengthening the Soviets, to convene 
a Congress of Soviets, start an uprising and proclaim 
the Congress of Soviets the organ of state power. 
Ilyich, who at that time was living in hiding outside 
Petrograd, did not agree with the Central Committee 
and wrote that the scum (meaning the Democratic Conference) 
should be dispersed and arrested right away. 
It seemed to us that the matter was not quite so simple, 
for we knew that a half, or at least a third, of the 
members of the Democratic Conference were delegates 
from the front, and that by arresting and dispersing the 
Conference we might only spoil matters and damage our 
relations with the front. We considered that all the 
bumps and pitfalls on our path were clearer to us, the 
practical workers. But Ilyich was a great man; he 
was not afraid of bumps and pitfalls, he did not fear 
danger, and said: ³Rise and march straight to the goal!² 
We, the practical workers, on the other hand, believed 
that no good could come of acting in this way at 
that time, that the thing to do was to skirt around the

J. V. S T A L I N 330 
obstacles in order to take the bull by the horns later. 
And despite all Ilyich¹s insistence, we did not listen to 
him and went on strengthening the Soviets, and to such 
effect as to end up with the Congress of Soviets of October 
25 and the successful uprising. Ilyich was already in 
Petrograd by then. Smiling and glancing at us slyly, he 
said: ³Yes, it seems you were right.² 
Again we were astounded. 
Comrade Lenin was not afraid of acknowledging his 
mistakes. 
It was this modesty and courage that particularly 
captivated us. (Applause.)

THE ENTENTE¹S NEW CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST RUSSIA 
It is beyond all doubt that the campaign of the Polish 
gentry against workers¹ and peasants¹ Russia is in 
actual fact a campaign of the Entente. The point is 
not only that the League of Nations, which is led by 
the Entente and of which Poland is a member, has 
evidently approved Poland¹s campaign against Russia. 
The chief point is that without the Entente¹s support 
Poland could not have organized her attack on Russia, 
that France in the first place, and also Britain and 
America, are doing all they can to support Poland¹s 
offensive with arms, equipment, money and instructors. 
Disagreements within the Entente over the Polish question 
do not affect the matter, for they concern only 
the ways of supporting Poland, and not the support itself. 
Nor is the matter affected by Curzon¹s diplomatic 
correspondence with Comrade Chicherin,99 or by the ostentatious 
anti-intervention articles in the British press, 
because all this hullabaloo has only one object, namely, 
to throw dust in the eyes of naive politicians and 
by talking about peace with Russia to cover up the foul 
work of the actual armed intervention organized by the 
Entente.

THE GENERAL SITUATION 
The Entente¹s present campaign is the third in succession. 
The first campaign was launched in the spring of 
1919. It was a combined campaign, because it envisaged 
a joint attack by Kolchak, Denikin, Poland, Yudenich and 
composite Anglo-Russian detachments in Turkestan and. 
Arkhangelsk, the main weight of the attack being in 
Kolchak¹s area. 
At that period the Entente was solid and united and 
stood for open intervention: the weakness of the labour 
movement in the West, the number of Soviet Russia¹s 
enemies, and their complete confidence in victory over 
Russia, enabled the bosses of the Entente to pursue a 
brazen policy of undisguised intervention. 
At that period Russia was in a critical state, because 
she was cut off from the grain areas (Siberia, the Ukraine, 
the Northern Caucasus) and fuel sources (the Donets 
Basin, Grozny, Baku) and was forced to fight on six 
fronts. The Entente saw this and gloated over i t s 
anticipated victory. The Times was already beating the 
drums. 
Nevertheless, Russia passed through this crisis safely, 
and her most powerful enemy, Kolchak, was put out of 
action. The point is that Russia¹s rear, and hence also her 
army, proved to be more stable and flexible than the 
rear and armies of her adversaries. 
The Entente¹s second campaign was launched in the 
autumn of 1919. It, too, was a combined campaign, because 
it envisaged a joint attack by Denikin, Poland and

THE ENTENTE¹S NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST RUSSIA 333 
Yudenich (Kolchak had been written off the accounts). 
This time the weight of the attack was in the South, in 
Denikin¹s area. 
At this period the Entente for the first time began 
to experience internal disagreements. For the first time 
it began to moderate its insolent tone, intimated its 
opposition to open intervention, proclaimed the permissibility 
of negotiations with Russia, and proceeded 
to withdraw its troops from the North. The growth of 
the revolutionary movement in the West and Kolchak¹s 
defeat had evidently made the former policy of 
open intervention unsafe for the Entente. It no 
longer dared to speak openly of undisguised intervention. 
Despite the victory over Kolchak and the recovery 
of one of the grain areas (Siberia), Russia in this 
period was again in a critical state, because the main 
enemy, Denikin, stood at the gates of Tula, the chief 
source of supply of cartridges, rifles and machine guns 
for our army. Nevertheless, Russia emerged safe and 
sound from this crisis too. And for the same reason, 
namely, the greater stability and flexibility of our rear, 
and hence also of our army. 
The Entente¹s third campaign is being launched in 
a quite new situation. To begin with, unlike the previous 
campaigns, this campaign cannot be called a combined 
one, for not only have the Entente¹s old allies (Kolchak, 
Denikin, Yudenich) dropped out, but no new ones (if 
there are any) have yet joined in, if we disregard the 
ludicrous Petlura and ³his² ludicrous ³army.² Poland is 
so far facing Russia alone, without any serious fighting 
allies

J. V. S T A L I N 334 
Further, the notorious blockade has been broken not 
only morally and practically, but also formally. The Entente 
is forced to reconcile itself to the necessity of diplomatic 
relations with Russia and to tolerate official 
representatives of Russia in the West. The mass revolutionary 
movement in the European countries, which is 
adopting the slogans of the Third International, and 
the new successes of the Soviet armies in the East are 
widening the division within the Entente, enhancing 
Russia¹s prestige in the neutral and border states, and 
rendering the Entente¹s policy of isolating Russia utopian. 
Estland, that ³natural² ally of Poland, has been 
neutralized. Latvia and Lithuania, who yesterday were 
Poland¹s fighting allies, are today conducting peace negotiations 
with Russia. The same may be said of Finland. 
Lastly, Russia¹s internal position at the opening of 
the Entente¹s third campaign must be regarded as having 
radically changed for the better. Russia has not only 
opened the road to the grain and fuel areas (Siberia, the 
Ukraine, the Northern Caucasus, the Donets Basin, Grozny, 
Baku), but has reduced the number of fronts from six 
to two, and is therefore in a position to mass troops in the 
West. 
To what has been said must be added the very important 
fact that Poland is the attacking side, having rejected 
Russia¹s peace proposals, and Russia the defending 
side, which is an enormous and inestimable moral advantage 
for Russia. 
All these circumstances create a new situation, new 
chances for a Russian victory which did not exist at the 
time of the earlier, the first and second, Entente campaigns 
against Russia.

THE ENTENTE¹S NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST RUSSIA 335 
That, chiefly, explains the gloomy and sceptical 
tone in which the Western imperialist press evaluates 
the successes of the Polish army. 
II 
REAR. STRIKING AREA 
No army in the world can be victorious (we are 
speaking of firm and enduring victory, of course) without 
a stable rear. The rear is of prime importance to the 
front, because it is from the rear, and the rear alone, 
that the front obtains not only all kinds of supplies, 
but also its man power‹its fighting forces, sentiments 
and ideas. An unstable rear, and so much the more 
a hostile rear, i s bound to turn the best and most 
united army into an unstable and crumbling mass. The 
weakness of Kolchak and Denikin was due to the fact 
that they had no rear of ³their own,² that they, imbued 
as they were with essentially-Russian dominant-nation 
aspirations, were obliged to a very large extent to build 
their front and to supply and replenish it from non- 
Russian elements who were hostile to these aspirations, 
and that they were obliged to operate in areas which 
were obviously alien to their armies. It was natural 
that armies which had no internal, national, and still 
less class cohesion, and which were surrounded by a hostile 
environment, should cave in at the first powerful blow 
of the Soviet armies. 
In this respect, the rear of the Polish forces differs 
very substantially from that of Kolchak and Denikin‹ 
to the great advantage of Poland. Unlike the rear of 
Kolchak and Denikin, the rear of the Polish forces is

J. V. S T A L I N 336 
homogeneous and nationally united. Hence its unity and 
staunchness. Its predominant sentiment‹a ³sense of 
motherland²‹is communicated through numerous channels 
to the Polish Front, lending the units national 
cohesion and firmness. Hence the staunchness of the 
Polish troops. Poland¹s rear, of course, is not (and cannot 
be!) homogeneous in the class sense; but class conflicts 
have not yet reached such a pitch as to undermine the 
sense of national unity and to breed antagonisms in a 
front of heterogeneous class composition. If the Polish 
forces were operating in Poland¹s own territory, it would 
undoubtedly be difficult to fight against them. 
But Poland is not content with her own territory and 
is pushing her armies forward, subjugating Lithuania 
and Byelorussia, and driving deeply into Russia and 
the Ukraine. This circumstance alters the situation fundamentally, 
to the great detriment of the stability of 
the Polish armies. 
As the Polish armies advance beyond the borders of 
Poland and penetrate deeper into the adjacent regions, 
they get farther and farther away from their national 
rear, weaken their communications with it, and find 
themselves in an alien, and for the most part hostile, 
national environment. Worse still, this hostility is aggravated 
by the fact that the overwhelming majority 
of the inhabitants of the areas adjacent to Poland (Byelorussia, 
Lithuania, Russia, the Ukraine) consist of non- 
Polish peasants who are oppressed by Polish landlords, 
and that these peasants regard the offensive of the Polish 
troops as a war for the power of the Polish gentry, as 
a war against the oppressed non-Polish peasants. This, in 
fact, explains why the slogan of the Soviet army, ³Down

THE ENTENTE¹S NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST RUSSIA 337 
with the Polish gentry!² is meeting with so powerful 
a response among the majority of the inhabitants of 
these regions, why the peasants of these regions welcome 
the Soviet armies as their deliverers from landlord oppression, 
why, in expectation of the arrival of the Soviet 
armies, they rise in revolt at the f i r s t convenient 
opportunity and attack the Polish army in the rear. It 
is to this circumstance, too, that must be attributed 
the unparalleled enthusiasm of the Soviet armies, which 
is attested by all our military and political workers. 
All this cannot but create an atmosphere of uncertainty 
and insecurity within the Polish armies, cannot but 
undermine their morale, their faith in the justice of their 
cause, their faith in victory, and cannot but convert the 
national cohesion of the Polish army from a favourable 
into an unfavourable factor. 
And the further they advance (if they advance at 
all), the more strongly will these unfavourable aspects 
of the Polish campaign make themselves felt. 
Can Poland, under such circumstances, develop a 
strong and powerful offensive, one promising enduring 
successes? 
Will not the Polish troops, under these circumstances, 
find themselves in a situation similar to that in which 
the German troops, cut off from their rear, found themselves 
in the Ukraine in 1918? 
This brings us to the question of the striking area. 
In war in general, and in civil war in particular, success, 
decisive victory, not infrequently depends upon a successful 
choice of the striking area, the area from which you 
intend to deliver and develop your main blow against 
the enemy. One of Denikin¹s big mistakes was that he

J. V. S T A L I N 338 
chose as the area of his main blow the Donets Basin- 
Kharkov-Voronezh-Kursk zone, an area which was patently 
unreliable for him, one that was hostile to him, 
and in which he could create neither a firm rear nor favourable 
conditions for the advance of his troops. The 
successes of the Soviet forces on the Denikin front were 
due, among other things, to the fact that the Soviet command 
took the timely precaution to transfer its main 
blow from the Tsaritsyn area (an unfavourable area) to 
the area of the Donets Basin (a highly favourable area), 
where the Soviet troops were greeted by the inhabitants 
with enthusiasm, and from which it was easiest of all 
to pierce Denikin¹s front, split it in two, and advance 
further, all the way to Rostov. 
This factor, which is not infrequently lost sight of 
by the old military experts, is often of decisive importance 
in civil war. 
It should be observed that in this respect, in respect 
of the area of her main blow, Poland is very badly 
off. The fact is that, for the reasons enumerated above, 
not one of the areas adjacent to Poland can be regarded 
as favourable to the Polish army, either for the delivery 
of the main blow or for the further development of this 
blow. Wherever the Polish forces advance, they will 
encounter the resistance of Ukrainian, Russian or Byelorussian 
peasants who are waiting for the Soviet armies 
to come and deliver them from the Polish landlords. 
The position of the Soviet armies, on the other hand, 
is quite favourable in this respect: for them all areas 
will ³do nicely,² so to speak, for as the Soviet armies advance 
they do not fortify, but overthrow the power of 
the Polish gentry and deliver the peasants from bondage.

THE ENTENTE¹S NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST RUSSIA 339 
III 
PROSPECTS 
So far, Poland is warring against Russia single-handed. 
But it would be naive to think that she is alone. What 
we have in mind is not only the all-round support which 
Poland is undoubtedly getting from the Entente, but also 
those fighting allies of Poland which in part have already 
been found by the Entente (the remnants of Denikin¹s 
army, for example), and partly those which will in all 
likelihood be found for the glory of European ³civilization.² 
It is not by chance that the Polish offensive began 
at the time of the San Remo conference,100 to which Russia¹s 
representatives were not admitted. Nor is it by 
chance that Rumania has dropped the question of peace 
negotiations with Russia. . . . Moreover, it is quite likely 
that the Polish offensive, which at first glance seems 
to be a reckless adventure, is actually part of a broadly 
conceived plan for a combined campaign, which is being 
carried out little by little. 
All the same, it should be said that if the Entente 
reckoned on conquering Russia when it organized this 
third campaign against her, it has miscalculated, for the 
chances of defeating Russia in 1920 are less, far less, 
than they were in 1919. 
We have already discussed Russia¹s chances of victory, 
and have said that they are growing and will 
continue to grow. But this does not mean, of course, that 
victory is already in our pocket. The chances of victory 
we have spoken of can be of real value only if other conditions 
are equal, that is, on condition that we make as

J. V. S T A L I N 340 
great an effort now as we did formerly, during Denikin¹s 
offensive, that our armies are supplied and replenished 
punctually and regularly, that our propagandists redouble 
their efforts to enlighten the Red Army men and the population 
around them, and that we clear our rear of scum 
and fortify it with all our strength and by every means. 
Only if these conditions are fulfilled can victory be 
considered assured.

THE SITUATION 
ON THE SOUTH-WESTERN FRONT 
Ukrainian ROSTA Interview 
The day before yesterday Comrade J. V. Stalin, member of 
the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic, returned 
to Kharkov after having spent about three weeks at the front. It 
was while he was there that the Red forces began and gradually 
developed the offensive operations which opened with the celebrated 
breaching of the Polish Front by the Red cavalry. 
Interviewed by a Ukrainian ROSTA correspondent, Comrade 
Stalin said the following: 
THE BREAK-THROUGH 
When speaking of the operation of Comrade Budyonny¹s 
Cavalry Army on the Polish Front in the early part 
of June, many compare it‹this breach of the enemy¹s 
front‹with Mamontov¹s cavalry raid last year. 
But such an analogy is quite incorrect. 
Mamontov¹s operation was of an episodic, guerilla 
character, so to speak, and was not co-ordinated with 
the general offensive operations of Denikin¹s army. 
The break-through of the Cavalry Army, on the other 
hand, is a link in the general chain of the Red Army¹s 
offensive operations. 
Our cavalry raid began on June 5. On the morning 
of that day the Red cavalry, compressed into a tight

J. V. S T A L I N 342 
fist, struck at the Polish Second Army, breached the 
enemy¹s front, raced through the Berdichev area, and 
on the morning of June 7 occupied Zhitomir. 
The details of the capture of Zhitomir and of the 
trophies captured have already been given in the press, 
and I shall say nothing about them. I shall only mention 
one characteristic thing. The Revolutionary Military 
Council of the Cavalry Army had reported to front 
headquarters: ³The Polish army looks with utter disdain 
on our cavalry. We consider it our duty to show the 
Poles that our cavalry has to be respected.² After the 
break-through, Comrade Budyonny wrote us: ³The Polish 
gentry have learned to respect our cavalry; they are 
on the run, tumbling over one another, and leaving the 
road clear for us.² 
RESULTS OF THE BREAK-THROUGH 
The results of the break-through were: 
The Polish Second Army, through which our Cavalry 
Army passed, was put out of action‹over one thousand 
of its men were taken prisoner and about eight thousand 
cut down. 
I have checked the latter figure from several sources 
and find it close to the truth, all the more that at first 
the Poles stubbornly refused to surrender and our cavalry 
literally had to hack their way through. 
That was the first result. 
Second result: the Polish Third Army (Kiev area) 
was cut off from its rear and was in danger of being 
surrounded, in consequence of which it began a general 
retreat in the Kiev-Korosten direction.

THE SITUATION ON THE SOUTH-WESTERN FRONT 343 
Third result: the Polish Sixth Army (Kamenets- 
Podolsk area), left without support on its left flank and 
fearing to be pressed against the Dniester, began a general 
withdrawal. 
Fourth result: as soon as the break-through was 
effected, we launched an impetuous general offensive 
along the whole front. 
FATE OF THE POLISH THIRD ARMY 
As the fate of the Polish Third Army is still not clear 
to all, I shall dwell on this in greater detail. 
Cut off from its base, and with its communications 
disrupted, the Polish Third Army was faced with the 
danger of being captured to a man. In view of this it 
began to burn its baggage trains, blow up its stores and 
put its guns out of action. 
After its first unsuccessful attempts to retire in good 
order, it was forced to take to flight (wholesale flight). 
One third of its effectives (the Polish Third Army 
had about twenty thousand men in all) were taken prisoner 
or cut down. Another third, if not more, discarded 
their weapons and took to flight, dispersing through 
the marshes and forests. Only the remaining third, and 
even less, succeeded in making their way back to their 
own side through Korosten. It is beyond doubt that if 
the Poles had not succeeded in sending timely aid in 
the shape of fresh units through Shepetovka-Sarny, this 
part of the Polish Third Army would also have fallen 
prisoner or would have dispersed through the forests. 
At any rate, it may be considered that the Polish 
Third Army no longer exists. Such remnants as managed

J. V. S T A L I N 344 
to get back to their own side will need thorough overhauling. 
To give an idea of how badly the Polish Third Army 
was smashed, I must tell you that the entire Zhitomir 
highway was strewn with half-burned baggage trains and 
all kinds of motor vehicles, the latter numbering about 
four thousand, according to the report of our chief of 
communications. We captured 70 guns, not less than 
250 machine guns, and a vast quantity of rifles and 
cartridges, which have not yet been counted. 
Such were our trophies. 
SITUATION AT THE FRONT 
The present situation at the front may be described 
as follows: the Polish Sixth Army is retreating, the Second 
is being withdrawn for re-organization, and the Third 
virtually does not exist and is being replaced by other 
Polish units taken from the Western Front or from 
the far rear. 
The Red Army is advancing along the whole front 
and has crossed the line: Ovruch-Korosten-Zhitomir- 
Berdichev-Kazatin-Kalinovka-Vinnitsa-Zhmerinka. 
CONCLUSIONS 
But it would be a mistake to think that the Poles 
on our front have been disposed of. 
After all, we are contending not only against the 
Poles, but against the whole Entente, which has mobilized 
all the dark forces of Germany, Austria, Hungary 
and Rumania and is providing the Poles with supplies 
of every kind.

THE SITUATION ON THE SOUTH-WESTERN FRONT 345 
Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the Poles 
have reserves, which are already concentrated at Novograd-
Volynsk, and their effect will undoubtedly be felt 
within the next few days. 
It should also be borne in mind that there is as yet 
no mass demoralization in the Polish army. There is no 
doubt that more fighting is still to come, and fierce 
fighting at that. 
Hence I consider the boastfulness and harmful selfconceit 
displayed by some of our comrades as out of 
place: some of them, not content with the successes at 
the front, are calling for a ³march on Warsaw²; others, 
not content with defending our Republic against enemy 
attack, haughtily declare that they could be satisfied only 
with a ³Red Soviet Warsaw.² 
I shall not demonstrate that this boastfulness and 
self-conceit are entirely at variance both with the policy 
of the Soviet Government and with the strength of the 
enemy forces at the front. 
I must declare most categorically that we shall not 
be victorious unless we strain every effort in the rear 
and at the front. Without this, we cannot defeat our 
enemies from the West. 
This is emphasized particularly by the offensive of 
Wrangel¹s troops, which has appeared like a ³bolt from 
the blue² and has assumed menacing proportions. 
THE CRIMEAN FRONT 
There is not the least doubt that Wrangel¹s offensive 
was dictated by the Entente in order to ease the difficult 
position of the Poles. Only a naive politician could

J. V. S T A L I N 346 
believe that Curzon¹s correspondence with Comrade 
Chicherin could have any other purpose than to use talk 
of peace to cover up the preparations Wrangel and the 
Entente were making for an offensive from the Crimea. 
Wrangel was not yet ready, and it was for that reason 
(and that reason alone!) that the ³humane² Curzon 
begged Soviet Russia to have mercy on Wrangel¹s forces 
and spare their lives. 
The Entente evidently calculated that at the moment 
when the Red Army overwhelmed the Poles and began 
to advance, Wrangel would appear in the rear of our 
armies and upset all Soviet Russia¹s plans. 
Undoubtedly, Wrangel¹s offensive has considerably 
eased the position of the Poles, but there is scarcely 
reason to believe that Wrangel will succeed in breaking 
through to the rear of our Western armies. 
At all events, the weight and strength of Wrangel¹s 
offensive will be apparent in the very near future.

TELEGRAM TO V. I. LENIN 
Revishin, a front-line general, who was taken prisoner 
by our forces on the Crimean Front on June 10, has 
stated in my presence: a) Wrangel¹s army is getting its 
clothing, guns, rifles, tanks and sabres chiefly from the 
British, and also from the French; b) Wrangel is being 
aided from the sea by big British ships and small French 
ships; c) Wrangel is getting fuel (liquid) from Batum 
(this means that Baku must not supply fuel to Tiflis, 
which can sell it to Batum); d) General Erdeli, who was 
interned by Georgia and was to be turned over to us, 
was already in the Crimea in May (which means that 
Georgia is playing false and deceiving us). 
General Revishin¹s testimony on British and French 
aid to Wrangel is being stenographed and a copy signed 
by him will be sent you as material for Chicherin.

THE SITUATION ON THE POLISH FRONT 
Pravda Interview 
Comrade Stalin, who recently returned from the South-Western 
Front, in an interview with our correspondent stated the following: 
1. MAY-JUNE 
In the last two months, in May and in June, the 
situation at the front presented entirely different 
pictures. 
May was a month of exceptional successes for the 
Polish army. On their right flank, the Poles were successfully 
advancing beyond the Kiev-Zhmerinka line 
and threatening Odessa. On their left flank, they were 
successfully stopping the offensive operations of our troops 
in the direction of Molodechno-Minsk. In the centre, 
having consolidated themselves in Mozyr and captured 
Rechitsa, they were threatening Gomel. 
June, on the other hand, was a month of swift and 
drastic liquidation of the successes gained by the Polish 
army in May. The Poles¹ advance on the Ukraine was 
already stopped, for they were not only driven out of 
Kiev, but thrown back beyond the Rovno-Proskurov- 
Moghilev line. Their advance on Gomel was also stopped 
since their forces were hurled back beyond Mozyr. As 
regards their left flank‹the most stable, according to the 
Polish press‹it must be said that the powerful drive to

THE SITUATION ON THE POLISH FRONT 349 
wards Molodechno made by our troops in this area in the 
past few days leaves no doubt that here too the Poles 
will be flung back. 
July reveals a picture of a decisive change at the 
front in favour of Russia, and of obvious superiority 
on the side of the Soviet armies. 
2. THE ZHITOMIR BREAK-THROUGH 
The break-through effected by our cavalry in the 
Zhitomir area was undoubtedly the decisive factor in 
the radical change at the front. 
Many compare it with Mamontov¹s break-through 
and raid and find them identical. But this is incorrect. 
Mamontov¹s break-through was of an episodic character 
and was not directly co-ordinated with Denikin¹s offensive 
operations. Comrade Budyonny¹s break-through, 
on the contrary, was an essential link in the continuous 
chain of our offensive operations, its aim being not only 
the disruption of the enemy¹s rear services, but also the 
direct performance of a definite strategic task. 
The break-through began at dawn on June 5. On that 
day our cavalry units, compressed into a tight fist, 
with their baggage trains in the centre, breached the 
enemy¹s positions in the Popelnya-Kazatin area, raced 
through the Berdichev area, and on June 7 occupied 
Zhitomir. The resistance of the Poles was so desperate 
that our cavalry literally had to hack their way through, 
the result being that the Poles left on the field not less 
than eight thousand wounded and killed by shot or sabre, 
according to the reports of the Revolutionary Military 
Council of the Cavalry Army.

J. V. S T A L I N 350 
3. RESULTS OF THE BREAK-THROUGH 
Before the Zhitomir break-through the Poles, unlike 
Denikin, had protected the major points on their front 
by a belt of trenches and barbed-wire entanglements, 
and successfully combined mobile warfare with trench 
warfare. This had seriously hampered our advance. 
The Zhitomir break-through upset the Poles¹ calculations 
and reduced the value of combined warfare to a 
minimum. 
That was the first positive result of the break-through. 
Next, the break-through placed the enemy¹s rear 
services and communications in direct jeopardy, as a 
result of which: 
a) the Polish Third Army (Kiev area), fearing-encirclement, 
began a swift retreat which later turned into 
a wholesale flight; 
b) the Polish Second Army (Berdichev area), which 
sustained the main blow of the Cavalry Army, beat 
a hasty retreat; 
c) the Polish Sixth Army (Zhmerinka area), being 
left without support on its left flank, began a regular 
withdrawal westward; 
d) our armies launched an impetuous offensive along 
the whole front. 
That was the second positive result of the Zhitomir 
break-through. 
Lastly, the break-through knocked the arrogance out of 
the Poles, undermined their faith in their own strength, 
sapped their morale. Before the break-through the Polish 
units had looked upon our troops, and especially 
our cavalry, with utter disdain, had fought desperately

THE SITUATION ON THE POLISH FRONT 351 
and refused to surrender. Only after the break-through 
did the Poles begin to surrender in whole groups and 
desert en masse‹the first symptom of demoralization 
in the Polish ranks. Comrade Budyonny, in fact, 
writes to the Revolutionary Military Council of the 
front: ³The Polish gentry have learned to respect our 
cavalry.² 
4. THE DANGER FROM THE SOUTH 
Our successes on the anti-Polish Front are unquestionable. 
It is equally unquestionable that these successes will 
develop. But it would be unbecoming boastfulness to think 
that the Poles are as good as done with, that all that 
remains for us to do is to ³march on Warsaw.² 
Such boastfulness, which saps the energy of our 
officials and breeds a harmful self-conceit, is out of 
place not only because Poland has reserves which she will 
undoubtedly send to the front, not only because Poland 
is not alone and is backed by the Entente, which supports 
her unreservedly against Russia, but also, and 
chiefly, because there has appeared in the rear of our 
armies a new ally of Poland‹Wrangel, who is threatening 
to destroy from the rear the fruits of our victories 
over the Poles. 
It is no use cherishing the hope that Wrangel will 
not be able to reach agreement with the Poles. He has 
already reached agreement and is working hand in 
glove with them. 
Here is what Shulgin¹s Velikaya Rossiya, the Sevastopol 
newspaper which is the inspiration of the Wrangelites, 
says in one of its June issues:

J. V. S T A L I N 352 
³There is no doubt that we, by our offensive, are supporting 
the Poles, for we are diverting to ourselves part of the Bolshevik 
forces which were designated for use on the Polish Front. 
There i s also no doubt that the operations of the Poles are 
of substantial support to us. It does not matter whether we like 
the Poles or dislike them; we must guide ourselves solely by cold 
political calculation. Today an alliance with the Poles against 
the common enemy is to our advantage; as to tomorrow . . . well, 
we shall see.² 
Obviously, the Wrangel Front is an extension of the 
Polish Front, with the difference, however, that Wrangel 
is operating in the rear of our armies engaged against 
the Poles, that is, in the most dangerous place for us. 
It is therefore ridiculous to talk of a ³march on Warsaw,² 
or in general of the lasting character of our successes 
so long as the Wrangel danger has not been eliminated. 
Yet Wrangel is gaining strength, and there is no evidence 
that we are adopting any special or effective measures 
against the growing danger from the South. 
5. REMEMBER WRANGEL 
As a result of our offensive operations against the 
Poles, our front is assuming the shape of an arc, with 
its concave side facing the West and its ends extending 
forward, the southern end lying in the Rovno area, and 
the northern in the Molodechno area. That is what is 
known as an enveloping position vis-à-vis the Polish 
troops, i.e., a position most dangerous to the latter. 
Undoubtedly, this circumstance is taken into account by 
the Entente, which is trying its utmost to embroil Rumania 
in war with Russia, is feverishly seeking new allies 
for Poland, is doing everything it can to assist Wrangel,

THE SITUATION ON THE POLISH FRONT 353 
and is generally trying to save the Poles. It is quite possible 
that the Entente will succeed in finding new 
allies for Poland. 
There is no reason to doubt that Russia will find 
the strength to repel these new enemies as well. But one 
thing must not be forgotten: so long as Wrangel is intact, 
so long as he is in a position to threaten our rear, our 
fronts will be unsteady and insecure, and our successes 
on the anti-Polish Front cannot be lasting. Only with 
the liquidation of Wrangel shall we be able to consider 
our victory over the Polish gentry secure. Therefore, the 
new slogan which the Party must now inscribe on its 
banners is: ³Remember Wrangel!² ³Death to Wrangel!²

HOW THE RED ARMY IS GREETED 
Statement to Krasnoarmeyets101 
Comrade Stalin, member of the Revolutionary Military 
Council of the Republic, states that he cannot 
refrain from remarking on the quite exceptional cordiality 
with which the Red Army on the Polish Front 
is welcomed by the local population. 
³Such an attitude I have not had occasion to observe 
either in the East or in the South,² Comrade Stalin 
says. 
³Despite the poverty of the peasant masses in the 
West compared with the Volga area and the South, they 
were ready to share their last crust of bread with the 
Red Army men. 
³The very onerous Œcartage¹ duty was performed 
without a murmur. 
³The Red Army men were rendered every aid and 
assistance, and when at the close of May we were forced 
to begin a withdrawal the grief of the population was 
great. 
³The population of the frontal zone had experienced 
all the misery of Polish occupation, and were therefore 
fully aware of what the incursion of the Polish gentry 
held in store for them. 
³There is a whole group of units on our front the medical 
care of which has been entirely taken over by peas

HOW THE RED ARMY IS GREETED 355 
ant men and women, who show the utmost concern and 
solicitude for our wounded Red Army men. 
³As to the mood of the Byelorussian peasants on 
the other side of the front, we are informed that continuous 
revolts are breaking out there, and that guerilla 
detachments are active, disrupting the enemy¹s rear, 
setting fire to stores, and wiping out landlords. 
³It may be safely said that the same thing is occurring 
here as happened to Kolchak in Siberia. 
³With the approach of our forces, everywhere the 
enemy¹s rear begins to blow up from within. 
³What we are now witnessing in Byelorussia is a genuine 
peasant revolution against the Polish landlords.²

TO ALL PARTY ORGANISATIONS 
Draft Letter of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)102 
We have information to the effect that around Wrangel 
have gathered a group of experienced and desperate 
cut-throat generals who will stop at nothing. 
Wrangel¹s soldiers are splendidly enregimented, fight 
desperately and prefer suicide to surrender. 
Technically, Wrangel¹s forces are better equipped 
than ours, the flow of tanks, armoured cars, aircraft, 
cartridges and clothing from the West is continuing to 
this day, despite Britain¹s assertion that it has been 
discontinued. 
The weakness of our forces fighting against Wrangel 
lies in the fact that, firstly, they are diluted with 
prisoners of war, former Denikinites, who not infrequently 
desert to the enemy, and, secondly, they are not receiving 
volunteers or mobilized Communists, either in groups 
or singly, from the centre. 
These forces must be purged of former prisoners of war 
and regularly supplied with large contingents of volunteers 
or mobilized Communists, so as to change their 
whole spirit and enable them to defeat the ferocious 
enemy. 
The Crimea must be restored to Russia at all costs, 
otherwise the Ukraine and the Caucasus will always be 
menaced by Soviet Russia¹s enemies.

TO ALL PARTY ORGANISATIONS 357 
The Central Committee charges you with the duty of 
intensifying mass agitation on the lines of this circular 
letter and of immediately arranging for the regular 
dispatch of Communists to the Crimean Front, even at 
the expense of other fronts.

CREATION OF FIGHTING RESERVES 
OF THE REPUBLIC 
1. MEMORANDUM TO THE POLITICAL 
BUREAU, C.C., R.C.P.(B.) 
The behaviour of France and America in openly supporting 
the Poles and Wrangel, and the behaviour of 
Britain in tacitly sanctioning this support, on the one 
hand, and the successes of the Poles, the expected reinforcement 
of Wrangel¹s army with new forces, and the 
concentration of the Rumanian Eastern Army in the Dorokhoi 
area, on the other, are creating a serious international 
and military situation for the Republic. Measures 
must be taken without delay to provide the Republic 
with fresh bayonets (about 100,000) and fresh 
sabres (about 30,000), and with the corresponding military 
supplies. 
The latest successes of the Poles have disclosed a 
fundamental defect of our armies, namely, the lack of 
effective fighting reserves. We must therefore put as the 
primary point of our current programme for enhancing 
the military might of the Republic the creation of powerful 
reserves capable of being thrown on to the front at 
any moment. 
Accordingly, I propose the adoption of the following 
programme for the creation of fighting reserves of the Republic:

CREATION OF FIGHTING RESERVES OF THE REPUBLIC 359 
1. While continuing the normal replenishment of 
the divisions in the firing line that are fit for action, 
immediate steps should be taken to withdraw to the 
rear depleted and semi-depleted divisions (infantry) 
which have become unfit for action. 
2. On the assumption that about 12-15 infantry 
divisions will be found to be in need of withdrawal, 
they should be concentrated in areas (they must be grain 
areas) from which they could be thrown without particular 
delay on to the Wrangel, Polish or Rumanian 
fronts, depending on circumstances (one third of the 
divisions withdrawn might be concentrated, say, in the 
Olviopol area, another third in the Konotop-Bakhmach 
area, and the remaining third in the Ilovaiskaya-Volnovakha 
area). 
3. These divisions should be replenished and supplied 
with a view to raising their strength to 7,000 or 
8,000 bayonets each, and to having them fully ready 
for action by January 1, 1921. 
4. Immediate steps should be taken to replenish our 
cavalry units on active service, with a view to assigning 
in the next few months (by January) 10,000 sabres 
to the First Cavalry Army, 8,000 to the Second Cavalry 
Army, and 6,000 to Gai¹ s corps. 
5. Immediate steps should be taken to form five 
cavalry brigades of 1,500 sabres each (one brigade consisting 
of Terek Cossacks, another of Caucasian highlanders, 
a third of Ural Cossacks, a fourth of Orenburg 
Cossacks, and a fifth of Siberian Cossacks). Formation 
of the brigades to be completed within two months. 
6. Everything should be done to organize and develop 
an automobile industry, special attention being

J. V. S T A L I N 360 
paid to the repair and manufacture of Austin and Fiat 
vehicles. 
7. Every effort should be made to develop the production 
of armour plate, chiefly with a view to the 
armouring of motor vehicles. 
8. Every effort should be made to develop aircraft 
production. 
9. The supply programme should be enlarged in conformity 
with the above points.

2. STATEMENT TO THE POLITICAL 
BUREAU, C.C., R.C.P.(B.) 
Trotsky¹s reply on the subject of reserves is an evasion. 
His previous telegram, to which he refers in his 
reply, does not even hint at a plan for the creation 
of reserves, at the necessity for such a plan. When the 
divisions are to be withdrawn; to what areas; by what 
date they are to be brought up to strength; the training 
of replenishments and their cementing‹all these 
points (which are by no means details!) are avoided. 
An important (unfavourable) role in the summer campaign 
was played by the remoteness of the reserves from 
the fronts (Urals, Siberia, North Caucasus): the reserves 
arrived late, with great delay, and for the most part failed 
in their purpose. Therefore, the areas of concentration 
of reserves must be well considered in advance as a 
very important factor.

CREATION OF FIGHTING RESERVES OF THE REPUBLIC 361 
An equally important role (also unfavourable) was 
played by the lack of training of the replenishments: 
semi-raw and uncemented, and suitable only in the onsweep 
of a general offensive, the replenishments usually 
failed to withstand serious enemy counteraction, 
abandoned practically all their matériel, and surrendered 
to the enemy by tens of thousands. Therefore, the 
period of training and bringing up to strength, as a very 
important factor, must also be well considered in advance. 
An even more important role (also unfavourable) was 
played by the haphazard, impromptu character of our reserves: 
since we had no special reserve units, reserves 
were not infrequently patched together haphazardly and 
with extreme haste from all sorts of scrappy units, 
including even the VOKR,103 which tended to undermine 
the staunchness of our armies. 
In brief, systematic work must be begun (immediately!) 
to provide the Republic with effective reserves‹
otherwise we risk finding ourselves confronted 
with a new, ³unexpected² (³like a bolt from the blue²) 
military catastrophe. 
Supply is not ³the most important thing,² as Trotsky 
mistakenly thinks. The history of the civil war 
shows that we coped with the problem of supply in 
spite of our poverty, yet half the ³shirts² and ³boots² 
issued to the soldiers found their way into the hands 
of the peasants. Why? Because the soldiers sold them 
(and will go on selling them!) to the peasants in 
exchange for milk, butter, meat, that is, in exchange 
for the things we are unable to give them. And in 
this (summer) campaign, too, we coped with the problem 
of supply, but suffered a reverse nevertheless (as far

J. V. S T A L I N 362 
as I know, no one has yet ventured to accuse our supply 
men of being responsible for our reverses on the Polish 
Front. . . ). Evidently, there are factors more important 
than supply (regarding which, see above). 
We must discard once and for all the harmful 
³doctrine² that the supply of the army must be entrusted 
to civilian departments, and all the rest to the 
Field Staff. The Central Committee must be acquainted 
with and control the entire work of the agencies of the 
war department, not excluding the preparation of fighting 
reserves and field operations, if it does not want 
to find itself confronting another catastrophe. 
For this reason I insist: 
1) That the war department should not evade the 
issue with talk about ³soldiers¹ shirts,² but should work 
out (proceed at once to work out) a concrete plan of 
the creation of fighting reserves of the Republic; 
2) That this plan should be examined by the Central 
Committee (through the Council of Defence); 
3) That the Central Committee should strengthen its 
control of the Field Staff by introducing the practice 
of periodical reports by the Commander-in-Chief or the 
Chief of Field Staff to the Council of Defence or to a 
special commission composed of members of the Council 
of Defence.

THE POLICY 
OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT 
ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
IN RUSSIA 
Three years of revolution and civil war in Russia 
have shown that unless central Russia and her border 
regions support each other the victory of the revolution 
and the liberation of Russia from the clutches 
of imperialism will be impossible. Central Russia, 
that hearth of world revolution, cannot hold out long 
without the assistance of the border regions, which 
abound in raw materials, fuel and foodstuffs. The border 
regions of Russia in their turn would be inevitably 
doomed to imperialist bondage without the political, 
military and organizational support of more developed 
central Russia. If it is true to say that the more 
developed proletarian West cannot finish off the world 
bourgeoisie without the support of the peasant East, 
which is less developed but which abounds in raw materials 
and fuel, it is equally true to say that more developed 
central Russia cannot carry the revolution through 
to the end without the support of the border regions 
of Russia, which are less developed but which abound 
in essential resources. 
The Entente undoubtedly took this circumstance 
into account from the very first days of the existence of 
the Soviet Government, when it (the Entente) pursued

J. V. S T A L I N 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
364 
the plan of the economic encirclement of central Russia 
by cutting off the most important of her border regions. 
And the plan of the economic encirclement of 
Russia has remained the unchanging basis of all the Entente¹s 
campaigns against Russia, from 1918 to 1920, not 
excluding its present machinations in the Ukraine, Azerbaijan 
and Turkestan. 
All the more important is it, therefore, to achieve 
a firm union between the centre and the border regions 
of Russia. 
Hence the need to establish definite relations, definite 
ties between the centre and the border regions 
of Russia ensuring an intimate and undestructible union 
between them. 
What must these relations be, what forms must 
they assume? 
In other words, what is the policy of the Soviet 
Government on the national question in Russia? 
The demand for the secession of the border regions 
from Russia as the form of the relations between the 
centre and the border regions must be rejected not 
only because it runs counter to the very formulation 
of the question of establishing a union between the 
centre and the border regions, but primarily because it 
runs fundamentally counter to the interests of the mass 
of the people in both the centre and the border regions. 
Apart from the fact that the secession of the border 
regions would undermine the revolutionary might of 
central Russia, which is stimulating the movement for 
emancipation in the West and the East, the seceded 
border regions themselves would inevitably fall into 
the bondage of international imperialism. One has only

POLICY OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT ON NATIONAL QUESTION 365 
to glance at Georgia, Armenia, Poland, Finland, etc., 
which have seceded from Russia but which have retained 
only the semblance of independence, having in 
reality been converted into unconditional vassals of 
the Entente; one has only, lastly, to recall the recent 
case of the Ukraine and Azerbaijan, of which the former 
was plundered by German capital and the latter by the 
Entente, to realize the utterly counter-revolutionary 
nature of the demand for the secession of the border 
regions under present international conditions. When 
a life-and-death struggle is developing between proletarian 
Russia and the imperialist Entente, there are 
only two possible outcomes for the border regions: 
Either they go along with Russia, and then the toiling 
masses of the border regions will be freed from 
imperialist oppression; 
Or they go along with the Entente, and then the 
yoke of imperialism will be inevitable. 
There is no third course. 
The so-called independence of so-called independent 
Georgia, Armenia, Poland, Finland, etc., is only an 
illusion, and conceals the utter dependence of these 
apologies for states on one or another group of imperialists. 
Of course, the border regions of Russia, the nations 
and races which inhabit these regions, possess, as 
all other nations do, the inalienable right to secede 
from Russia; and if any of these nations decided by a 
majority to secede from Russia, as was the case with 
Finland in 1917, Russia, presumably, would be obliged 
to take note of the fact and sanction the secession. 
But the question here is not about the rights of nations,

J. V. S T A L I N 366 
which are unquestionable, but about the interests of the 
mass of the people both in the centre and in the border 
regions; it is a question of the character‹which is determined 
by these interests‹of the agitation which our 
Party must carry on if it does not wish to renounce 
its own principles and if it wishes to influence the will 
of the labouring masses of the nationalities in a definite 
direction. And the interests of the masses render 
the demand for the secession of the border regions at 
the present stage of the revolution a profoundly counter-
revolutionary one. 
Similarly, what is known as cultural-national autonomy 
must also be rejected as a form of union between 
the centre and the border regions of Russia. The 
experience of Austria-Hungary (the birthplace of cultural-
national autonomy) during the last ten years has 
revealed the absolutely ephemeral and non-viable character 
of cultural-national autonomy as a form of alliance 
between the labouring masses of the nationalities 
of a multi-national state. Springer and Bauer, the 
authors of cultural-national autonomy, who are now 
confronted by the failure of their cunningly contrived 
national programme, are living corroborations of this. 
Finally, the champion of cultural-national autonomy 
in Russia, the once famous Bund, was itself recently 
obliged officially to acknowledge the superfluousness 
of cultural-national autonomy, publicly declaring 
that: 
³The demand for cultural-national autonomy, which was put 
forward under the capitalist system, loses its meaning in the conditions 
of a socialist revolution² (see The Twelfth Conference of the 
Bund, 1920, p. 21).

POLICY OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT ON NATIONAL QUESTION 367 
There remains regional autonomy for border regions 
that are distinguished by a specific manner of life 
and national composition, as the only expedient form 
of union between the centre and the border regions, 
an autonomy which is designed to connect the 
border regions of Russia with the centre by a federal 
tie. This is the Soviet form of autonomy which 
was proclaimed by the Soviet Government from the 
very first days of its existence and which is now being 
put into effect in the border regions in the form of 
administrative communes and autonomous Soviet republics. 
Soviet autonomy is not a rigid thing fixed once and 
for all time; it permits of the most varied forms and 
degrees of development. It passes from narrow, administrative 
autonomy (the Volga Germans, the Chuvashes, 
the Karelians) to a wider, political autonomy 
(the Bashkirs, the Volga Tatars, the Kirghiz); from 
wide political autonomy to a still wider form of it 
(the Ukraine, Turkestan); and, lastly, from the Ukrainian 
type of autonomy to the highest form of autonomy‹
to contractual relations (Azerbaijan). This flexibility 
of Soviet autonomy is one of its prime merits; 
for this flexibility enables it to embrace all the 
various types of border regions of Russia, which vary 
greatly in their levels of cultural and economic development. 
The three years of Soviet policy on the national 
question in Russia have shown that in applying 
Soviet autonomy in its diverse forms the Soviet Government 
is on the right path, for this policy alone 
has made i t possible for i t to open the road to the 
remotest corners of the border regions of Russia, to

J. V. S T A L I N 368 
arouse to political activity the most backward and nationally 
diverse masses and to connect these masses with 
the centre by the most varied ties‹a problem which 
no other government in the world has solved, or has 
even set itself (being afraid to do so!). The administrative 
redivision of Russia on the basis of Soviet 
autonomy has not yet been completed; the North Caucasians, 
the Kalmyks, the Cheremiss, the Votyaks, the 
Buryats and others are still awaiting a settlement of 
the question. But no matter what aspect the administrative 
map of the future Russia may assume, and no 
matter what shortcomings there may have been in this 
field‹and some shortcomings there certainly were‹it 
must be acknowledged that by undertaking an administrative 
redivision on the basis of regional autonomy 
Russia has made a very big stride towards rallying 
the border regions around the proletarian centre and 
bringing the government into closer contact with the 
broad masses of the border regions. 
But the proclamation of this or that form of Soviet 
autonomy, the issuing of corresponding decrees and 
ordinances, and even the creation of governments in 
the border regions, in the shape of regional Councils 
of People¹s Commissars of the autonomous republics, 
are still far from enough to consolidate the union between 
the border regions and the centre. To consolidate 
this union it is necessary, first of all, to put an 
end to the estrangement and isolation of the border 
regions, to their patriarchal and uncultured manner of 
life, and to their distrust of the centre, which still 
persist in the border regions as a heritage of the 
brutal policy of tsarism. Tsarism deliberately culti

POLICY OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT ON NATIONAL QUESTION 369 
vated patriarchal and feudal oppression in the border 
regions in order to keep the masses in slavery and ignorance. 
Tsarism deliberately settled the best areas 
in the border regions with colonizing elements in order 
to force the masses of the native nationalities into the 
worst areas and to intensify national s t r i f e . Tsarism 
restricted, and at times simply suppressed, the 
native schools, theatres and educational institutions 
in order to keep the masses in ignorance. Tsarism 
frustrated all initiative of the best members of the native 
population. Lastly, tsarism suppressed all activity of 
the masses in the border regions. By all these means 
tsarism implanted among the mass of the native nationalities 
a profound distrust, at times passing into 
direct hostility, towards everything Russian. If the 
union between central Russia and the border regions 
is to be consolidated, this distrust must be removed 
and an atmosphere of mutual understanding and 
fraternal confidence created. But in order to remove 
this distrust we must first help the masses of the border 
regions to emancipate themselves from the survivals 
of feudal-patriarchal oppression; we must abolish‹
actually, and not only nominally‹all the privileges 
of the colonizing elements; we must allow the 
masses to experience the material benefits of the revolution. 
In brief, we must prove to the masses that central, 
proletarian Russia is defending their interests, 
and their interests alone; and this must be proved not 
only by repressive measures against the colonizers 
and bourgeois nationalists, measures that are often 
quite incomprehensible to the masses, but primarily

J. V. S T A L I N 370 
by a consistent and carefully considered economic 
policy. 
Everybody is acquainted with the liberals¹ demand 
for universal compulsory education. The Communists in 
the border regions cannot be more Right-wing than 
the liberals; they must put universal education into 
effect there if they want to end the ignorance of the people 
and if they want to create closer spiritual ties between 
the centre of Russia and the border regions. But 
to do so, it is necessary to develop local national schools, 
national theatres and national educational institutions 
and to raise the cultural level of the masses of the 
border regions, for it need hardly be shown that ignorance 
is the most dangerous enemy of the Soviet regime. 
We do not know what success is attending our work in 
this field generally, but we are informed that in one 
of the most important border regions the local People¹s 
Commissariat of Education is spending on the native 
schools only ten per cent of its credits. If that is true, 
i t must be admitted that in this field we have, unfortunately, 
not gone much further than the ³old 
regime.² 
Soviet power is not power divorced from the people; 
on the contrary, it is the only power of its kind, having 
sprung from the Russian masses and being near and 
dear to them. This in fact explains the unparalleled 
strength and resilience which the Soviet regime usually 
displays at critical moments. 
Soviet power must become just as near and dear 
to the masses of the border regions of Russia. But this 
requires that it should first of all become comprehensible 
to them. It is therefore necessary that all Soviet

POLICY OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT ON NATIONAL QUESTION 371 
organs in the border regions‹the courts, the administration, 
the economic bodies, the organs of direct authority 
(and the organs of the Party as well)‹should 
as far as possible be recruited from the local people 
acquainted with the manner of life, habits, customs and 
language of the native population; that all the best people 
from the local masses should be drawn into these 
institutions; that the local labouring masses should 
participate in every sphere of administration of the 
country, including the formation of military units, in 
order that the masses should see that the Soviet power 
and its organs are the products of their own efforts, 
the embodiment of their aspirations. Only in this way 
can firm spiritual ties be established between the masses 
and the Soviet power, and only in this way can the 
Soviet power become comprehensible and dear to the 
labouring masses of the border regions. 
Some comrades regard the autonomous republics in 
Russia and Soviet autonomy generally as a temporary, 
if necessary, evil which owing to certain circumstances 
had to be tolerated, but which must be combated with 
a view to its eventual abolishment. It need hardly be 
shown that this view is fundamentally false and that 
at any rate it is entirely foreign to the policy of the Soviet 
Government on the national question. Soviet autonomy 
must not be regarded as an abstraction or an artificial 
thing; still less should it be considered an empty and 
declaratory promise. Soviet autonomy is the most real 
and concrete form of the union of the border regions with 
central Russia. Nobody will deny that the Ukraine, 
Azerbaijan, Turkestan, Kirghizia, Bashkiria, Tataria and 
the other border regions, if they desire the cultural and

J. V. S T A L I N 372 
material prosperity of their masses, must have native 
schools, courts, administration and organs of authority, 
recruited principally from the local people. Furthermore, 
the real sovietization of these regions, their conversion 
into Soviet countries closely bound with central Russia 
in one integral state, is inconceivable without the widespread 
organization of local schools, without the creation 
of courts, administrative bodies, organs of authority, 
etc., staffed with people acquainted with the life and 
language of the population. But establishing schools, 
courts, administration and organs of authority functioning 
in the native language‹this is precisely putting 
Soviet autonomy into practice; for Soviet autonomy is 
nothing but the sum total of all these institutions 
clothed in Ukrainian, Turkestan, Kirghiz, etc., forms. 
How, after this, can one seriously say that Soviet 
autonomy is ephemeral, that it must be combated, and 
so on? 
One thing or the other: 
Either the Ukrainian, Azerbaijan, Kirghiz, Uzbek, 
Bashkir and other languages are an actual reality, and 
it is therefore absolutely essential to develop in these 
regions native schools, courts, administrative bodies and 
organs of authority recruited from the local people‹ 
in which case Soviet autonomy must be put into 
effect in these regions in its entirety, without reservations; 
Or the Ukrainian, Azerbaijan and other languages are 
a pure fiction, and therefore schools and other institutions 
functioning in the native languages are unnecessary‹
in which case Soviet autonomy must be discarded 
as useless lumber.

POLICY OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT ON NATIONAL QUESTION 373 
The search for a third way is due either to ignorance 
of the subject or to deplorable folly. 
One serious obstacle to the realization of Soviet 
autonomy is the acute shortage in the border regions 
of intellectual forces of local origin, the shortage of instructors 
in every branch of Soviet and Party work without 
exception. This shortage cannot but hamper both educational 
and revolutionary constructive work in the border 
regions. But for that very reason it would be unwise 
and harmful to alienate the all too few groups of native 
intellectuals, who perhaps would like to serve the masses 
but are unable to do so, perhaps because, not being Communists, 
they believe themselves to be surrounded by an 
atmosphere of mistrust and are afraid of possible repressive 
measures. The policy of drawing such groups into 
Soviet work, the policy of recruiting them for industrial, 
agrarian, food-supply and other posts, with a view to 
their gradual sovietization, may be applied with success. 
For it can hardly be maintained that these intellectual 
groups are less reliable than, let us say, the counterrevolutionary 
military experts who, their counter-revolutionary 
spirit notwithstanding, were drawn into the 
work and subsequently became sovietized, occupying very 
important posts. 
But the employment of the national groups of 
intellectuals will still be far from sufficient to satisfy 
the demand for instructors. We must simultaneously 
develop in the border regions a ramified system of 
courses of study and schools in every branch of administration 
in order to create cadres of instructors from 
the local people. For i t i s clear that without such 
cadres the organization of native schools, courts, ad

J. V. S T A L I N 374 
ministrative and other institutions functioning in 
the native languages will be rendered extremely difficult. 
A no less serious obstacle to the realization of Soviet 
autonomy is the haste, often becoming gross tactlessness, 
displayed by certain comrades in the matter of sovietizing 
the border regions. When such comrades venture to 
take upon themselves the ³heroic task² of introducing 
³pure communism² in regions which are a whole historical 
period behind central Russia, regions where the 
medieval order has not yet been wholly abolished, one 
may safely say that no good will come of such cavalry 
raids, of ³communism² of this kind. We should like to 
remind these comrades of the point in our programme 
which says: 
³The R.C.P. upholds the historical and class standpoint, 
giving consideration to the stage of historical development in 
which the given nation finds itself‹whether it is on the way 
from medievalism to bourgeois democracy, or from bourgeois 
democracy to Soviet, or proletarian, democracy, etc.² 
And further: 
³In any case, the proletariat of those nations which were 
oppressor nations must exercise particular caution and be particularly 
heedful of the survivals of national sentiment among the 
labouring masses of the oppressed or unequal nations² (see Programme 
of the R.C.P.). 
That means that if in Azerbaijan, for instance, the 
direct method of requisitioning superfluous dwelling 
space alienates from us the Azerbaijanian masses, who 
regard the home, the domestic hearth, as sacred and 
inviolable, it is obvious that the direct way of requisi

POLICY OF SOVIET GOVERNMENT ON NATIONAL QUESTION 375 
tioning superfluous dwelling space must be replaced by 
an indirect, roundabout way of achieving the same 
end. Or if, for instance, the Daghestan masses, who are 
profoundly imbued with religious prejudices, follow 
the Communists ³on the basis of the Sharia,² it is obvious 
that the direct way of combating religious prejudices 
in this country must be replaced by indirect and more 
cautious ways. And so on, and so forth. 
In brief, cavalry raids with the object of ³immediately 
communizing² the backward masses must be 
discarded in favour of a circumspect and carefully considered 
policy of gradually drawing these masses into 
the general stream of Soviet development. 
Such in general are the practical conditions necessary 
for realizing Soviet autonomy, the introduction 
of which ensures closer spiritual ties and a firm revolutionary 
union between the centre and the border 
regions of Russia. 
Soviet Russia is performing an experiment without 
parallel hitherto in the world in organizing the cooperation 
of a number of nations and races within a single 
proletarian state on a basis of mutual confidence, 
of voluntary and fraternal agreement. The three years 
of the revolution have shown that this experiment 
has every chance of succeeding. But this experiment 
can be certain of complete success only if our practical 
policy on the national question in the localities 
does not run counter to the demands of already proclaimed 
Soviet autonomy, in its varied forms and 
degrees, and if every practical measure we adopt in 
the localities helps to introduce the masses of the 
border regions to a higher, proletarian spiritual and

J. V. S T A L I N 376 
material culture in forms conforming with the manner 
of life and national features of these masses. 
In that lies the guarantee of the consolidation of the 
revolutionary union between central Russia and the 
border regions of Russia, against which all the machinations 
of the Entente will be shattered.

SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF THE FIRST 
ALL-RUSSIAN CONFERENCE 
OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL 
OF THE WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ 
INSPECTION 
October 15, 1920 
I declare open the first all-Russian conference of 
officials of the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection. 
Comrades, before proceeding to the business of our 
conference, permit me to state the opinion of the People¹s 
Commissariat of Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection on 
the question whether an Inspection is needed in a workers¹ 
and peasants¹ state, and, if it is, what its basic 
tasks should be. 
Russia is so far the only country where the workers 
and peasants have seized power. The pre-condition for 
the seizure of power was the most profound revolution 
in the world, which was followed by the abolition of 
the old machinery of state power and the rise of a 
new one. The position in the old days was that the workers 
as a rule toiled for the masters, while the masters governed 
the country. This, in fact, explains why, before 
the revolution, all the experience in governing the 
country was concentrated in the ruling classes. But 
after the October Revolution, power was assumed by

J. V. S T A L I N 378 
the workers and peasants, who had never governed 
before, who knew only how to work for others, and 
who had no adequate experience in governing the country. 
That was the first circumstance which was the source 
of those shortcomings from which the administrative 
machinery of the Soviet country is now suffering. 
Further, with the abolition of the old apparatus of 
state administration, bureaucracy was smashed, but the 
bureaucrats remained. They disguised themselves as Soviet 
officials and installed themselves in our state apparatus, 
and, taking advantage of the inadequate experience of 
the workers and peasants, who had only just come 
to power, they started their old tricks for pilfering state 
property, introduced the old bourgeois habits and 
customs. 
That was the second circumstance which was the 
basis of shortcomings in our state apparatus. 
Lastly, the new power inherited from the old a completely 
disrupted economic apparatus. The disruption 
was aggravated by the civil war forced upon Russia 
by the Entente. This circumstance was still another of 
the conditions for the existence of defects and shortcomings 
in our government machinery. 
These, comrades, are the basic conditions which have 
given rise to shortcomings in our state apparatus. 
Clearly, so long as these conditions exist, so long as 
shortcomings in our state apparatus continue, we shall 
need an Inspection. 
Of course, the working class is striving to acquire 
experience in governing the country; nevertheless, the 
experience of the representatives of the new class which 
has come to power is still inadequate.

SPEECH AT ALL-RUSSIAN CONFERENCE OF W.P.I 379 
Of course, the disguised bureaucrats who have 
wormed their way into our state apparatus are being 
curbed; but they have not yet been curbed sufficiently. 
Of course, the economic disruption that we are faced 
with is diminishing thanks to the feverish activity of 
our government bodies; nevertheless, the disruption still 
persists. 
And precisely for this reason, so long as these conditions 
continue and these shortcomings exist, we need 
a special state apparatus to study these shortcomings 
and correct them, and to assist our state bodies to become 
more perfect. 
What, then, are the basic tasks of the Inspection? 
There are two basic tasks. 
The first is that the Inspection¹s officials must, as 
the result of, or in the course of, their work of inspection, 
help our comrades in authority both in the centre and 
in the provinces to establish the most efficient forms of 
accountancy of state property, help to establish efficient 
forms of bookkeeping, help to perfect the machinery 
of supply, peacetime and wartime machinery, and the 
economic machinery. 
That is the first basic task. 
The second basic task is that the W.P.I. must in 
the course of its work train from the ranks of the 
workers and peasants instructors who will be capable 
of mastering the entire state apparatus. Comrades, 
a country is not governed by those who elect their 
delegates to parliament, under the bourgeois system, 
or to the Congresses of Soviets, under the Soviet 
system. No, a country is actually governed by those 
who have in fact mastered the executive apparatus of the

J. V. S T A L I N 380 
state and direct it. If the working class really wants to 
master the state apparatus for governing the country, 
it must have experienced agents not only in the centre, 
not only in the places where questions are discussed and 
decided, but also in the places where the decisions are 
put into effect. Only then can it be said that the 
working class has really become master of the state. 
To achieve this, we must have adequate cadres of 
instructors in the work of governing the country. It is 
the basic task of the W.P. I . to rear and train such 
cadres by enlisting the co-operation of the broad strata 
of the workers and peasants in its work. The W.P.I. 
must be a school for such cadres from the ranks of the 
workers and peasants. 
That is the second task of the W.P.I. 
This determines the methods which the Workers¹ and 
Peasants¹ Inspection must practise in its work. In the old, 
pre-revolutionary days, the control was something extraneous 
to the government institutions; it was an external 
force which, when inspecting the institutions, sought to 
catch delinquents, criminals, and that was all. This is 
what I would call the police method, the method of 
catching criminals, of making sensational exposures for 
the press to raise a hue and cry over. This method must 
be discarded. It is not the method of the Workers¹ and 
Peasants¹ Inspection. Our Inspection must not regard the 
institutions they are inspecting as alien bodies; they must 
regard them as their own institutions, which have to be 
taught and perfected. The chief function is not to catch 
individual criminals, but first and foremost to study the 
institutions they are inspecting, to study them thoughtfully 
and seriously, to study their defects and merits,

SPEECH AT ALL-RUSSIAN CONFERENCE OF W.P.I 381 
and to help to perfect them. The worst and most undesirable 
thing would be if our inspectors were to incline 
towards police methods, were to start carping at the 
institution they are inspecting and to snap at its heels, 
i f they were to skim the surface and overlook the 
fundamental shortcomings. 
The W.P.I.¹s method of work should be to disclose 
fundamental shortcomings. I know that this W.P. I . 
policy is very difficult, that it often provokes the displeasure 
of some officials of the inspected institutions. 
I know that often the most honest W.P.I. officials are 
pursued by the hatred of some arrant bureaucrats, as 
well as of some Communists who succumb to the influence 
of such bureaucrats. But that is something the 
Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection should not be afraid 
of. Its fundamental commandment should always be: 
Do not spare individuals, whatever the position they 
occupy; spare only the public cause, only the public 
interest. 
That is a very difficult and delicate task; it demands 
great restraint and great, irreproachable moral purity 
on the part of our officials. I have to say, to my regret, 
that in some of the actual inspections of institutions 
made here in Moscow, the control agents themselves proved 
to be unworthy of their calling. I must declare that towards 
such agents the Commissariat will be implacable. The 
Commissariat will demand that they be punished with 
the utmost severity, because they cast a stain on the 
honour of the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ inspectors. Since 
the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection has been entrusted 
with the lofty duty of correcting the shortcomings 
of our institutions, of helping their personnel to advance

J. V. S T A L I N 382 
and perfect themselves, since it is the duty of the Workers¹ 
and Peasants¹ Inspection to spare no one, but only the 
public interest, then, obviously, the personnel of the 
W.P.I. must themselves be pure, irreproachable and 
implacable in their justice. This is absolutely essential if 
they are to have not only the formal, but also the moral 
right to inspect others and to teach others.

AUTHOR¹S PREFACE 
To a Collection of Articles on the National Question 
Published in 1920 
This pamphlet contains only three articles on the 
national question. The publishers evidently made this 
particular selection because these three articles reflect 
three very important periods in the solution of the national 
question within the ranks of our Party, and, evidently, 
the purpose of the pamphlet as a whole is to give a more 
or less complete picture of the policy of our Party on 
the national question. 
The first article (Marxism and the National Question, 
see the magazine Prosveshcheniye, 1913)104 reflects the 
period of the discussion of the fundamental principles 
of the national question within Russian Social-Democracy 
at the time of the landlord-tsarist reaction, a year 
and a half before the outbreak of the imperialist war, 
at the time when the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
in Russia was gathering momentum. Two theories of 
nations, and, correspondingly, two national programmes 
contended with one another at that time: the Austrian, 
supported by the Bund and the Mensheviks, and the 
Russian, or the Bolshevik. The reader will find a description 
of both trends in the article. Subsequent developments, 
especially the imperialist war and the breakup 
of Austria-Hungary into separate national states,

J. V. S T A L I N 384 
clearly demonstrated which side was right. Now, when 
Springer and Bauer are confronted by the failure of 
their national programme, it is scarcely to be doubted 
that the ³Austrian school² has been condemned 
by history. Even the Bund has had to admit that 
³the demand for cultural-national autonomy (i.e., the 
Austrian national programme‹J. St.), which was put 
forward under the capitalist system, loses its meaning in 
the conditions of a socialist revolution² (see The Twelfth 
Conference of the Bund, 1920). The Bund does not even 
suspect that by this i t has admitted (inadvertently) 
the fundamental unsoundness of the theoretical principles 
of the Austrian national programme, the fundamental 
unsoundness of the Austrian theory of the nation. 
The second article (The October Revolution and the 
National Question, see Zhizn Natsionalnostei, 1918)105 
reflects the period following the October Revolution, 
when the Soviet power, having defeated the counter-
revolution in central Russia, came into conflict 
with the bourgeois-nationalist governments in the border 
regions, which were hotbeds of counter-revolution; 
when the Entente, alarmed by the growing influence 
of the Soviet power on its (the Entente¹s) colonies, 
openly began to support the bourgeois-nationalist governments 
with a view to strangling Soviet Russia; 
when in the course of the victorious struggle against the 
bourgeois-nationalist governments, we were confronted 
with the practical problem of what should be the concrete 
forms of regional Soviet autonomy, of the organization 
of autonomous Soviet republics in the border 
regions, of the extension of the influence of Soviet Russia 
to the oppressed countries of the East through the

AUTHOR¹S PREFACE 385 
eastern border regions of Russia, and of the creation of a 
united revolutionary front of the West and the East against 
world imperialism. The article notes the inseparable 
connection between the national question and the question 
of power, and treats national policy as a part of 
the general question of the oppressed peoples and colonies, 
that is, the very thing against which as a rule the 
³Austrian school,² the Mensheviks, the reformists and 
the Second International objected, and which was later 
confirmed by the whole course of developments. 
The third article (The Policy of the Soviet Government 
on the National Question in Russia, see Zhizn Natsionalnostei, 
October 1920)106 relates to the present period of, 
still incompleted, administrative redivision of Russia 
on the basis of regional Soviet autonomy, the period 
of the organization of administrative communes and 
autonomous Soviet republics in the border regions as 
component parts of the R.S.F.S.R. The central theme 
of the article is the practical implementation of Soviet 
autonomy, that is, the ensuring of a revolutionary 
union between the centre and the border regions as a 
guarantee against imperialist attempts at intervention. 
It may seem strange that the article categorically 
rejects the demand for the secession of the border regions 
from Russia as being a counter-revolutionary move. But 
there is really nothing strange in that. We are for the 
secession of India, Arabia, Egypt, Morocco and other 
colonies from the Entente, because secession in this case 
would mean the liberation of those oppressed countries 
from imperialism, a weakening of the positions of imperialism 
and a strengthening of the positions of the revolution. 
We are against the secession of the border

J. V. S T A L I N 386 
regions from Russia, because secession in that case would 
mean imperialist bondage for the border regions, a weakening 
of the revolutionary might of Russia and a strength 
ening of the positions of imperialism. It is for this 
reason that the Entente, which fights against the secession 
of India, Egypt, Arabia and other colonies, at the same 
time fights for the secession of the border regions from 
Russia. It is for this reason that the Communists, who 
fight for the secession of the colonies from the Entente, 
at the same time cannot but fight against the secession 
of the border regions from Russia. Obviously, secession 
is a question which must be decided in conformity with 
the specific international conditions and in conformity 
with the interests of the revolution. 
Certain passages which are only of historical interest 
might have been deleted from the first article, but 
because of its polemical character it had to be given 
in full and unaltered. The second and third articles are 
likewise reprinted without alteration.

THE POLITICAL SITUATION 
OF THE REPUBLIC 
Report Delivered at a Regional Conference of Communist 
Organisations of the Don and the Caucasus, 
held in Vladikavkaz, 
October 27, 1920 
Comrades, before the October Revolution the conviction 
prevailed in certain West-European socialist 
circles that the socialist revolution might break out and 
be crowned with success first of all in capitalistically 
developed countries. Some conjectured that England 
would be such a country, others, Belgium, and so on. 
But practically all said that the socialist revolution could 
not begin in capitalistically underdeveloped countries, 
where the proletariat was numerically small and poorly 
organized, as, for instance, in Russia. The October 
Revolution has refuted this view, since the socialist 
revolution began precisely in a capitalistically underdeveloped 
country‹Russia. 
Further, some of those who took part in the October 
Revolution were convinced that the socialist revolution 
in Russia could be crowned with success, and that this 
success could be lasting, only if the revolution in Russia 
were directly followed by the outbreak of a more profound 
and serious revolutionary explosion in the West 
which would support the revolution in Russia and impel 
it forward, it being, moreover, taken for granted that such 
an explosion was bound to break out. That view has like

J. V. S T A L I N 388 
wise been refuted by events, since socialist Russia, which 
did not receive direct revolutionary support from the 
Western proletariat and is surrounded by hostile states, 
has successfully continued to exist and develop for 
already three years. 
It has turned out that the socialist revolution can 
not only begin in a capitalistically underdeveloped country, 
but can be crowned with success, make progress 
and serve as an example for the capitalistically developed 
countries. 
Hence, the question of the present situation of Russia 
which is down for discussion at this conference takes 
the following form: Can Russia, left more or less to its 
own devices, and, representing something in the nature 
of a socialist oasis surrounded by hostile capitalist states 
‹can this Russia continue to hold on and to defeat 
and destroy its enemies as it has done hitherto? 
To answer this question, it is first of all necessary to 
elucidate the conditions which guarantee, and which may 
continue in future to guarantee, the existence and progress 
of Soviet Russia. These conditions are of two kinds: 
constant conditions, which are independent of us, and 
variable conditions, which are dependent on human beings. 
In the former category we must class, firstly, the 
fact that Russia is a vast and boundless land, within 
which it is possible to hold on for a long time by retreating, 
in the event of reverses, into the heart of the country 
in order to gather strength for a new offensive. If Russia 
were a small country, such as Hungary, where a powerful 
enemy assault would swiftly decide i t s fate, 
where manoeuvring is difficult and there is nowhere 
to retire to, if Russia were such a small country, it

THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF THE REPUBLIC 389 
could hardly have held on for so long as a socialist 
land. 
Then there is another condition of a constant character 
favouring the development of socialist Russia. It is 
that Russia is one of the few countries in the world which 
abound in every kind of fuel, raw material and food‹ 
that is to say, a country, which is independent of foreign 
lands for fuel, food, etc., a country that can get along in 
this respect without the outside world. It is beyond doubt 
that if Russia had depended for its existence on foreign 
grain and fuel, as Italy, for instance, does, it would 
have found itself in a critical situation on the very 
morrow of the revolution, for it would have been enough to 
blockade it, and it would have been left without grain 
or fuel. Yet the blockade of Russia undertaken by the 
Entente struck at the interests not only of Russia, but of 
the Entente itself, since it deprived the latter of Russian 
raw materials. 
But in addition to constant conditions, there are 
also variable conditions which are just as necessary as 
the former for the existence and development of Soviet 
Russia. What are these conditions? They are those which 
ensure Russia reserves. The point is that in the bitter war 
which has been going on between Russia and the Entente 
for three years, and which may go on for another three 
years‹in such a war the question of fighting reserves is 
decisive. 
What, then, are the Entente¹s reserves? 
What are our reserves? 
The Entente¹s reserves consist, firstly, of Wrangel¹s 
forces and the young armies of the young bourgeois 
states, which have not yet been infected with the ³virus

J. V. S T A L I N 390 
of class antagonisms² (Poland, Rumania, Armenia, 
Georgia, etc.). The Entente¹s weak point in this respect 
is that it has not a counter-revolutionary army of its own. 
Because of the revolutionary movement in the West, 
it is not in a position to hurl against Russia its own, that 
is, British, French and other, forces, and consequently 
has to use the armies of others, which it finances, but 
which it cannot order about entirely at its own discretion 
as if they were its own armies. The fact that these 
armies are operating on the instructions of the Entente 
by no means does away with the frictions that exist, and 
will continue to exist, between the Entente and the 
national interests of the countries whose armies the 
Entente is using. The peace signed with Poland in spite of 
the promptings of the Entente is one more confirmation 
of the existence of such frictions. Well, this fact cannot 
but undermine the inner strength of the Entente¹s fighting 
reserves. 
The Entente¹s reserves consist, secondly, of the 
counter-revolutionary forces that are operating in the 
rear of our armies, organizing guerilla and other actions 
of every kind. 
Lastly, there are also the Entente reserves that are 
operating in the colonies and semi-colonies subjugated by 
the Entente, their object being to stifle the revolutionary 
movement that is beginning to develop in these countries. 
We say nothing of the Entente¹s reserves in Europe 
itself in the shape of all kinds of scorpions, up to and 
including the Second International, whose aim it is to 
stifle the socialist revolution in the West. 
Russia¹s reserves consist, in the first place, of the 
Red Army, which is an army of workers and peasants.

THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF THE REPUBLIC 391 
The Red Army differs from the armies hired and bought 
by the Entente in that i t is fighting for the liberty 
and independence of its own country, that its interests 
merge with the interests of the country for which it is 
shedding its blood, and with the interests of the government 
on whose instructions it is fighting. Therein lies 
the inexhaustible inherent strength of Soviet Russia¹s 
basic reserves. 
Russia¹s reserves consist, secondly, in those revolutionary 
movements which are developing in the West and 
evolving into a socialist revolution. There is no doubt 
that had it not been for this revolutionary movement in 
the West, the Entente would have had its own counterrevolutionary 
armies and would have ventured the risk 
of direct armed intervention in Russia¹s affairs. 
Russia¹s reserves consist, lastly, in that growing 
ferment in the East and in the Entente¹s colonies and 
semi-colonies which is developing into an open revolutionary 
movement for the emancipation of the countries 
of the East from the imperialist yoke, thereby threatening 
to deprive the Entente of its sources of raw materials 
and fuel. It should be remembered that the colonies 
are the Achilles¹ heel of imperialism, a blow at which 
would place the Entente in a critical position. There is 
no doubt that the revolutionary movement in the East is 
surrounding the Entente with an atmosphere of uncertainty 
and disintegration. 
Such are our reserves. 
What has been the historical development of these 
factors? 
In 1918, Soviet Russia consisted of inner Russia, 
which was cut off from its sources of raw materials, food

J. V. S T A L I N 392 
and fuel (the Ukraine, the Caucasus, Siberia, Turkestan), 
had no army to speak of, and received no support 
from the West-European proletariat. At that time the 
Entente could talk of undertaking direct armed intervention 
in Russia¹s affairs, which it did. Now, two 
years later, Russia presents an entirely different picture. 
Siberia, the Ukraine, the Caucasus and Turkestan 
are already liberated. Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin 
have been smashed. Some of the young bourgeois states 
(Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) have been 
neutralized. The remnants of Denikin¹s army (Wrangel¹s 
army) are on the eve of destruction. The revolutionary 
movement in the countries of the West is forging ahead and 
strengthening its militant organ, the Third International, 
while the Entente no longer dares even to think 
of direct armed intervention in Russia¹s affairs. In the 
East, the revolutionary movement against the Entente 
is growing and creating a core in the shape of revolutionary 
Turkey, and forming its militant organ in the shape 
of the Committee of Action and Propaganda.107 
In brief, the Entente¹s reserves are melting away 
day by day, while Soviet Russia¹s reserves are being 
replenished. 
It is clear that now, in 1920, the chances of Russia 
being defeated are incomparably less than they were 
two years ago. It is clear that if Russia withstood the 
Entente¹s assault two years ago, so much the more will 
she withstand it now, when her reserves in all fields of 
the struggle are multiplying. 
Does this mean that the war with the Entente is 
coming to an end, that we may lay down our arms, disband 
our troops and begin peaceful labours?

THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF THE REPUBLIC 393 
No, it does not. The Entente may have reconciled 
itself, however grudgingly, to the peace we have concluded 
with the Poles, but, judging by all the signs, it 
does not intend to lay down its arms; it obviously intends 
to shift the theatre of hostilities to the South, 
to the Transcaucasian area, and it is quite possible 
that Georgia, being a kept woman of the Entente, will 
consider itself in duty bound to serve it. 
Evidently, the belief is that the earth is too small 
for both the Entente and Russia, that one of them must 
perish if peace is to be established on earth. If that is 
how the question stands, if that is the way the Entente 
puts it‹and it is the only way it does put it‹obviously 
Russia cannot lay down its arms. On the contrary, we 
must bend every effort to set into motion all the forces of 
the country to parry the new blow. The Red Army, the 
protector of the liberty and independence of our country, 
must be strengthened and fortified, the socialist revolution 
in the West must be given every support, the 
countries of the East which are fighting the Entente 
for their liberation must be assisted with every means 
in our power‹such are our immediate duties, and we 
must perform them unswervingly and with the utmost 
energy if we want to win. 
And we certainly shall win if we perform these 
duties conscientiously. 
In conclusion, I should like to mention one condition 
without which the victory of the revolution in the West 
will be extremely difficult. I am referring to the building 
up of food stocks for the revolution in the West. 
The fact of the matter is that the Western countries 
(Germany, Italy, etc.) are completely dependent Up

J. V. S T A L I N 394 
America, which supplies Europe with grain. In the event 
of a victory of the revolution in these countries, the 
proletariat would be confronted with a food crisis the 
very next day, should bourgeois America refuse to supply 
them with grain, which is quite likely. Russia has no 
food reserves to speak of, but it could nevertheless accumulate 
a certain stock; and in view of the possibility and 
likelihood of the food prospects just described, it would 
be well to give consideration at once to the question 
of creating a food reserve in Russia for our Western comrades. 
This question is not getting the attention it deserves 
from some of our comrades, but, as you see, it may 
be of vital importance to the course and outcome of the 
revolution in the West.

THREE YEARS 
OF PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP 
Report Delivered at a Celebration 
Meeting of the Baku Soviet 
November 6, 1920 
Comrades, before beginning my report, I want to convey 
the greetings of the All-Russian Central Executive 
Committee of the Soviets of Russia to you, the Soviet 
of Workers¹ Deputies of Baku, the greetings of the Council 
of People¹s Commissars to the Revolutionary Committee 
of Azerbaijan and its head, Comrade Narimanov, 
and the ardent greetings of the Revolutionary Military 
Council of the Republic to the Eleventh Red Army, 
which liberated Azerbaijan and is staunchly upholding 
its liberty. (Applause.) 
The basic question in the affairs of Russia during 
the three years of Soviet power has undoubtedly been 
the question of her international position. There was 
a time when Soviet Russia was ignored, disregarded, 
unrecognized. That was the first period‹from the establishment 
of Soviet power in Russia to the defeat of 
German imperialism. That was the period when the 
Western imperialists‹the two coalitions, the British and 
the German, being at each other¹s throats‹disregarded 
Soviet Russia, had no time for her, so to speak. 
The second period was that from the defeat of German 
imperialism and the beginning of the German revolution

J. V. S T A L I N 396 
down to Denikin¹s broad offensive against Russia, 
when he was at the gates of Tula. The distinguishing 
feature of Russia¹s international position in that period 
was that the Entente‹the Anglo-French-American 
coalition‹having defeated Germany, directed all its 
available forces against Soviet Russia. That was the 
period when we were threatened with an alliance of 
fourteen states, which afterwards proved to be a myth. 
The third period is the one we are in now, when we 
are not only noticed as a socialist power, not only 
recognized in fact, but also feared. 
THE FIRST PERIOD 
Three years ago, on October 25 (or November 7, 
New Style), 1917, a handful of Bolshevik members of 
the Petrograd Soviet met and decided to surround Kerensky¹s 
palace, take prisoner his already demoralized 
troops, and transfer power to the Second Congress of 
Soviets of Workers¹, Peasants¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies, 
which was then assembled. 
At that time many looked upon us as cranks at the 
best, and as ³agents of German imperialism² at the 
worst. 
Internationally, this period could be called the period 
of the complete isolation of Soviet Russia. 
Not only were the surrounding bourgeois states hostile 
to Russia; even our socialist ³comrades² in the West 
looked upon us with distrust. 
If Soviet Russia nevertheless survived as a state, 
it was only because the Western imperialists were then 
absorbed in a fierce struggle among themselves. Further

THREE YEARS OF PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP 397 
more, they looked upon the Bolshevik experiment in 
Russia with scorn: they believed that the Bolsheviks 
would die a natural death. 
Internally, this period may be described as the period 
of the destruction of the old order in Russia, of the destruction 
of the entire apparatus of the old bourgeois power. 
We knew from theory that the proletariat cannot 
simply take over the old state machine and set i t 
going. That theoretical precept, taught us by Marx, was 
fully confirmed in practice when we found ourselves in 
a regular phase of sabotage on the part of the tsarist 
officials, office employees and a certain section of the 
upper proletariat‹a phase of complete disorganization 
of state power. 
The first and most important apparatus of the bourgeois 
state, the old army and its generals, was thrown 
on to the scrap heap. That cost us very dear. It left us 
for a time without any army at all, and we had to sign 
the Brest peace. But there was no alternative; history 
offered us no other way of emancipating the proletariat. 
Another and equally important apparatus of the bourgeoisie 
which was destroyed, thrown on to the scrap heap, 
was the bureaucracy, the apparatus of bourgeois administration. 
In the sphere of economic administration of the country, 
the most notable thing was that the banks, the main 
nerve of the bourgeois economic organism, were taken 
out of the hands of the bourgeoisie. The banks were 
taken out of the hands of the bourgeoisie, and the 
latter was, so to speak, deprived of its soul. Then came 
the work of breaking up the old economic machinery 
and expropriating the bourgeoisie‹depriving it of the

J. V. S T A L I N 398 
mills and factories and turning them over to the working 
class. Lastly came the break-up of the old machinery 
of food supply and the attempt to build a new one 
capable of procuring food and distributing it among 
the population. Finally, there was the abolition of the 
Constituent Assembly. These, roughly, were the measures 
Soviet Russia had to take in this period in order to 
destroy the bourgeois state apparatus. 
THE SECOND PERIOD 
The second period began when the Anglo-French- 
American coalition, having defeated German imperialism, 
set to work to destroy Soviet Russia. 
Internationally, this period can be described as a 
period of open war between the forces of the Entente and 
the forces of Soviet Russia. If in the first period we were 
disregarded, were sneered at and scoffed at, in this period, 
on the contrary, all the dark forces stirred into action in 
order to put an end to the so-called ³anarchy² in Russia, 
which was threatening the decomposition of the entire 
capitalist world. 
Internally, this period must be described as a period 
of construction, when the destruction of the old apparatus 
of the bourgeois state was in the main completed and a 
new phase, a phase of construction had begun; when the 
mills and factories which had been taken away from the 
owners were set going; when real workers¹ control was instituted 
and the proletariat then passed from control to 
direct management, and when a new machinery of food 
supply was being built in place of the one which had 
been destroyed, a new machinery of railway administra

tion in the centre and in the provinces in place of the 
destroyed one, and a new army in place of the old army. 
It must be confessed that in general the work of construction 
proceeded very haltingly in this period, because 
the greater part‹nine-tenths‹of our creative energy was 
devoted to the building of the Red Army, since in the mortal 
struggle against the forces of the Entente the very 
existence of Soviet Russia was at stake, and in that 
period its existence could be preserved only by a powerful 
Red Army. And it must be said that our efforts were 
not in vain, because already in that period the Red 
Army demonstrated the full scope of its might by vanquishing 
Yudenich and Kolchak. 
As regards the international position of Russia, 
this second period may be said to have been one of the 
gradual elimination of Russia¹s isolation. Her first allies 
began to appear. The German revolution produced 
closely-welded cadres of workers, communist cadres, and 
laid the foundation of a new Communist Party in the 
shape of the Liebknecht group. 
In France, a small group which nobody had paid 
any attention to before, the Loriot group, became an 
important group of the communist movement. In Italy, 
the communist trend, which had been weak at first, 
came to embrace practically the whole Italian Socialist 
Party, its majority. 
In the East, the Red Army¹s successes started a 
ferment which, for instance in Turkey, developed into 
an outright war against the Entente and its allies. 
The bourgeois states themselves in this period were 
no longer the solid body of hostility to Russia which they 
had been in the first period, to say nothing of the dis- 
THREE YEARS OF PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP

J. V. S T A L I N 400 
agreements within the Entente itself over the question 
of recognizing Soviet Russia, which grew more acute 
as time went on. Voices began to be raised advocating 
negotiation and agreement with Russia. Estonia, Latvia 
and Finland were examples. 
Lastly, ³Hands off Russia!² had become a popular 
slogan among the British and French workers and made 
it impossible for the Entente to intervene directly in 
Russia¹s affairs by force of arms. The Entente had to stop 
sending British and French soldiers against Russia. It 
had to confine itself to using the armies of others against 
Russia, armies which it could not order about at its own 
discretion. 
THE THIRD PERIOD 
The third period is the one we are in now. It may 
be called a transition period. The distinguishing feature 
of the first part of this period was that, having defeated 
the main enemy, Denikin, and foreseeing the end of the 
war, Russia set about converting the state apparatus, 
which had been adapted to the purposes of war, to new 
tasks, the tasks of economic construction. Whereas, 
formerly, the cry had been: ³Everything for the war!² 
³Everything for the Red Army!² ³Everything for victory 
over the foreign enemy!²‹now it became: ³Everything 
for the strengthening of the economy!² However, this 
phase of the third period, which began after the defeat 
of Denikin and his ejection from the Ukraine, was 
interrupted by Poland¹s attack on Russia. The Entente¹s 
purpose in this was to prevent Soviet Russia from getting 
on its feet economically and becoming a great

THREE YEARS OF PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP 401 
world power. The Entente feared this, and incited Poland 
against Russia. 
The state apparatus, already adapted for economic 
construction, had to be reconstructed again; the Labour 
Armies which had been formed in the Ukraine, the 
Urals and the Don area had again to be put on a war 
footing in order to rally the fighting units around them 
and dispatch them against Poland. This period is ending 
with Poland already neutralized and no new external 
enemies are so far in sight. The only direct enemy is 
the remnants of Denikin¹s army, represented by Wrangel, 
who is now being smashed by our Comrade Budyonny. 
Now there are grounds for assuming that, for a short 
period at least, Soviet Russia will receive a valuable 
respite in which to direct all the energies of its indefatigable 
forces, who brought the Red Army into being 
almost in one day, to the work of economic construction, 
and to put our factories, our agriculture and our food 
agencies on their feet. 
Externally, internationally, the distinguishing feature 
of the third period is not only that our enemies have 
ceased to ignore Russia, nor only that they have begun 
to fight her‹even brandishing the bogey of the mythical 
fourteen states with which Churchill threatened Russia‹
but that, having received a series of drubbings, 
they have even begun to fear Russia, realizing that she 
is growing into a great socialist people¹s power, which 
will not allow itself to be ill-used. 
Internally, the distinguishing feature of this period 
is that, with the defeat of Wrangel, Russia is getting 
her hands free and is devoting all her energies to 
internal affairs. Indeed, it is already observable

J. V. S T A L I N 402 
that our economic bodies are working much better, 
much more thoroughly, than they did in the second 
period. In the summer of 1918 the workers of Moscow 
received one-eighth of a pound of bread mixed with oilcake 
once in two days. That difficult and distressful 
period is now a thing of the past. The workers of Moscow, 
as well as of Petrograd, now receive a pound and a half 
of bread a day. That means that our food agencies have 
got properly going, have improved, have learned how 
to procure grain. 
As to our policy towards internal enemies, it remains, 
and must remain, what it was in all the three 
periods, that is, a policy of crushing all the enemies of the 
proletariat. This policy cannot of course be called a policy 
of ³universal freedom²‹in the era of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat there can be no universal freedom, 
that is, no freedom of speech, freedom of the press, etc., for 
our bourgeoisie. The sum and substance of our home policy 
is to grant maximum freedom to the proletarian sections 
of town and country, and to deny even minimum freedom 
to the remnants of the bourgeois class. 
That is the essence of our policy, which rests upon 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
PROSPECTS 
Of course, our constructive work in these three years 
has not been as effective as we would have liked. But 
allowances must be made for the difficult, the impossible 
conditions in which the work had to be done, 
conditions which could not be evaded and could not be 
gainsaid, but which had to be overcome.

THREE YEARS OF PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP 403 
Firstly, we had to build under fire. Imagine a mason 
who has to lay bricks with one hand and defend what 
he is building with the other. 
Secondly, what we were building was not a bourgeois 
economy in which each pursues his own private 
interest and has no concern for the country as a whole 
and does not set himself the problem of the planned 
organization of the economy on a country-wide scale. No, 
it was a socialist society we were building. That means 
that we must take into account the requirements of society 
as a whole, that the economy of the whole of 
Russia must be organized in a planned and conscious 
way. That is undoubtedly a task of incomparably greater 
complexity and difficulty. 
That is why our constructive efforts could not yield 
the maximum results. 
That being the state of affairs, our prospects are clear: 
we are on the threshold of the liquidation of our external 
enemies, on the threshold of the conversion of our entire 
state machinery from war purposes to economic purposes. 
Our foreign policy is one of peace; we are no believers 
in war. But if war is forced upon us‹and there are signs 
that the Entente is trying to transfer the theatre 
of hostilities to the South, to Transcaucasia‹if the 
Entente, which we have given a beating several times, 
forces war upon us again, then it goes without saying 
that we shall not allow the sword to slip from our hand, 
we shall not disband our armies. We shall continue as 
before to bend every effort to ensure that the Red Army 
flourishes and is ready for action, so that it may be 
able to defend Soviet Russia against its enemies as 
boldly and bravely as it has done until now.

J. V. S T A L I N 404 
Reviewing the past of the Soviet power, I cannot 
help recalling that evening three years ago, on October 
25, 1917, when we, a small group of Bolsheviks headed 
by Comrade Lenin, who had at our disposal the Petrograd 
Soviet (it was then already Bolshevik), a 
small Red Guard, and a quite small and still not fully 
cemented Communist Party of 200,000-250,000 members‹
when we, this small group, deposed the representatives 
of the bourgeoisie and transferred power to the 
Second Congress of Soviets of Workers¹, Peasants¹ and 
Soldiers¹ Deputies. 
Since then three years have elapsed. 
And now we see that in this period Russia has 
steeled herself in the crucible of fire and storm and has 
become a great socialist world power. 
Whereas at that time we had only the Petrograd Soviet, 
now, three years later, all the Soviets of Russia 
are rallied around us. 
Instead of the Constituent Assembly, for which our 
adversaries were then preparing, we now have the All- 
Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets, which 
sprang from the Petrograd Soviet. 
Whereas at that time we had a small guard composed 
of Petrograd workers, who were able to cope with the 
military cadets who had raised revolt in Petrograd, but 
were unable to fight an external enemy because they 
were too weak, now we have a glorious Red Army many 
million strong, which is smashing the enemies of Soviet 
Russia, which has vanquished Kolchak and Denikin, and 
which is now, by the hand of the tried and tested leader 
of our cavalry, Comrade Budyonny, destroying the last 
remnants of Wrangel¹s army.

THREE YEARS OF PROLETARIAN DICTATORSHIP 405 
Whereas at that time, three years ago, we had a 
small and still not fully cemented Communist Party of 
some 200,000-250,000 members in all, now, three years 
later, after the fire and storms through which Soviet 
Russia has passed, we have a party of 700,000, a party 
forged out of steel; a party whose members can be re-marshalled 
at any moment and concentrated by hundreds 
of thousands on any party task; a party which, without 
fear of confusion in its ranks, is able at a wave of the 
hand of the Central Committee to re-form its ranks and 
march against the enemy. 
Whereas at that time, three years ago, we had only 
small groups of sympathizers in the West‹the groups of 
Loriot in France, of MacLean in Britain, of Liebknecht, 
who was murdered by the capitalist scoundrels, in Germany‹
now, three years later, a grand organization of 
the international revolutionary movement has sprung 
up‹the Third, Communist International, which has 
won the adherence of the major European parties: the 
German, the French, the Italian. In the Communist 
International, which has shattered the Second International, 
we now have the main core of the international 
socialist movement. 
And it is not by chance that the leader of the Second 
International, Herr Kautsky, has been thrown out of 
Germany by the revolution, and that he has been forced 
to seek asylum in backward Tiflis, with the Georgian 
social-innkeepers.108 
Lastly, whereas three years ago we observed in the 
countries of the oppressed East nothing but indifference 
to the revolution, now the East has begun to stir, and 
we are witnessing a whole number of liberation move

J. V. S T A L I N 406 
ments there directed against the Entente, against imperialism. 
We have a revolutionary nucleus, a rallying 
centre for all the other colonies and semi-colonies, in the 
shape of the Kemal Government, a bourgeois revolutionary 
government but one which is waging an armed 
struggle against the Entente. 
Whereas three years ago we did not even dare to 
dream that the East might stir into action, now we not 
only have a revolutionary nucleus in the East, in the 
shape of bourgeois revolutionary Turkey; we also possess 
a socialist organ of the East‹the Committee of Action 
and Propaganda. 
All these facts indicating how poor we were in the 
revolutionary sense three years ago and how rich we have 
become now; all these facts furnish us with grounds for 
affirming that Soviet Russia will live, that it will develop 
and defeat its enemies. 
Undoubtedly, our path is not of the easiest; but, 
just as undoubtedly, we are not to be frightened by difficulties. 
Paraphrasing the well-known words of Luther,109 
Russia might say: 
³Here I stand on the border line between the old, 
capitalist world and the new, socialist world. Here, on 
this border line, I unite the efforts of the proletarians 
of the West and of the peasants of the East in order to 
shatter the old world. May the god of history be my aid!²

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES 
OF DAGHESTAN110 
November 13, 1920 
1. DECLARATION ON SOVIET AUTONOMY 
FOR DAGHESTAN 
Comrades, up to very recently the Soviet Government 
of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic was 
preoccupied with war against external enemies both in 
the South and the West, against Poland and Wrangel, 
and had neither time nor opportunity to devote its 
energies to the problem which is agitating the Daghestan 
people. 
Now that Wrangel¹s army has been smashed and its 
miserable remnants are fleeing to the Crimea, and now 
that peace has been concluded with Poland, the Soviet 
Government is in a position to take up the question of 
autonomy for the Daghestan people. 
In Russia, in the past, power was in the hands of 
the tsars, the landlords, the factory owners and mill 
owners. The Russia of the past was a Russia of tsars and 
executioners. Russia lived by oppressing the peoples of 
the old Russian Empire. The Russian Government lived 
on the sap and strength of the peoples it oppressed, 
the Russian people among them.

J. V. S T A L I N 408 
That was a time when Russia was cursed by all 
the peoples. That time is now a thing of the past. It is 
dead and buried, and will never be resurrected. 
From the ashes of this tyrannical Russia of the tsars, 
a new Russia has arisen‹a Russia of the workers and 
peasants. 
A new life has begun for the peoples of Russia. A period 
of emancipation has come for these peoples who 
suffered under the yoke of the tsars and the plutocrats, 
the landlords and factory owners. 
The new period ushered in by the October Revolution, 
when power passed into the hands of the workers 
and peasants, and became communist power, is not 
only marked by the liberation of the peoples of Russia. 
It has raised the question of the liberation of all 
peoples in general, including the peoples of the East 
who are suffering from the oppression of the Western 
imperialists. 
Russia has become a lever of the liberation movement, 
setting in motion the peoples not only of our 
country, but of the whole world. 
Soviet Russia is a torch which lights the path to 
liberation from the yoke of the oppressors for all the 
peoples of the world. 
Now that it is able, thanks to the victory over its enemies, 
to occupy itself with problems of internal development, 
the Government of Russia considers it necessary 
to tell you that Daghestan must be autonomous, that it 
will enjoy the right of internal self-administration, while 
retaining its fraternal tie with the peoples of Russia. 
Daghestan must be governed in accordance with its 
specific features, its manner of life and customs.

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF DAGHESTAN 409 
We are told that among the Daghestan peoples the 
Sharia is of great importance. We have also been informed 
that the enemies of Soviet power are spreading 
rumours that it has banned the Sharia. 
I have been authorized by the Government of the 
Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic to state 
here that these rumours are false. The Government of 
Russia gives every people the full right to govern itself 
on the basis of its laws and customs. 
The Soviet Government considers that the Sharia, 
as common law, is as fully authorized as that of any 
other of the peoples inhabiting Russia. 
If the Daghestan people desire to preserve their laws 
and customs, they should be preserved. 
At the same time, I consider it necessary to state that 
autonomy for Daghestan does not, and cannot, imply its 
secession from Soviet Russia. Autonomy does not mean 
independence. The bond between Russia and Daghestan 
must be preserved, for only then can Daghestan preserve 
its freedom. It is the definite purpose of the Soviet 
Government in granting Daghestan autonomy to single 
out from the local forces men who are honest and 
loyal and who love their people, and to entrust to them 
all the organs of administration in Daghestan, both 
economic and administrative. Only thus, only in this way, 
can close contact be established between Soviet power 
in Daghestan and the people. The Soviet Government has 
no other object than to raise Daghestan to a higher 
cultural level by enlisting the co-operation of local forces. 
The Soviet Government knows that the worst enemy 
of the people is ignorance. It is therefore necessary 
to create the greatest possible number of schools

J. V. S T A L I N 410 
and organs of administration functioning in the local 
languages. 
The Soviet Government hopes in this way to extricate 
the peoples of Daghestan from the quagmire of 
ignorance into which they were plunged by the old 
Russia. 
The Soviet Government considers it essential that the 
same autonomy as is now enjoyed by Turkestan and the 
Kirghiz and Tatar republics should be established in 
Daghestan. 
The Soviet Government recommends that you, the 
representatives of the peoples of Daghestan, should 
instruct your Daghestan Revolutionary Committee to 
select representatives to be sent to Moscow to work out 
there, together with representatives of the highest Soviet 
authority, a plan of autonomy for Daghestan. 
Recent events in southern Daghestan, where the 
traitor Gotsinsky is trying to suppress the liberty of 
Daghestan, acting as an agent of General Wrangel, that 
same Wrangel who, under Denikin, fought the insurrectionary 
highlanders of the Northern Caucasus and destroyed 
their villages‹these events are eloquent. 
I must point out that the people of Daghestan, as represented 
by their Red partisans, have demonstrated their 
loyalty to the Red flag in fighting against Gotsinsky in 
defence of their Soviet power. 
If you drive out Gotsinsky, the enemy of the labouring 
people of Daghestan, you will be justifying the confidence 
placed in you by the highest Soviet authority in 
granting autonomy to Daghestan. 
The Soviet Government is the first government to 
grant Daghestan autonomy voluntarily.

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF DAGHESTAN 411 
We hope that the peoples of Daghestan will justify 
the confidence of the Soviet Government. 
Long Live the Union of the Peoples of Daghestan 
With the Peoples of Russia! 
Long Live the Soviet Autonomy of Daghestan! 
2. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Comrades, bearing in mind that the last enemy of 
Soviet power has been routed, the political significance 
of the autonomy the Soviet Government is voluntarily 
granting Daghestan becomes obvious. 
There is one fact to which attention should be directed. 
Whereas the tsarist government, and the bourgeois governments 
of the world in general, usually make concessions to 
the people and grant one or another reform only when 
they are forced to do so by stress of circumstances, the Soviet 
Government, on the contrary, is granting autonomy 
to Daghestan absolutely voluntarily, and when it is at 
the height of its success. 
This means that the autonomy of Daghestan will 
become the secure and indestructible foundation of the 
life of the Daghestan Republic. For only that is secure 
which is granted voluntarily. 
I should like in conclusion to stress the hope that 
in the future struggle against our common enemies the 
Daghestan peoples will justify the high confidence reposed 
in them by the Soviet Government. 
Long Live Autonomous Soviet Daghestan!

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES 
OF THE TEREK REGION111 
November 17, 1920 
1. REPORT ON SOVIET AUTONOMY 
FOR THE TEREK REGION 
Comrades, this congress has been called in order to 
make known the will of the Soviet Government concerning 
the arrangement of the affairs of the Terek peoples 
and their relations with the Cossacks. 
The first question is the attitude towards the Cossacks. 
Experience has shown that endless trouble arises 
from the fact that Cossacks and highlanders are living 
together in one administrative unit. 
Experience has shown that if mutual offence and 
bloodshed are to be avoided, the mass of the Cossacks 
must be separated from the mass of the highlanders. 
Experience has shown that it would be to the advantage 
of both parties if they separated. 
Accordingly, the Government has decided to separate 
the majority of the Cossacks into a special gubernia, 
and the bulk of the highlanders into an autonomous 
Highland Soviet Republic, with the River Terek 
as the boundary between them. 
It has been the aim of the Soviet Government not 
to injure the interests of the Cossacks. It had no thought, 
comrade Cossacks, of taking your land away from you.

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF THE TEREK REGION 413 
It had only one thought, and that was to deliver you 
from the yoke of the tsarist generals and plutocrats. 
That is the policy it has pursued from the first days 
of the revolution. 
But the behaviour of the Cossacks has been dubious, 
to say the least. They looked askance at the Soviet 
Government and did not trust it. At one time they got 
mixed up with Bicherakhov, later they hobnobbed with 
Denikin, and then with Wrangel. 
And recently, when peace had not yet been concluded 
with Poland and when Wrangel was advancing 
on the Donets Basin, at that moment a section of the 
Terek Cossacks treacherously‹there is no other word 
for it‹rose up against our armies in the rear. 
I am referring to the recent revolt on the Sunzha 
line, the purpose of which was to cut off Baku from 
Moscow. 
The Cossacks temporarily succeeded in this attempt. 
At that moment the highlanders, to the shame of 
the Cossacks be it said, proved themselves worthier 
citizens of Russia. 
The Soviet Government has been very patient, but 
patience has its limit. And so, because of the treachery 
of certain groups of Cossacks, stern measures had to be 
taken against them, the delinquent Cossack villages had 
to be cleared and settled with Chechens. 
The highlanders understood this to mean that the 
Terek Cossacks could now be maltreated with impunity, 
that they could be robbed, their cattle stolen and 
their women dishonoured. 
I must declare that if the highlanders think that, 
they are deeply mistaken. The highlanders must know

J. V. S T A L I N 414 
that the Soviet Government protects all the citizens of 
Russia alike, irrespective of their nationality, regardless of 
whether they are Cossacks or highlanders. Bear in mind 
that if the highlanders do not desist from outrages, 
the Soviet Government will punish them with all the 
severity of revolutionary power. 
The future of the Cossacks, both those who are constituted 
into a separate gubernia and those who remain 
within the Highland Autonomous Republic, will entirely 
depend upon their own behaviour. If the Cossacks 
do not desist from acts of treachery against workers¹ and 
peasants¹ Russia, I must say that the Government will 
again have to resort to repressive measures. 
But if the Cossacks behave in future as honest citizens 
of Russia, I declare here before the whole congress that 
not one hair of the head of any Cossack will be injured. 
The second question is our attitude towards the highlanders 
of the Terek region. 
Comrade highlanders, the old period in the history 
of Russia, when the tsars and tsarist generals trampled 
upon your rights and destroyed your liberties‹that 
period of oppression and slavery has gone for ever. Now, 
when power in Russia has passed into the hands of 
the workers and peasants, there must no more be any who 
are oppressed in Russia. 
In granting you autonomy, Russia restores the liberties 
which were stolen from you by the bloodsucking 
tsars and the tyrannous tsarist generals. This means 
that your internal affairs should be arranged in accordance 
with your manner of life, your habits and customs 
‹of course, within the framework of the general Constitution 
of Russia.

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF THE TEREK REGION 415 
Each of the peoples‹Chechens, Ingushes, Ossetians, 
Kabardinians, Balkarians, Karachais, and also the Cossacks 
who remain within the autonomous highland territory‹
should have its National Soviet to administer 
the affairs of the given people in accordance with its 
manner of life and specific features. There is no need to 
mention the inogorodnie, who were and remain loyal 
sons of Soviet Russia, and whose interests the Soviet 
Government will always staunchly defend. 
If i t is shown that the Sharia is necessary, then 
let the Sharia remain. The Soviet Government has no 
thought of declaring war on the Sharia. 
If it is shown that the organs of the Extraordinary 
Commission and the Special Department are unable to 
adapt themselves to the manner of life and specific 
features of the population, then, clearly, appropriate 
changes must be made in this sphere as well. 
The National Soviets should be headed by a Council 
of People¹s Commissars of the Highland Republic, 
elected by the latter¹s Congress of Soviets and directly 
linked with Moscow. 
Does this mean that the highlanders will be severed 
from Russia, that Russia is abandoning them, that the 
Red Army will be withdrawn to Russia‹as the highlanders 
are asking in alarm? No, it does not. Russia realizes 
that, left to their own resources, the small nationalities 
of the Terek cannot uphold their liberty against 
the world sharks and their agents‹the highland landlords 
who have fled to Georgia and from there are intriguing 
against the labouring highlanders. Autonomy means 
not separation, but union between the self-governing 
highland peoples and the peoples of Russia. It is on this

J. V. S T A L I N 416 
union that the Soviet autonomy of the highlanders 
will rest. 
Comrades, it was usually the case in the past that 
governments consented to grant some reform, to make 
some concession to peoples, only at a time of difficulty, 
when they had been weakened and needed the 
sympathy of their peoples. That was always the case 
with the governments of the tsars and bourgeois governments 
generally. In contrast to them, the Soviet 
Government acts differently. The Soviet Government is 
granting you autonomy not at a time of difficulty, but 
at a time of resounding victories on the battlefields, at 
a time of complete triumph over the last stronghold of 
imperialism, in the Crimea. 
Experience shows that that which governments 
grant in critical moments is insecure and unreliable, 
because it can always be withdrawn when the critical 
moment passes. Reforms and liberties can be secure only 
if they are granted, not under the pressure of momentary, 
temporary necessity, but in full knowledge of 
their usefulness, and when the government is in the full 
flower of its might and strength. That is just how the 
Soviet Government is acting now in restoring you your 
liberties. 
In doing this, the Soviet Government wants you to 
know that it has full confidence in you, comrade highlanders, 
that it has faith in your ability to govern yourselves. 
Let us hope that you will justify this confidence 
of workers¹ and peasants¹ Russia. 
Long Live the Union of the Peoples of the Terek 
Region With the Peoples of Russia!

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF THE TEREK REGION 417 
2. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Comrades, I have received a number of written questions 
on the subject of autonomy. I must reply to them. 
The first question concerns the territorial boundaries 
of the Highland Soviet Republic. In general, the boundaries 
will be the Terek in the North, and, in the other 
directions, the borders of the territories of the peoples 
of the Terek region: Chechens, Ingushes, Kabardinians, 
Ossetians, Balkarians, Karachais, as well as the inogorodnie, 
and also the Cossack villages on this side of 
the Terek. This will constitute the territory of the Autonomous 
Highland Republic. As to the detailed demarcation 
of the boundaries, that should be determined by 
a commission composed of representatives of the Highland 
Republic and the adjacent gubernias. 
Second question: what will be the capital of the Autonomous 
Highland Republic, and will the towns Grozny 
and Vladikavkaz come within the republic? Of course, they 
will. Any town may be chosen as the capital of the republic. 
I personally consider that it should be Vladikavkaz, 
since it is a centre connected with all the nationalities 
of the Terek region. 
The third question concerns the limits of autonomy. 
I am asked what type of autonomy is being granted to 
the Highland Republic. 
There are different kinds of autonomy: administrative, 
such as the Karelians, the Cheremiss, the Chuvashes 
and the Volga Germans enjoy, and political, such 
as is enjoyed by the Bashkirs, Kirghiz and Volga Tatars. 
The autonomy of the Highland Republic will be political 
and, of course, Soviet. It will be of the same type as the

J. V. S T A L I N 418 
autonomy of Bashkiria, Kirghizia and Tataria. This 
means that the Highland Soviet Republic will be headed 
by a Central Executive Committee of Soviets, elected 
by the Congress of Soviets. The Central Executive Committee 
will appoint the Council of People¹s Commissars, 
which will be directly linked with Moscow. The republic 
will be financed out of the general treasury of the Federative 
Republic. The People¹s Commissariats in charge 
of economic and military affairs will be directly linked 
with the corresponding Commissariats in the centre. 
The other Commissariats‹Justice, Agriculture, Internal 
Affairs, Education, etc.‹will be subordinated to the 
Central Executive Committee of the Highland Soviet 
Republic, which will be linked with the All-Russian 
Central Executive Committee. Foreign trade and foreign 
affairs will be entirely under the jurisdiction of the 
central government. 
Then there is a question as to when autonomy will 
come into force. In order to work out the detailed regulations, 
or, to use the formal word, the ³Constitution,² 
of the Republic, representatives should be chosen, 
one from each nationality, who, together with representatives 
of the Government in Moscow, will draft a Constitution 
for the Autonomous Highland Republic. 
It would be as well if you were to elect these representatives 
at this congress, one each from the Chechens, 
Ingushes, Ossetians, Kabardinians, Balkarians, Karachais, 
and from the Cossack villages forming part of the 
Autonomous Highland Republic‹seven representatives 
in all. 
I am asked about the procedure of electing the National 
Soviets. They should be elected in conformity

CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLES OF THE TEREK REGION 419 
with the Constitution, that is, only working people 
should have the right to elect the Soviets. They must 
be Soviets of the working people. 
We in Russia believe that he who does not work, 
neither shall he eat. You must declare that he who does 
not work, neither shall he vote. That is the basis of Soviet 
autonomy. That is the difference between bourgeois and 
Soviet autonomy. 
The next question is about the army. 
We must unquestionably have a common army, 
because the Highland Republic, with its tiny army, 
could not protect its liberty, would be powerless against 
armies subsidized by the Entente. 
Concluding my speech, I want to stress the fundamental 
thing that autonomy can give you, the highlanders. 
The chief evil that has always afflicted the highlanders 
is their backwardness, their ignorance. Only elimination 
of this evil, only broad enlightenment of the 
masses can save the highlanders from extinction and 
introduce them to the benefits of a higher culture. Therefore 
the first thing the highlanders should do in their 
autonomous republic is to build schools and cultural 
and educational institutions. 
The whole purpose of autonomy is to draw the highlanders 
into governing their country themselves. You have 
all too few local persons capable of administering the 
affairs of the people. That is why the agencies of the 
Food Committee, the Extraordinary Commission, the 
Special Department, the national economy, are staffed 
with Russians who are not familiar with your manner of 
life and language. It is essential that your own people

J. V. S T A L I N 420 
be drawn into all branches of the government of your 
country. The autonomy of which we are speaking here 
is to be understood to mean that all governing bodies 
should be staffed with your own people, who are familiar 
with your language and your manner of life. 
That is the meaning of autonomy. 
Autonomy should teach you to stand on your own feet 
‹that is its aim. 
The results of autonomy will not be felt all at once; 
your local forces cannot produce in one day people experienced 
in governing the country. But before two or 
three years have passed you will have acquired an aptitude 
for governing your country, and will be producing 
from your midst teachers, business executives, food officials, 
surveyors, military men, judges and Party and 
Soviet workers generally. And then you will find that 
you have learned the art of self-government. 
Long live the autonomy of the highlands, which 
will teach you how to govern your country, and will 
help you to become as enlightened as the workers and 
peasants of Russia, who have learned not only how 
to govern their country, but also how to vanquish their 
sworn enemies!

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 
Pravda Interview 
Comrade Stalin, who has just returned from an official 
mission in the South, in an interview with our correspondent 
on the situation in the Caucasus stated the following: 
The Caucasus is of major significance to the revolution, 
not only because it is a source of raw materials, 
fuel and food, but also because it lies between Europe 
and Asia, in particular between Russia and Turkey, and 
because of its economically and strategically important 
roads (Batum-Baku, Batum-Tabriz, Batum-Tabriz- 
Erzerum). 
This is fully appreciated by the Entente, which now 
holds Constantinople, the key to the Black Sea, and would 
like to retain the direct road to the East through Transcaucasia. 
The whole question is, who in the end is going to 
be established in the Caucasus and have the use of its 
oil and the supremely important roads into the heart of 
Asia‹the revolution or the Entente? 
The liberation of Azerbaijan has done much to weaken 
the position of the Entente in the Caucasus. The struggle 
of Turkey against the Entente has had the same effect. 
Nevertheless, the Entente has not lost hope and is continuing 
to weave its intrigues in the Caucasus.

J. V. S T A L I N 422 
The conversion of Tiflis into a base of counter-revolutionary 
activity; the formation of bourgeois governments 
of Azerbaijan, Daghestan and the highlanders of 
the Terek region, with the money, of course, of the 
Entente and with the assistance of bourgeois Georgia; the 
coquetting with the Kemalists and the advocacy of a 
federation of Caucasian peoples as a Turkish protectorate; 
the continuous shuffling of Ministers instigated by the 
Entente in Persia and the flooding of that country with 
sepoys‹all this and much else of the same sort shows that 
the old wolves of the Entente are not dozing. The activities 
of the Entente agents in this direction have undoubtedly 
been intensified to fever pitch since the defeat of 
Wrangel. 
What are the chances of the Entente, and what are 
the chances of the revolution, in the Caucasus? 
There is no doubt that in Daghestan and the Terek 
region, for instance, the chances of the Entente have 
shrunk to nil. The defeat of Wrangel and the proclamation 
of Soviet autonomy in Daghestan and the 
Terek region, coupled with the intense development of 
Soviet work in these regions, have strengthened the 
position of the Soviet Government in this area. It is 
no chance thing that people¹s congresses representing the 
millions of the Terek and Daghestan populations have 
solemnly vowed to fight for the Soviets in close alliance 
with the workers and peasants of Russia. 
The fact that the Soviet Government proclaimed their 
autonomy not at a time of difficulty, but at a time 
when its armies had scored resounding victories, is 
duly appreciated by the highlanders as a sign of the 
Government¹s confidence in them. Highlanders have said

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 423 
to me in private conversation: ³That which the government 
grants peoples in time of difficulty, under the 
pressure of momentary necessity, is insecure. Only those 
reforms and liberties are secure which are granted from 
above after the enemy has been vanquished, as the Soviet 
Government is doing now.² 
Just as slim are the chances of the Entente in Azerbaijan, 
which has secured its independence and has 
entered into a voluntary union with the peoples of Russia. 
It scarcely needs demonstrating that the rapacious paw 
the Entente is stretching out to Azerbaijan and the oil 
of Baku can only arouse the loathing of the Azerbaijan 
working people. 
The chances of the Entente in Armenia and Georgia 
have likewise fallen considerably since the defeat of 
Wrangel. Dashnak Armenia undoubtedly fell a victim 
to Entente provocation; the Entente incited it against 
Turkey and then shamefully abandoned it to the tender 
mercies of the Turks. It is scarcely to be doubted that 
only one road of salvation remains open to Armenia: 
union with Soviet Russia. This fact will unquestionably be 
a lesson to all the peoples whose bourgeois governments 
still pay servile homage to the Entente‹to Georgia in 
the first place. 
That Georgia¹s economic and food situation is catastrophic 
is admitted even by its present rulers. The 
Georgia which became enmeshed in the toils of the 
Entente, and in consequence has lost both the oil of 
Baku and the grain of the Kuban, the Georgia which has 
become the main base of British and French imperialist 
operations, and has therefore entered into hostile relations 
with Soviet Russia‹that Georgia is at its last gasp.

J. V. S T A L I N 424 
Small wonder that, having been thrown out of Europe 
by the tide of revolution, Herr Kautsky, the putrefying 
leader of the moribund Second International, has found 
an asylum in this musty Georgia that is enmeshed in the 
net of the Entente, among the bankrupt Georgian socialinnkeepers. 
It is scarcely to be doubted that the Entente 
will abandon Georgia at a moment of difficulty, just 
as it abandoned Armenia. 
In Persia, the position of the British as conquerors 
of that country is becoming more and more transparent. 
We know that the Persian Government, with its kaleidoscopic 
changes of composition, is only a screen for the 
British military attachés. We know that the so-called 
Persian army has ceased to exist, having been replaced 
by British sepoys. We know that this has stirred up a 
number of anti-British demonstrations in Teheran and 
Tabriz. It is scarcely to be doubted that this circumstance 
is not calculated to enhance the Entente¹s chances in 
Persia. 
And lastly, Turkey. The period of the Treaty of 
Sèvres,112 which was directed against Turkey in general 
and against the Kemalists in particular, is undoubtedly 
coming to an end. The struggle of the Kemalists against 
the Entente and the growing ferment that this is stimulating 
in Britain¹s colonies, on the one hand, and the defeat 
of Wrangel and the fall of Venizelos in Greece, on the 
other, have induced the Entente to adopt a much milder 
policy towards the Kemalists. The defeat of Armenia by 
the Kemalists, with the Entente remaining absolutely 
³neutral,² the rumours of the contemplated restoration 
of Thrace and Smyrna to Turkey, the rumours of negotiations 
between the Kemalists and the Sultan who is an

THE SITUATION IN THE CAUCASUS 425 
agent of the Entente, and of a contemplated withdrawal 
from Constantinople, and, lastly, the lull on Turkey¹s 
Western Front‹all these are symptoms which indicate 
that the Entente is flirting furiously with the Kemalists, 
and that the Kemalists are probably executing a 
certain swing to the Right. 
How the Entente¹s flirtation with the Kemalists 
will end, and how far the latter will go in their swing 
to the Right, it is difficult to say. But one thing is 
certain, and that is that the struggle for the emancipation 
of the colonies, begun several years ago, will intensify 
in spite of everything, that Russia, the acknowledged 
standard-bearer of this struggle, will support those who 
champion it with every available means, and that this 
struggle will lead to victory together with the Kemalists, 
if they do not betray the cause of the liberation of the 
oppressed peoples, or in spite of them, if they should 
land in the camp of the Entente. 
Testimony to this is the revolution that is flaring up 
in the West and the growing might of Soviet Russia.

LONG LIVE SOVIET ARMENIA! 
Armenia, so long martyred and tormented, with its 
people condemned by the grace of the Entente and the 
Dashnaks to starvation, ruin and the lot of refugees‹ 
this Armenia, deceived by all its ³friends,² has now 
found salvation by proclaiming itself a Soviet land. 
Neither the false assurances of Britain, the ³ancient 
protector² of Armenian interests, nor Wilson¹s celebrated 
fourteen points,113 nor yet the ostentatious promises of 
the League of Nations, with its ³mandate² for the 
administration of Armenia, had saved (or could save!) 
the Armenians from massacre and physical extermination. 
Only the idea of Soviet power has brought Armenia peace 
and the possibility of national renovation. 
Here are some of the factors that have led to the sovietization 
of Armenia. The fatal policy of the Dashnaks, 
those agents of the Entente, condemned the country to 
anarchy and poverty. The war instigated by the Dashnaks 
against Turkey reduced Armenia to the last extreme 
of misery. In the latter part of November, the northern 
provinces of Armenia, tormented by hunger and tyranny, 
rose in revolt and set up an Armenian Revolutionary 
Military Committee, headed by Comrade Kasyan. On November 
30, a telegram of greetings, addressed to Comrade

LONG LIVE SOVIET ARMENIA! 427 
Lenin, was received from the Chairman of the Armenian 
Revolutionary Military Committee, announcing the birth 
of Soviet Armenia and the occupation of the town of Delijan 
by the Committee. On December 1, Soviet Azerbaijan 
voluntarily renounced its claim to the disputed provinces 
and ceded Zangezur, Nakhichevan and Nagorny Karabakh 
to Soviet Armenia. On December 1, the Revolutionary 
Committee received the congratulations of the Turkish 
command. On December 2, information was received 
from Comrade Ordjonikidze that the Dashnak government 
in Erivan had been driven out and that the Armenian 
troops were placing themselves under the orders of the 
Revolutionary Committee. 
The capital of Armenia, Erivan, is now in the hands 
of the Armenian Soviet Government. 
The age-old enmity between Armenia and the surrounding 
Moslem peoples has been dispelled at one 
stroke by the establishment of fraternal solidarity between 
the working people of Armenia, Turkey and Azerbaijan. 
Let it be known to all concerned that the so-called 
Armenian ³problem,² over which the old wolves of 
imperialist diplomacy racked their brains in vain, only 
Soviet power has proved capable of solving. 
Long Live Soviet Armenia!

demanded that the Germans should cease removing railway 
equipment and other property from Lithuania and should

of Lithuania, observe with the deepest admiration the heroic 
gallantry you are displaying in the struggle against the armed 
forces of counter-revolution. We also greet the worker and 
peasant sons of Lithuania who have joined the Red Army and

resolution of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, 
adopted on the report of J. V. Stalin on December 23, 1918, 
stated: ³Now that the Soviet Republics of Estland, Latvia 
and Lithuania have been established as a result of the revolutionary 
struggle of the proletarian and peasant masses, the 
Central Executive Committee re-affirms that the fact that these 
countries formerly belonged to the old tsarist empire does not 
impose any obligations upon them. At the same time the Central 
Executive Committee expresses the firm confidence that only 
now, with the recognition of full liberty of self-determination 
and with the transfer of power to the working class, will a 
free, voluntary and indestructible union of the working people 
of all the nations inhabiting the territory of the former Russian 
Empire be created. . . .² p. 188 
49 In connection with the catastrophic situation which had arisen 
on the Eastern Front, and particularly in the sector of the Third 
Army, the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), on the motion of V. I. Lenin, 
decided on December 30, 1918, to send J. V. Stalin to the 
Eastern Front. On January 1, 1919, a commission consisting 
of two members of the C.C., J. V. Stalin and F. E. Dzerzhinsky, 
was appointed by the Central Committee of the Party and 
the Council of Defence to investigate the reasons for the surrender 
of Perm and the reverses at the front, as well as to 
adopt measures for the restoration of Party and Soviet work 
in the area of the Third and Second Armies. On January 3,

1919, J. V. Stalin and F. E. Dzerzhinsky left for the Eastern 
Front, where they carried out a great deal of work 
for restoring the fighting efficiency of the Third Army and 
strengthening the front and rear. By the end of the month, 
thanks to their labours, a decisive turn was achieved on the 
Eastern Front. p. 190 
50 On January 13, 1919, J. V. Stalin and F. E. Dzerzhinsky sent 
V. I. Lenin and the Party Central Committee a ³Brief Preliminary 
Report² on the progress of the inquiry into the reasons 
for the Perm disaster. It also outlined the measures proposed 
by the commission for restoring the situation in the Third 
Army sector and to enable the army to pass to the offensive. 
In response to the report, V. I. Lenin, on January 14, sent 
the following telegram: 
³To Stalin and Dzerzhinsky at their address in Glazov.

On March 12, 1918, its place of publication was transferred 
to Moscow and its title was changed to Izvestia of 
the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of

April 22, 1912, to July 8, 1914. It resumed publication after 
the February Revolution, on March 5, 1917, as the Central 
Organ of the Bolshevik Party. On March 15, 1917, J. V. Stalin 
was appointed a member of its editorial board. On his return 
to Russia in April 1917, V. I. Lenin took over the direction 
of Pravda. V. M. Molotov, Y. M. Sverdlov, M. S. Olminsky and 
K. N. Samoilova were among the newspaper¹s regular contributors. 
At the period referred to in the article, Pravda, in spite 
of the vilification and persecution to which it was subjected, 
contributed immensely to rallying the workers and revolutionary 
soldiers and peasants around the Bolshevik Party, exposed 
the imperialist bourgeoisie and its hangers-on, the Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries, and worked for a transition 
from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to a socialist 
revolution. p. 249

R.C.P.(B.); 3) The Communist International; 4) Military situation 
and military policy; 5) Work in the countryside; 6) Organizational 
questions; 7) Election of the Central Committee. 
The report of the Central Committee and the reports on the 
Party Programme and on the work in the countryside were 
made by V. I. Lenin. 
The military question was discussed at plenary meetings 
of the congress and in a military section. There was a socalled 
³Military Opposition² at the congress, comprising former 
³Left Communists² and some Party workers who had 
not formerly participated in any opposition grouping but who 
were dissatisfied with Trotsky¹s leadership of the army. They 
attacked Trotsky for his distortions of the Party¹s military 
policy and for his anti-Party practices, but at the same time 
they defended the survivals of guerilla mentality in the 
army and other incorrect views on questions concerning the 
building of the army. V. I. Lenin and J . V. Stalin spoke 
against the ³Military Opposition.² The congress, while rejecting 
a number of the proposals of the ³Military Opposition² 
(Smirnov¹s project), condemned Trotsky¹s position as harmful. 
The Military Commission appointed by the congress, of 
which Stalin and Yaroslavsky were members, drafted a resolution 
on the military question which was adopted by the 
congress unanimously.

conference was that of economic policy. The anti-Party ³Democratic 
Centralism² group (Sapronov, etc.), who in the 
discussion on this question opposed the principle of one-man 
management in industry, received a rebuff. On the question 
of work in the countryside, the conference adopted an important 
decision providing for the formation in the Ukraine of 
unions of small and landless peasants (Committees of Poor 
Peasants). The conference elected J . V. Stalin as a delegate 
to the Ninth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.). p. 306

87 Borotbists‹Ukrainian Left Socialist-Revolutionaries who had 
formed a separate party in May 1918. Their name derived 
from their central organ, Borotba (Struggle). In March 1920, 
owing to the growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the 
Ukrainian peasant masses, the Borotbists were compelled to 
dissolve their party and apply for membership in the Ukrainian 
Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The Fourth Conference of the 
Ukr.C.P.(B.) decided to admit them to the Party, but they 
were accepted only after re-registration. In subsequent years 
many of the Borotbists took the path of double-dealing and 
deception of the Party and led the movement of the anti-Soviet 
counter-revolutionary nationalist elements in the Ukraine, 
proving themselves to be vile enemies of the Ukrainian people.

98 The Tammerfors Conference‹the first conference of the Bolsheviks, 
held December 12-17, 1905. It was at this conference 
that V. I. Lenin and J. V. Stalin met for the first time; until 
then they had maintained contact by correspondence or through 
comrades. 
The agenda of the conference was as follows: 1) Reports 
from the local organizations; 2) Report on the current situation; 
3) Organizational report of the C.C.; 4) Merging of the two sections 
of the R.S.D.L.P.; 5) Re-organization of the Party; 6) The 
agrarian question; 7) The State Duma. 
The reports on the current situation and on the agrarian 
question were delivered by V. I. Lenin, who also spoke on 
the attitude towards the Witte Duma. J. V. Stalin reported 
on the activities of the Transcaucasian Bolshevik organization 
and spoke in support of Lenin¹s tactics of actively boycotting 
the Duma. The conference adopted a decision on the re-unification 
of the Party, which was virtually split into two separate 
parties, and approved V. I. Lenin¹s resolution on the 
agrarian question. J. V. Stalin and V. I. Lenin were members 
of the commission which drafted the resolution on the 
attitude towards the Duma. The resolution called upon the 
Party and the working class to boycott the Duma and recommended 
all the Party organizations to make wide use of the 
election meetings for the purpose of extending the revolutionary 
organization of the proletariat and for conducting 
agitation among all sections of the people in favour of an 
armed uprising. p. 328
