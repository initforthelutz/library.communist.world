HISTORY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY 
OF THE SOVIET UNION 
(Bolsheviks)


I N T R O D U C T I O N 
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has traversed 
a long and glorious road, leading from the first tiny Marxist 
circles and groups that appeared in Russia in the eighties of the past 
century to the great Party of the Bolsheviks, which now directs the 
first Socialist State of Workers and Peasants in the world. 
The C.P.S.U.(B.) grew up on the basis of the working-class 
movement in pre-revolutionary Russia; it sprang from the Marxist circles 
and groups which had established connection with the working-class movement 
and imparted to it a Socialist consciousness. The C.P.S.U.(B.) 
has always been guided by the revolutionary teachings of Marxism- 
Leninism. In the new conditions of the era of imperialism, imperialist 
wars and proletarian revolutions, its leaders further developed the teachings 
of Marx and Engels and raised them to a new level. 
The C.P.S.U.(B.) grew and gained strength in a fight over fundamental 
principles waged against the petty-bourgeois parties within the 
working-class movementthe Socialist-Revolutionaries (and earlier still, 
against their predecessors, the Narodniks), the Mensheviks, Anarchists 
and bourgeois nationalists of all shadesand, within the Party itself, 
against the Menshevik, opportunist trendsthe Trotskyites, Bukharinites, 
nationalist deviators and other anti-Leninist groups. 
The C.P.S.U.(B.) gained strength and became tempered in the 
revolutionary struggle against all enemies of the working class and of 
all working peopleagainst landlords, capitalists, kulaks, wreckers, spies, 
against all the hirelings of the surrounding capitalist states. 
The history of the C.P.S.U.(B.) is the history of three revolutions: 
the bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1905, the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution of February 1917, and the Socialist revolution of October 
1917. 
The history of the C.P.S.U.(B.) is the history of the overthrow 
I

of tsardom, of the overthrow of the power of the landlords and capitalists; 
it is the history of the rout of the armed foreign intervention during 
the Civil War; it is the history of the building of the Soviet state and 
of Socialist society in our country. 
The study of the history of the C.P.S.U.(B.) enriches us with the 
experience of the fight for Socialism waged by the workers and peasants 
of our country. 
The study of the history of the C.P.S.U.(B.), the history of the 
struggle of our Party against all enemies of Marxism-Leninism, against 
all enemies of the working people, helps us to master Bolshevism and 
sharpens our political vigilance. 
The study of the heroic history of the Bolshevik Party arms us with a 
knowledge of the laws of social development and of the political struggle, 
with a knowledge of the motive forces of revolution. 
The study of the history of the C.P.S.U.(B.) strengthens our 
certainty of the ultimate victory of the great cause of the Party of Lenin- 
Stalin, the victory of Communism throughout the world. 
This book sets forth briefly the history of the Communist Party of 
the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).

C H A P T E R O N E 
THE STRUGGLE FOR THE CREATION 
OF A SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY 
IN RUSSIA 
( 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 ) 
1. ABOLITION OF SERFDOM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL 
CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA. RISE OF THE MODERN INDUSTRIAL 
PROLETARIAT. FIRST STEPS OF THE WORKING-CLASS 
MOVEMENT 
Tsarist Russia entered the path of capitalist development later than 
other countries. Prior to the sixties of the past century there were very 
few mills and factories in Russia. Manorial estates based on serfdom 
constituted the prevailing form of economy. There could be no real development 
of industry under serfdom. The involuntary labour of the serfs 
in agriculture was of low productivity. The whole course of economic 
development made the abolition of serfdom imperative. In 1861, the 
tsarist government, weakened by defeat in the Crimean War, and 
frightened by the peasant revolts against the landlords, was compelled 
to abolish serfdom. 
But even after serfdom had been abolished the landlords continued 
to oppress the peasants. In the process of ³emancipation² they robbed 
the peasants by inclosing, cutting off, considerable portions of the land 
previously used by the peasants. These cut-off portions of land were 
called by the peasants otrezki (cuts). The peasants were compelled to 
pay about 2,000,000,000 rubles to the landlords as the redemption price 
for their ³emancipation.² 
After serfdom had been abolished the peasants were obliged to rent 
land from the landlords on most onerous terms. In addition to paying 
money rent, the peasants were often compelled by the landlord to cultivate 
without remuneration a definite portion of his land with their own 
implements and horses. This was called otrabotki or barshchina (labour 
rent, corvée). In most cases the peasants were obliged to pay the landlords 
rent in kind in the amount of one-half of their harvests. This was 
known as ispolu (half and half system). 
Thus the situation remained almost the same as it had been under 
3

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 4
serfdom, the only difference being that the peasant was now personally 
free, could not be bought and sold like a chattel. 
The landlords bled the backward peasant farms white by various 
methods of extortion (rent, fines). Owing to the oppression of the landlords 
the bulk of the peasantry were unable to improve their farms. 
Hence the extreme backwardness of agriculture in pre-revolutionary 
Russia, which led to frequent crop failures and famines. 
The survivals of serfdom, crushing taxation and the redemption payments 
to the landlords, which not infrequently exceeded the income of 
the peasant household, ruined the peasants, reduced them to pauperism 
and forced them to quit their villages in search of a livelihood. 
They went to work in the mills and factories. This was a source of 
cheap labour power for the manufacturers. 
Over the workers and peasants stood a veritable army of sheriffs, 
deputy sheriffs, gendarmes, constables, rural police, who protected the 
tsar, the capitalists and the landlords from the toiling and exploited people. 
Corporal punishment existed right up to 1903. Although serfdom 
had been abolished the peasants were flogged for the slightest offence 
and for the non-payment of taxes. Workers were manhandled by the 
police and the Cossacks, especially during strikes, when the workers 
downed tools because their lives had been made intolerable by the manufacturers. 
Under the tsars the workers and peasants had no political 
rights whatever. The tsarist autocracy was the worst enemy of the people. 
Tsarist Russia was a prison of nations. The numerous non-Russian 
nationalities were entirely devoid of rights and were subjected to constant 
insult and humiliation of every kind. The tsarist government taught the 
Russian population to look down upon the native peoples of the national 
regions as an inferior race, officially referred to them as inorodtsi 
(aliens), and fostered contempt and hatred of them. The tsarist government 
deliberately fanned national discord, instigated one nation against 
another, engineered Jewish pogroms and, in Transcaucasia, incited Tatars 
and Armenians to massacre each other. 
Nearly all, if not all, government posts in the national regions were 
held by Russian officials. All business in government institutions and in 
the courts was conducted in the Russian language. It was forbidden 
to publish newspapers and books in the languages of the non-Russian 
nationalities or to teach in the schools in the native tongue. The tsarist 
government strove to extinguish every spark of national culture and 
pursued a policy of forcible ³Russification.² Tsardom was a hangman 
and torturer of the non-Russian peoples. 
After the abolition of serfdom, the development of industrial cap

5 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
italism in Russia proceeded at a fairly rapid pace in spite of the fact that 
it was still hampered by survivals of serfdom. During the twenty-five 
years, 1865-90, the number of workers employed in large mills and 
factories and on the railways increased from 706,000 to 1,433,000, or 
more than doubled. 
Large-scale capitalist industry in Russia began to develop even 
more rapidly in the nineties. By the end of that decade the number of 
workers employed in the large mills and factories, in the mining industry 
and on the railways amounted in the fifty European provinces of Russia 
alone to 2,207,000, and in the whole of Russia to 2,792,000 persons. 
This was a modern industrial proletariat, radically different from 
the workers employed in the factories of the period of serfdom and from 
the workers in small, handicraft and other kinds of industry, both because 
of the spirit of solidarity prevailing among the workers in big capitalist 
enterprises and because of their militant revolutionary qualities. 
The industrial boom of the nineties was chiefly due to intensive 
railroad construction. During the course of the decade (1890-1900) 
over 21,000 versts of new railway line were laid. The railways created 
a big demand for metal (for rails, locomotives and cars), and also for 
increasing quantities of fuelcoal and oil. This led to the development 
of the metal and fuel industries. 
In pre-revolutionary Russia, as in all capitalist countries, periods of 
industrial boom alternated with industrial crises, stagnation, which severely 
affected the working class and condemned hundreds of thousands 
of workers to unemployment and poverty. 
Although the development of capitalism in Russia proceeded fairly 
rapidly after the abolition of serfdom, nevertheless, in economic development 
Russia lagged considerably behind other capitalist countries. The 
vast majority of the population was still engaged in agriculture. In his 
celebrated work, The Development of Capitalism in Russia Lenin cited 
significant figures from the general census of the population of 1897 
which showed that about five-sixths of the total population were engaged 
in agriculture, and only one-sixth in large and small industry, trade, on 
the railways and waterways, in building work, lumbering, and so on. 
This shows that although capitalism was developing in Russia, she 
was still an agrarian, economically backward country, a petty-bourgeois 
country, that is, a country in which low-productive individual peasant 
farming based on small ownership still predominated. 
Capitalism was developing not only in the towns but also in the 
countryside. The peasantry, the most numerous class in pre-revolutionary 
Russia, was undergoing a process of disintegration, of cleavage.

From among the more well-to-do peasants there was emerging an upper 
layer of kulaks, the rural bourgeoisie, while on the other hand many 
peasants were being ruined, and the number of poor peasants, rural 
proletarians and semi-proletarians, was on the increase. As to the middle 
peasants, their number decreased from year to year. 
In I903 there were about ten million peasant households in Russia. 
In his pamphlet entitled To the Village Poor, Lenin calculated that of 
this total not less than three and a half million households consisted of 
peasants possessing no horses. These were the poorest peasants who usually 
sowed only a small part of their land, leased the rest to the kulaks, 
and themselves left to seek other sources of livelihood. The position of 
these peasants came nearest to that of the proletariat. Lenin called them 
rural proletarians or semi-proletarians. 
On the other hand, one and a half million rich, kulak households 
(out of a total of ten million peasant households) concentrated in their 
hands half the total sown area of the peasants. This peasant bourgeoisie 
was growing rich by grinding down the poor and middle peasantry and 
profiting from the toil of agricultural labourers, and was developing into 
rural capitalists. 
The working class of Russia began to awaken already in the seventies, 
and especially in the eighties, and started a struggle against the capitalists. 
Exceedingly hard was the lot of the workers in tsarist Russia. In 
the eighties the working day in the mills and factories was not less than 
I2 I/2 hours, and in the textile industry reached I4 to I5 hours. The 
exploitation of female and child labour was widely resorted to. Children 
worked the same hours as adults, but, like the women, received a much 
smaller wage. Wages were inordinately low. The majority of the 
workers were paid seven or eight rubles per month. The most highly 
paid workers in the metal works and foundries received no more than 
35 rubles per month. There were no regulations for the protection of 
labour, with the result that workers were maimed and killed in large 
numbers. Workers were not insured, and all medical services had to 
be paid for. Housing conditions were appalling. In the factory-owned 
barracks, workers were crowded as many as I0 or I2 to a small ³cell.² 
In paying wages, the manufacturers often cheated the workers, compelled 
them to make their purchases in the factory-owned shops at 
exorbitant prices, and mulcted them by means of fines. 
The workers began to take a common stand and present joint demands 
to the factory workers for the improvement of their intolerable 
conditions. They would down tools and go on strike. The earlier strikes 
in the seventies and eighties were usually provoked by excessive fines,

7 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
cheating and swindling of the workers over wages, and reductions in 
the rates of pay. 
In the earlier strikes, the workers, driven to despair, would sometimes 
smash machinery, break factory windows and wreck factoryowned 
shops and factory offices. 
The more advanced workers began to realize that if they were to 
be successful in their struggle against the capitalists, they needed organization. 
Workers¹ unions began to arise. 
In 1875 the South Russian Workers¹ Union was formed in Odessa. 
This first workers¹ organization lasted eight or nine months and was 
then smashed by the tsarist government. 
In 1878 the Northern Union of Russian Workers was formed in 
St. Petersburg, headed by Khalturin, a carpenter, and Obnorsky, a fitter. 
The program of the Union stated that its aims and objects were similar 
to those of the Social-Democratic labour parties of the West. The ultimate 
aim of the Union was to bring about a Socialist revolution³the 
overthrow of the existing political and economic system, as an extremely 
unjust system.² Obnorsky, one of the founders of the Union, had lived 
abroad for some time and had there acquainted himself with the activities 
of the Marxist Social-Democratic parties and of the First International, 
which was directed by Marx. This circumstance left its impress on the 
program of the Northern Union of Russian Workers. The immediate 
aim of the Union was to win political liberty and political rights for the 
people (freedom of speech, press, assembly, etc.). The immediate demands 
also included a reduction of the working day. 
The membership of the Union reached 200, and it had about as 
many sympathizers. It began to take part in workers¹ strikes, to lead 
them. The tsarist government smashed this workers¹ Union too. 
But the working-class movement continued to grow, spreading from 
district to district. The eighties were marked by a large number of 
strikes. In the space of five years (1881-86) there were as many as 48 
strikes involving 80,000 workers. 
An exceptional part in the history of the revolutionary movement 
was played by the big strike that broke out at the Morozov mill in 
Orekhovo-Zuyevo in 1885. 
About 8,000 workers were employed at this mill. Working conditions 
grew worse from day to day: there were five wage cuts between 
1882 and 1884, and in the latter year rates were reduced by 25 per 
cent at one blow. In addition, Morozov, the manufacturer, tormented 
the workers with fines. It was revealed at the trial which followed the 
strike that of every ruble earned by the workers, from 30 to 50 kopeks

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 8
went into the pocket of the manufacturer in the form of fines. The 
workers could not stand this robbery any longer and in January 1885 
went out on strike. The strike had been organized beforehand. It was 
led by a politically advanced worker, Pyotr Moiseyenko, who had been a 
member of the Northern Union of Russian Workers and already had 
some revolutionary experience. On the eve of the strike Moiseyenko and 
others of the more class-conscious weavers drew up a number of demands 
for presentation to the mill owners; they were endorsed at a secret meeting 
of the workers. The chief demand was the abolition of the rapacious 
fines. 
This strike was suppressed by armed force. Over 600 workers were 
arrested and scores of them committed for trial. 
Similar strikes broke out in the mills of Ivanovo-Voznesensk in 1885. 
In the following year the tsarist government was compelled by its 
fear of the growth of the working-class movement to promulgate a law 
on fines which provided that the proceeds from fines were not to go 
into the pockets of the manufacturers but were to be used for the needs 
of the workers themselves. 
The Morozov and other strikes taught the workers that a great 
deal could be gained by organized struggle. The working-class movement 
began to produce capable leaders and organizers who staunchly 
championed the interests of the working class. 
At the same time, on the basis of the growth of the working-class 
movement and under the influence of the working-class movement of 
Western Europe, the first Marxist organizations began to arise in Russia. 
2. NARODISM (POPULISM) AND MARXISM IN RUSSIA. PLEKHANOV 
AND HIS ³EMANCIPATION OF LABOUR² GROUP. PLEKHANOV¹S 
FIGHT AGAINST NARODISM. SPREAD OF MARXISM IN RUSSIA 
Prior to the appearance of the Marxist groups revolutionary work 
in Russia was carried on by the Narodniks (Populists), who were 
opponents of Marxism. 
The first Russian Marxist group arose in 1883. This was the 
³Emancipation of Labour² group formed by G. V. Plekhanov abroad, 
in Geneva, where he had been obliged to take refuge from the persecution 
of the tsarist government for his revolutionary activities. 
Previously Plekhanov had himself been a Narodnik. But having 
studied Marxism while abroad, he broke with Narodism and became an 
outstanding propagandist of Marxism.

9 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
The ³Emancipation of Labour² group did a great deal to disseminate 
Marxism in Russia. They translated works of Marx and 
Engels into RussianThe Communist Manifesto, Wage-Labour and 
Capital, Socialism, Utopian and Scientific, etc.had them printed abroad 
and circulated them secretly in Russia. Plekhanov, Zasulich, Axelrod and 
other members of this group also wrote a number of works explaining 
the teachings of Marx and Engels, the ideas of scientific Socialism. 
Marx and Engels, the great teachers of the proletariat, were the 
first to explain that, contrary to the opinion of the utopian Socialists, 
Socialism was not the invention of dreamers (utopians), but the inevitable 
outcome of the development of modern capitalist society. They 
showed that the capitalist system would fall, just as serfdom had 
fallen, and that capitalism was creating its own gravediggers in the 
person of the proletariat. They showed that only the class struggle of 
the proletariat, only the victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, 
would rid humanity of capitalism and exploitation. 
Marx and Engels taught the proletariat to be conscious of its own 
strength, to be conscious of its class interests and to unite for a determined 
struggle against the bourgeoisie. Marx and Engels discovered the 
laws of development of capitalist society and proved scientifically that 
the development of capitalist society, and the class struggle going on 
within it, must inevitably lead to the fall of capitalism, to the victory 
of the proletariat, to the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Marx and Engels taught that it was impossible to get rid of the 
power of capital and to convert capitalist property into public property by 
peaceful means, and that the working class could achieve this only by 
revolutionary violence against the bourgeoisie, by a proletarian revolution, 
by establishing its own political rulethe dictatorship of the proletariat 
which must crush the resistance of the exploiters and create a new, 
classless, Communist society. 
Marx and Engels taught that the industrial proletariat is the most 
revolutionary and therefore the most advanced class in capitalist society, 
and that only a class like the proletariat could rally around itself all the 
forces discontented with capitalism and lead them in the storming of 
capitalism. But in order to vanquish the old world and create a new, 
classless society, the proletariat must have its own working-class party, 
which Marx and Engels called the Communist Party. 
It was to the dissemination of the views of Marx and Engels that 
the first Russian Marxist group, Plekhanov¹s ³Emancipation of Labour² 
group, devoted itself. 
The ³Emancipation of Labour² group raised the banner of Marx

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 10 
ism in the Russian press abroad at a time when no Social-Democratic 
movement in Russia yet existed. It was first necessary to prepare the 
theoretical, ideological ground for such a movement. The chief ideological 
obstacle to the spread of Marxism and of the Social-Democratic 
movement was the Narodnik views which at that time prevailed among 
the advanced workers and the revolutionary-minded intelligentsia. 
As capitalism developed in Russia the working class became a 
powerful and advanced force that was capable of waging an organized 
revolutionary struggle. But the leading role of the working class was 
not understood by the Narodniks. The Russian Narodniks erroneously 
held that the principal revolutionary force was not the working class, 
but the peasantry, and that the rule of the tsar and the landlords could 
be overthrown by means of peasant revolts alone. The Narodniks did 
not know the working class and did not realize that the peasants alone 
were incapable of vanquishing tsardom and the landlords without an 
alliance with the working class and without its guidance. The Narodniks 
did not understand that the working class was the most revolutionary 
and the most advanced class of society. 
The Narodniks first endeavoured to rouse the peasants for a struggle 
against the tsarist government. With this purpose in view, young 
revolutionary intellectuals donned peasant garb and flocked to the countryside³
to the people,² as it used to be called. Hence the term ³Narodnik,² 
from the word narod, the people. But they found no backing 
among the peasantry, for they did not have a proper knowledge or 
understanding of the peasants either. The majority of them were arrested 
by the police. Thereupon the Narodniks decided to continue the 
struggle against the tsarist autocracy single-handed, without the people, 
and this led to even more serious mistakes. 
A secret Narodnik society known as ³Narodnaya Volya² (³People¹s 
Will²) began to plot the assassination of the tsar. On March 
1, 1881, members of the ³Narodnaya Volya² succeeded in killing Tsar 
Alexander II with a bomb. But the people did not benefit from this in 
any way. The assassination of individuals could not bring about the 
overthrow of the tsarist autocracy or the abolition of the landlord class. 
The assassinated tsar was replaced by another, Alexander III, under 
whom the conditions of the workers and peasants became still worse. 
The method of combating tsardom chosen by the Narodniks, 
namely, by the assassination of individuals, by individual terrorism, was 
wrong and detrimental to the revolution. The policy of individual terrorism 
was based on the erroneous Narodnik theory of active ³heroes² 
and a passive ³mob,² which awaited exploits from the ³heroes.² This

11 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
false theory maintained that it is only outstanding individuals who make 
history, while the masses, the people, the class, the ³mob,² as the Narodnik 
writers contemptuously called them, are incapable of conscious, 
organized activity and can only blindly follow the ³heroes.² For this 
reason the Narodniks abandoned mass revolutionary work among the 
peasantry and the working class and changed to individual terrorism. 
They induced one of the most prominent revolutionaries of the time, 
Stepan Khalturin, to give up his work of organizing a revolutionary 
workers¹ union and to devote himself entirely to terrorism. 
By these assassinations of individual representatives of the class of exploiters, 
assassinations that were of no benefit to the revolution, the 
Narodniks diverted the attention of the working people from the struggle 
against that class as a whole. They hampered the development of the 
revolutionary initiative and activity of the working class and the peasantry. 
The Narodniks prevented the working class from understanding its 
leading role in the revolution and retarded the creation of an independent 
party of the working class. 
Although the Narodniks¹ secret organization had been smashed by 
the tsarist government, Narodnik views continued to persist for a long 
time among the revolutionary-minded intelligentsia. The surviving 
Narodniks stubbornly resisted the spread of Marxism in Russia and 
hampered the organization of the working class. 
Marxism in Russia could therefore grow and gain strength only by 
combating Narodism. 
The ³Emancipation of Labour² group launched a fight against the 
erroneous views of the Narodniks and showed how greatly their views 
and methods of struggle were prejudicing the working-class movement. 
In his writings directed against the Narodniks, Plekhanov showed 
that their views had nothing in common with scientific Socialism, even 
though they called themselves Socialists. 
Plekhanov was the first to give a Marxist criticism of the erroneous 
views of the Narodniks. Delivering well-aimed blows at the Narodnik 
views, Plekhanov at the same time developed a brilliant defence of the 
Marxist views. 
What were the major errors of the Narodniks which Plekhanov 
hammered at with such destructive effect? 
First, the Narodniks asserted that capitalism was something ³accidental² 
in Russia, that it would not develop, and that therefore the 
proletariat would not grow and develop either.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 12 
Secondly, the Narodniks did not regard the working class as the 
foremost class in the revolution. They dreamed of attaining Socialism 
without the proletariat. They considered that the principal revolutionary 
force was the peasantryled by the intelligentsiaand the peasant commune, 
which they regarded as the embryo and foundation of Socialism. 
Thirdly, the Narodniks¹ view of the whole course of human history 
was erroneous and harmful. They neither knew nor understood the 
laws of the economic and political development of society. In this respect 
they were quite backward. According to them, history was made not 
by classes, and not by the struggle of classes, but by outstanding individuals³
heroes²who were blindly followed by the masses, the ³mob,² 
the people, the classes. 
In combating and exposing the Narodniks Plekhanov wrote a 
number of Marxist works which were instrumental in rearing and educating 
the Marxists in Russia. Such works of his as Socialism and the 
Political Struggle, Our Differences, On the Development of the Monistic 
View of History cleared the way for the victory of Marxism in 
Russia. 
In his works Plekhanov expounded the basic principles of Marxism. 
Of particular importance was his On the Development of the Monistic 
View of History, published in 1895. Lenin said that this book served 
to ³rear a whole generation of Russian Marxists.² (Lenin, Collected 
Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XIV, p. 347.) 
In his writings aimed against the Narodniks, Plekhanov showed that 
it was absurd to put the question the way the Narodniks did: should 
capitalism develop in Russia or not? As a matter of fact Russia had 
already entered the path of capitalist development, Plekhanov said, producing 
facts to prove it, and there was no force that could divert her 
from this path. 
The task of the revolutionaries was not to arrest the development 
of capitalism in Russiathat they could not do anyhow. Their task was 
to secure the support of the powerful revolutionary force brought into 
being by the development of capitalism, namely, the working class, to 
develop its class-consciousness, to organize it, and to help it to create its 
own working-class party. 
Plekhanov also shattered the second major error of the Narodniks, 
namely, their denial of the role of the proletariat as the vanguard in 
the revolutionary struggle. The Narodniks looked upon the rise of the 
proletariat in Russia as something in the nature of a ³historical misfortune,² 
and spoke of the ³ulcer of proletarianism.² Plekhanov, championing 
the teachings of Marxism, showed that they were fully applicable

13 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
to Russia and that in spite of the numerical preponderance of the peasantry 
and the relative numerical weakness of the proletariat, it was on the 
proletariat and on its growth that the revolutionaries should base their 
chief hopes. 
Why on the proletariat? 
Because the proletariat, although it was still numerically small, was 
a labouring class which was connected with the most advanced form of 
economy, large-scale production, and which for this reason had a great 
future before it. 
Because the proletariat, as a class, was growing from year to year, 
was developing politically, easily lent itself to organization owing to the 
conditions of labour prevailing in large-scale production, and was the 
most revolutionary class owing to its proletarian status, for it had nothing 
to lose in the revolution but its chains. 
The case was different with the peasantry. 
The peasantry (meaning here the individual peasants, each of whom 
worked for himselfEd.), despite its numerical strength, was a labouring 
class that was connected with the most backward form of economy, 
small-scale production, owing to which it had not and could not have 
any great future before it. 
Far from growing as a class, the peasantry was splitting up more and 
more into bourgeois (kulaks) and poor peasants (proletarians and semiproletarians). 
Moreover, being scattered, it lent itself less easily than 
the proletariat to organization, and, consisting of small owners, it joined 
the revolutionary movement less readily than the proletariat. 
The Narodniks maintained that Socialism in Russia would come 
not through the dictatorship of the proletariat, but through the peasant 
commune, which they regarded as the embryo and basis of Socialism. 
But the commune was neither the basis nor the embryo of Socialism, 
nor could it be, because the commune was dominated by the kulaksthe 
bloodsuckers who exploited the poor peasants, the agricultural labourers 
and the economically weaker middle peasants. The formal existence of 
communal land ownership and the periodical redivision of the land according 
to the number of mouths in each peasant household did not alter 
the situation in any way. Those members of the commune used the land 
who owned draught cattle, implements and seed, that is, the well-to-do 
middle peasants and kulaks. The peasants who possessed no horses, the 
poor peasants, the small peasants generally, had to surrender their land to 
the kulaks and to hire themselves out as agricultural labourers. As a matter 
of fact, the peasant commune was a convenient means of masking the 
dominance of the kulaks and an inexpensive instrument in the hands of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 14 
the tsarist government for the collection of taxes from the peasants on 
the basis of collective responsibility. That was why tsardom left the 
peasant commune intact. It was absurd to regard a commune of this 
character as the embryo or basis of Socialism. 
Plekhanov shattered the third major error of the Narodniks as well, 
namely, that ³heroes,² outstanding individuals, and their ideas played 
a prime role in social development, and that the role of the masses, the 
³mob,² the people, classes, was insignificant. Plekhanov accused the 
Narodniks of idealism, and showed that the truth lay not with idealism, 
but with the materialism of Marx and Engels. 
Plekhanov expounded and substantiated the view of Marxist materialism. 
In conformity with Marxist materialism, he showed that in the 
long run the development of society is determined not by the wishes 
and ideas of outstanding individuals, but by the development of the 
material conditions of existence of society, by the changes in the mode 
of production of the material wealth required for the existence of society, 
by the changes in the mutual relations of classes in the production of 
material wealth, by the struggle of classes for place and position in the 
production and distribution of material wealth. It was not ideas that 
determined the social and economic status of men, but the social and 
economic status of men that determined their ideas. Outstanding individuals 
may become nonentities if their ideas and wishes run counter 
to the economic development of society, to the needs of the foremost 
class; and vice versa, outstanding people may really become outstanding 
individuals if their ideas and wishes correctly express the needs of the 
economic development of society, the needs of the foremost class. 
In answer to the Narodniks¹ assertion that the masses are nothing 
but a mob, and that it is heroes who make history and convert the mob 
into a people, the Marxists affirmed that it is not heroes that make 
history, but history that makes heroes, and that, consequently, it is not 
heroes who create a people, but the people who create heroes and move 
history onward. Heroes, outstanding individuals, may play an important 
part in the life of society only in so far as they are capable of correctly 
understanding the conditions of development of society and the ways of 
changing them for the better. Heroes, outstanding individuals, may become 
ridiculous and useless failures if they do not correctly understand 
the conditions of development of society and go counter to the historical 
needs of society in the conceited belief that they are ³makers² of history. 
To this category of ill-starred heroes belonged the Narodniks. 
Plekhanov¹s writings and the fight he waged against the Narodniks 
thoroughly undermined their influence among the revolutionary intelli

15 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
gentsia. But the ideological destruction of Narodism was still far from 
complete. It was left to Lenin to deal the final blow to Narodism, as 
an enemy of Marxism. 
Soon after the suppression of the ³Narodnaya Volya² Party the 
majority of the Narodniks renounced the revolutionary struggle against 
the tsarist government and began to preach a policy of reconciliation 
and agreement with it. In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks began 
to voice the interests of the kulaks. 
The ³Emancipation of Labour² group prepared two drafts of a 
program for a Russian Social-Democratic party (the first in 1884 and 
the second in 1887). This was a very important preparatory step in 
the formation of a Marxist Social-Democratic party in Russia. 
But at the same time the ³Emancipation of Labour² group was 
guilty of some very serious mistakes. Its first draft program still contained 
vestiges of the Narodnik views; it countenanced the tactics of individual 
terrorism. Furthermore, Plekhanov failed to take into account that in 
the course of the revolution the proletariat could and should lead the 
peasantry, and that only in an alliance with the peasantry could the 
proletariat gain the victory over tsardom. Plekhanov further considered 
that the liberal bourgeoisie was a force that could give support, albeit 
unstable support, to the revolution; but as to the peasantry, in some of 
his writings he discounted it entirely, declaring, for instance, that: 
³Apart from the bourgeoisie and the proletariat we perceive no 
social forces in our country in which oppositional or revolutionary 
combinations might find support.² (Plekhanov, Works, Russ. ed., 
Vol. III, p. 119.) 
These erroneous views were the germ of Plekhanov¹s future Menshevik 
views. 
Neither the ³Emancipation of Labour² group nor the Marxist 
circles of that period had yet any practical connections with the workingclass 
movement. It was a period in which the theory of Marxism, the 
ideas of Marxism, and the principles of the Social-Democratic program 
were just appearing and gaining a foothold in Russia. In the decade 
of 1884-94 the Social-Democratic movement still existed in the form of 
small separate groups and circles which had no connections, or very scant 
connections, with the mass working-class movement. Like an infant 
still unborn but already developing in its mother¹s womb, the Social- 
Democratic movement, as Lenin wrote, was in the ³process of foetal 
development.² 
The ³Emancipation of Labor² group, Lenin said, ³only laid the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 16 
theoretical foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and made 
the first step towards the working-class movement.² 
The task of uniting Marxism and the working-class movement in 
Russia, and of correcting the mistakes of the ³Emancipation of Labour² 
group fell to Lenin. 
3. BEGINNING OF LENIN¹S REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES. 
ST. PETERSBURG LEAGUE OF STRUGGLE FOR THE EMANCIPATION 
OF THE WORKING CLASS 
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin), the founder of Bolshevism, was 
born in the city of Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk) in 1870. In 1887 Lenin 
entered the Kazan University, but was soon arrested and expelled from 
the university for taking part in the revolutionary student movement. In 
Kazan Lenin joined a Marxist circle formed by one Fedoseyev. Lenin 
later removed to Samara and soon afterwards the first Marxist circle 
in that city was formed with Lenin as the central figure. Already 
in those days Lenin amazed everyone by his thorough knowledge of 
Marxism. 
At the end of 1893 Lenin removed to St. Petersburg. His very 
first utterances in the Marxist circles of that city made a deep impression 
on their members. His extraordinarily profound knowledge of Marx, 
his ability to apply Marxism to the economic and political situation of 
Russia at that time, his ardent and unshakable belief in the victory of 
the workers¹ cause, and his outstanding talent as an organizer made 
Lenin the acknowledged leader of the St. Petersburg Marxists. 
Lenin enjoyed the warm affection of the politically advanced workers 
whom he taught in the circles. 
³Our lectures,² says the worker Babushkin recalling Lenin¹s teaching 
activities in the workers¹ circles, ³were of a very lively and interesting 
character; we were all very pleased with these lectures and constantly 
admired the wisdom of our lecturer.² 
In 1895 Lenin united all the Marxist workers¹ circles in St. Petersburg 
(there were already about twenty of them) into a single League 
of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. He thus prepared 
the way for the founding of a revolutionary Marxist workers¹ 
party. 
Lenin put before the League of Struggle the task of forming closer 
connections with the mass working-class movement and of giving it 
political leadership. Lenin proposed to pass from the propaganda of

17 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
Marxism among the few politically advanced workers who gathered in 
the propaganda circles to political agitation among the broad masses of 
the working class on issues of the day. This turn towards mass agitation 
was of profound importance for the subsequent development of the 
working-class movement in Russia. 
The nineties were a period of industrial boom. The number of 
workers was increasing. The working-class movement was gaining 
strength. In the period of 1895-99, according to incomplete data, not 
less than 221,000 workers took part in strikes. The working-class movement 
was becoming an important force in the political life of the country. 
The course of events was corroborating the view which the Marxists 
had championed against the Narodniks, namely, that the working class 
was to play the leading role in the revolutionary movement. 
Under Lenin¹s guidance, the League of Struggle for the Emancipation 
of the Working Class linked up the struggle of the workers for 
economic demandsimprovement of working conditions, shorter hours 
and higher wageswith the political struggle against tsardom. The 
League of Struggle educated the workers politically. 
Under Lenin¹s guidance, the St. Petersburg League of Struggle for 
the Emancipation of the Working Class was the first body in Russia 
that began to unite Socialism with the working-class movement. When 
a strike broke out in some factory, the League of Struggle, which 
through the members of its circles was kept well posted on the state of 
affairs in the factories, immediately responded by issuing leaflets and 
Socialist proclamations. These leaflets exposed the oppression of the 
workers by the manufacturers, explained how the workers should fight 
for their interests, and set forth the workers¹ demands. The leaflets told 
the plain truth about the ulcers of capitalism, the poverty of the workers, 
their intolerably hard working day of 12 to 14 hours, and their utter 
lack of rights. They also put forward appropriate political demands. 
With the collaboration of the worker Babushkin, Lenin at the end of 
1894 wrote the first agitational leaflet of this kind and an appeal to the 
workers of the Semyannikov Works in St. Petersburg who were on 
strike. In the autumn of 1895 Lenin wrote a leaflet for the men and 
women strikers of the Thornton Mills. These mills belonged to English 
owners who were making millions in profits out of them. The working 
day in these mills exceeded 14 hours, while the wages of a weaver were 
about 7 rubles per month. The workers won the strike. In a short 
space of time the League of Struggle printed dozens of such leaflets and 
appeals to the workers of various factories. Every leaflet greatly helped

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 18 
to stiffen the spirit of the workers. They saw that the Socialists were 
helping and defending them. 
In the summer of 1896 a strike of 30,000 textile workers, led by 
the League of Struggle, took place in St. Petersburg. The chief demand 
was for shorter hours. This strike forced the tsarist government to pass, 
on June 2, 1897, a law limiting the working day to 11 hours. Prior 
to this the working day was not limited in any way. 
In December 1895 Lenin was arrested by the tsarist government. 
But even in prison he did not discontinue his revolutionary work. He 
assisted the League of Struggle with advice and direction and wrote 
pamphlets and leaflets for it. There he wrote a pamphlet entitled On 
Strikes and a leaflet entitled To the Tsarist Government, exposing its 
savage despotism. There too Lenin drafted a program for the party 
(he used milk as an invisible ink and wrote between the lines of a book 
on medicine). 
The St. Petersburg League of Struggle gave a powerful impetus to 
the amalgamation of the workers¹ circles in other cities and regions of 
Russia into similar leagues. In the middle of the nineties Marxist organizations 
arose in Transcaucasia. In 1894 a Workers¹ Union was formed 
in Moscow. Towards the end of the nineties a Social-Democratic Union 
was formed in Siberia. In the nineties Marxist groups arose in Ivanovo- 
Voznesensk, Yaroslavl and Kostroma and subsequently merged to form 
the Northern Union of the Social-Democratic Party. In the second 
half of the nineties Social-Democratic groups and unions were formed 
in Rostov-on-Don, Ekaterinoslav, Kiev, Nikolayev, Tula, Samara, 
Kazan, Orekhovo-Zuyevo and other cities. 
The importance of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the 
Emancipation of the Working Class consisted in the fact that, as Lenin 
said, it was the first real rudiment of a revolutionary party which was 
backed by the working-class movement. 
Lenin drew on the revolutionary experience of the St. Petersburg 
League of Struggle in his subsequent work of creating a Marxist Social- 
Democratic party in Russia. 
After the arrest of Lenin and his close associates, the leadership of 
the St. Petersburg League of Struggle changed considerably. New people 
appeared who called themselves the ³young² and Lenin and his associates 
the ³old fellows.² These people pursued an erroneous political 
line. They declared that the workers should be called upon to wage 
only an economic struggle against their employers; as for the political 
struggle, that was the affair of the liberal bourgeoisie, to whom the 
leadership of the political struggle should be left.

19 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
These people came to be called ³Economists.² 
They were the first group of compromisers and opportunists within 
the ranks of the Marxist organizations in Russia. 
4. LENIN¹S STRUGGLE AGAINST NARODISM AND ³LEGAL MARXISM.² 
LENIN¹S IDEA OF AN ALLIANCE OF THE WORKING CLASS 
AND THE PEASANTRY. FIRST CONGRESS OF THE RUSSIAN 
SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY 
Although Plekhanov had already in the eighties dealt the chief blow 
to the Narodnik system of views, at the beginning of the nineties Narodnik 
views still found sympathy among certain sections of the revolutionary 
youth. Some of them continued to hold that Russia could avoid 
the capitalist path of development and that the principal role in the revolution 
would be played by the peasantry, and not by the working class. 
The Narodniks that still remained did their utmost to prevent the spread 
of Marxism in Russia, fought the Marxists and endeavoured to discredit 
them in every way. Narodism had to be completely smashed ideologically 
if the further spread of Marxism and the creation of a Social-Democratic 
party were to be assured. 
This task was performed by Lenin. 
In his book, What the ³Friends of the People² Are and How They 
Fight Against the Social-Democrats (1894), Lenin thoroughly exposed 
the true character of the Narodniks, showing that they were false 
³friends of the people² actually working against the people. 
Essentially, the Narodniks of the nineties had long ago renounced 
all revolutionary struggle against the tsarist government. The liberal 
Narodniks preached reconciliation with the tsarist government ³They 
think,² Lenin wrote in reference to the Narodniks of that period, ³that 
if they simply plead with this government nicely enough and humbly 
enough, it will put everything right.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. I, 
p. 413.)* 
The Narodniks of the nineties shut their eyes to the condition of 
the poor peasants, to the class struggle in the countryside, and to the 
exploitation of the poor peasants by the kulaks, and sang praises to the 
development of kulak farming. As a matter of fact they voiced the 
interests of the kulaks. 
* Quotations from English translations of Lenin and Stalin have been checked with 
the original and the translations in some cases revised.Tr.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 20 
At the same time, the Narodniks in their periodicals baited the Marxists. 
They deliberately distorted and falsified the views of the Russian 
Marxists and claimed that the latter desired the ruin of the countryside 
and wanted ³every muzhik to be stewed in the factory kettle.² Lenin 
exposed the falsity of the Narodnik criticism and pointed out that it was 
not a matter of the ³wishes² of the Marxists, but of the fact that capitalism 
was actually developing in Russia and that this development was 
inevitably accompanied by a growth of the proletariat. And the proletariat 
would be the gravedigger of the capitalist system. 
Lenin showed that it was the Marxists and not the Narodniks who 
were the real friends of the people, that it was the Marxists who wanted 
to throw off the capitalist and landlord yoke, to destroy tsardom. 
In his book, What the ³Friends of the People² Are, Lenin for the 
first time advanced the idea of a revolutionary alliance of the workers 
and peasants as the principal means of overthrowing tsardom, the landlords 
and the bourgeoisie. 
In a number of his writings during this period Lenin criticized the 
methods of political struggle employed by the principal Narodnik group, 
the ³Narodnaya Volya,² and later by the successors of the Narodniks, 
the Socialist-Revolutionariesespecially the tactics of individual terrorism. 
Lenin considered these tactics harmful to the revolutionary movement, 
for they substituted the struggle of individual heroes for the 
struggle of the masses. They signified a lack of confidence in the revolutionary 
movement of the people. 
In the book, What the ³Friends of the People² Are, Lenin outlined 
the main tasks of the Russian Marxists. In his opinion, the first duty of 
the Russian Marxists was to weld the disunited Marxist circles into a 
united Socialist workers¹ party. He further pointed out that it would 
be the working class of Russia, in alliance with the peasantry, that would 
overthrow the tsarist autocracy, after which the Russian proletariat, in 
alliance with the labouring and exploited masses, would, along with 
the proletariat of other countries, take the straight road of open political 
struggle to the victorious Communist revolution. 
Thus, over forty years ago, Lenin correctly pointed out to the 
working class its path of struggle, defined its role as the foremost revolutionary 
force in society, and that of the peasantry as the ally of the 
working class. 
The struggle waged by Lenin and his followers against Narodism 
led to the latter¹s complete ideological defeat already in the nineties. 
Of immense significance, too, was Lenin¹s struggle against ³legal 
Marxism.² It usually happens with big social movements in history that

21 I 8 8 3 - I 9 0 I

transient ³fellow-travelers² fasten on them. The ³legal Marxists,² as 
they were called, were such fellow-travelers. Marxism began to spread 
widely throughout Russia; and so we found bourgeois intellectuals decking 
themselves out in a Marxist garb. They published their articles in 
newspapers and periodicals that were legal, that is, allowed by the tsarist 
government. That is why they came to be called ³legal Marxists.² 
After their own fashion, they too fought Narodism. But they tried 
to make use of this fight and of the banner of Marxism in order to 
subordinate and adapt the working-class movement to the interests of 
bourgeois society, to the interests of the bourgeoisie. They cut out the 
very core of Marxism, namely, the doctrine of the proletarian revolution 
and the dictatorship of the proletariat. One prominent legal Marxist, 
Peter Struve, extolled the bourgeoisie, and instead of calling for a revolutionary 
struggle against capitalism, urged that ³we acknowledge our 
lack of culture and go to capitalism for schooling.² 
In the fight against the Narodniks Lenin considered it permissible 
to come to a temporary agreement with the ³legal Marxists² in order 
to use them against the Narodniks, as, for example, for the joint publication 
of a collection of articles directed against the Narodniks. At the same 
time, however, Lenin was unsparing in his criticism of the ³legal Marxists² 
and exposed their liberal bourgeois nature. 
Many of these fellow-travelers later became Constitutional-Democrats 
(the principal party of the Russian bourgeoisie), and during the 
Civil War out-and-out Whiteguards. 
Along with the Leagues of Struggle in St. Petersburg, Moscow, 
Kiev and other places, Social-Democratic organizations arose also in 
the western national border regions of Russia. In the nineties the Marxist 
elements in the Polish nationalist party broke away to form the Social-
Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania. At the end of the 
nineties Latvian Social-Democratic organizations were formed, and in 
October I897 the Jewish General Social-Democratic Unionknown as 
the Bundwas founded in the western provinces of Russia. 
In I898 several of the Leagues of Strugglethose of St. Petersburg, 
Moscow, Kiev and Ekaterinoslavtogether with the Bund made the 
first attempt to unite and form a Social-Democratic party. For this 
purpose they summoned the First Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic 
Labour Party (R.S.D.L.P.), which was held in Minsk in March 
I898. 
The First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. was attended by only nine 
persons. Lenin was not present because at that time he was living in 
exile in Siberia. The Central Committee of the Party elected at the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 22 
congress was very soon arrested. The Manifesto published in the name 
of the congress was in many respects unsatisfactory. It evaded the question 
of the conquest of political power by the proletariat, it made no 
mention of the hegemony of the proletariat, and said nothing about the 
allies of the proletariat in its struggle against tsardom and the bourgeoisie. 
In its decisions and in its Manifesto the congress announced the formation 
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
It is this formal act, which played a great revolutionary propagandist 
role, that constituted the significance of the First Congress of the 
R.S.D.L.P. 
But although the First Congress had been held, in reality no Marxist 
Social-Democratic Party was as yet formed in Russia. The congress 
did not succeed in uniting the separate Marxist circles and organizations 
and welding them together organizationally. There was still no common 
line of action in the work of the local organizations, nor was there 
a party program, party rules or a single leading centre. 
For this and for a number of other reasons, the ideological confusion 
in the local organizations began to increase, and this created 
favourable ground for the growth within the working-class movement 
of the opportunist trend known as ³Economism.² 
It required several years of intense effort on the part of Lenin 
and of Iskra (Spark), the newspaper he founded, before this confusion 
could be overcome, the opportunist vacillations put an end to, and the 
way prepared for the formation of the Russian Social-Democratic 
Labour Party. 
5. LENIN¹S FIGHT AGAINST ³ECONOMISM.² APPEARANCE OF 
LENIN¹S NEWSPAPER ³ISKRA² 
Lenin was not present at the First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. He 
was at that time in exile in Siberia, in the village of Shushenskoye, where 
he had been banished by the tsarist government after a long period of 
imprisonment in St. Petersburg in connection with the prosecution of 
the League of Struggle. 
But Lenin continued his revolutionary activities even while in exile. 
There he finished a highly important scientific work, The Development 
of Capitalism in Russia, which completed the ideological destruction of 
Narodism. There, too, he wrote his well-known pamphlet, The Tasks 
of the Russian Social-Democrats. 
Although Lenin was cut off from direct, practical revolutionary work,

23 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
he nevertheless managed to maintain some connections with those 
engaged in this work; he carried on a correspondence with them from 
exile, obtained information from them and gave them advice. At this 
time Lenin was very much preoccupied with the ³Economists.² He realized 
better than anybody else that ³Economism² was the main nucleus of 
compromise and opportunism, and that if ³Economism² were to gain 
the upper hand in the working-class movement, it would undermine the 
revolutionary movement of the proletariat and lead to the defeat of 
Marxism. 
Lenin therefore started a vigorous attack on the ³Economists² as 
soon as they appeared on the scene. 
The ³Economists² maintained that the workers should engage 
only in the economic struggle; as to the political struggle, that should 
be left to the liberal bourgeoisie, whom the workers should support. 
In Lenin¹s eyes this tenet was a desertion of Marxism, a denial of the 
necessity for an independent political party of the working class, an 
attempt to convert the working class into a political appendage of the 
bourgeoisie. 
In 1899 a group of ³Economists² (Prokopovich, Kuskova and 
others, who later became Constitutional-Democrats) issued a manifesto 
in which they opposed revolutionary Marxism, and insisted that the idea 
of an independent political party of the proletariat and of independent 
political demands by the working class be renounced. The ³Economists² 
held that the political struggle was a matter for the liberal bourgeoisie, 
and that as far as the workers were concerned, the economic struggle 
against the employers was enough for them. 
When Lenin acquainted himself with this opportunist document he 
called a conference of Marxist political exiles living in the vicinity. Seventeen 
of them met and, headed by Lenin, issued a trenchant protest denouncing 
the views of the ³Economists.² 
This protest, which was written by Lenin, was circulated among the 
Marxist organizations all over the country and played an outstanding part 
in the development of Marxist ideas and of the Marxist party in Russia. 
The Russian ³Economists² advocated the same views as the opponents 
of Marxism in the Social-Democratic parties abroad who were 
known as the Bernsteinites, that is, followers of the opportunist Bernstein. 
Lenin¹s struggle against the ³Economists² was therefore at the 
same time a struggle against opportunism on an international scale. 
The fight against ³Economism,² the fight for the creation of an 
independent political party of the proletariat, was chiefly waged by Iskra, 
the illegal newspaper founded by Lenin.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 24 
At the beginning of 1900, Lenin and other members of the League 
of Struggle returned from their Siberian exile to Russia. Lenin conceived 
the idea of founding a big illegal Marxist newspaper on an all-Russian 
scale. The numerous small Marxist circles and organizations which 
already existed in Russia were not yet linked up. At a moment when, 
in the words of Comrade Stalin, ³amateurishness and the parochial outlook 
of the circles were corroding the Party from top to bottom, when 
ideological confusion was the characteristic feature of the internal life 
of the Party,² the creation of an illegal newspaper on an all-Russian 
scale was the chief task of the Russian revolutionary Marxists. Only 
such a newspaper could link up the disunited Marxist organizations and 
prepare the way for the creation of a real party. 
But such a newspaper could not be published in tsarist Russia owing 
to police persecution. Within a month or two at most the tsar¹s sleuths 
would get on its track and smash it. Lenin therefore decided to publish 
the newspaper abroad. There it was printed on very thin but durable 
paper and secretly smuggled into Russia. Some of the issues of Iskra 
were reprinted in Russia by secret printing plants in Baku, Kishinev and 
Siberia. 
In the autumn of 1900 Lenin went abroad to make arrangements 
with the comrades in the ³Emancipation of Labour² group for the 
publication of a political newspaper on an all-Russian scale. The idea 
had been worked out by Lenin in all its details while he was in exile. On 
his way back from exile he had held a number of conferences on the 
subject in Ufa, Pskov, Moscow and St. Petersburg. Everywhere he 
made arrangements with the comrades about codes for secret correspondence, 
addresses to which literature could be sent, and so on, and 
discussed with them plans for the future struggle. 
The tsarist government scented a most dangerous enemy in Lenin. 
Zubatov, an officer of gendarmes in the tsarist Okhrana, expressed the 
opinion in a confidential report that ³there is nobody bigger than Ulyanov 
[Lenin] in the revolution today,² in view of which he considered it 
expedient to have Lenin assassinated. 
Abroad, Lenin came to an arrangement with the ³Emancipation of 
Labour² group, namely, with Plekhanov, Axelrod and V. Zasulich, 
for the publication of Iskra under joint auspices. The whole plan of 
publication from beginning to end had been worked out by Lenin. 
The first issue of Iskra appeared abroad in December 1900. The 
title page bore the epigraph: ³The Spark Will Kindle a Flame.² These 
words were taken from the reply of the Decembrists to the poet Pushkin 
who had sent greetings to them in their place of exile in Siberia.

25 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 0 1 
And indeed, from the spark (Iskra) started by Lenin there subsequently 
flamed up the great revolutionary conflagration in which the 
tsarist monarchy of the landed nobility, and the power of the bourgeoisie 
were reduced to ashes.
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
The Marxist Social-Democratic Labour Party in Russia was formed 
in a struggle waged in the first place against Narodism and its views, 
which were erroneous and harmful to the cause of revolution. 
Only by ideologically shattering the views of the Narodniks was it 
possible to clear the way for a Marxist workers¹ party in Russia. A decisive 
blow to Narodism was dealt by Plekhanov and his ³Emancipation of 
Labour² group in the eighties. 
Lenin completed the ideological defeat of Narodism and dealt it the 
final blow in the nineties. 
The ³Emancipation of Labour² group, founded in 1883, did a 
great deal for the dissemination of Marxism in Russia; it laid the theoretical 
foundations for Social-Democracy and took the first step to establish 
connection with the working-class movement. 
With the development of capitalism in Russia the industrial proletariat 
rapidly grew in numbers. In the middle of the eighties the working 
class adopted the path of organized struggle, of mass action in the 
form of organized strikes. But the Marxist circles and groups only carried 
on propaganda and did not realize the necessity for passing to mass 
agitation among the working class; they therefore still had no practical 
connection with the working-class movement and did not lead it. 
The St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the 
Working Class, which Lenin formed in 1895 and which started mass 
agitation among the workers and led mass strikes, marked a new stage 
the transition to mass agitation among the workers and the union of 
Marxism with the working-class movement. The St. Petersburg League 
of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class was the rudiment 
of a revolutionary proletarian party in Russia. The formation of 
the St. Petersburg League of Struggle was followed by the formation 
of Marxist organizations in all the principal industrial centres as well as 
in the border regions. 
In 1898 at the First Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the first, although 
unsuccessful, attempt was made to unite the Marxist Social-Democratic 
organizations into a party. But this congress did not yet create a party:

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


DISTRIBUTION 
there was neither a party program nor party rules; there was no single 
leading centre, and there was scarcely any connection between the separate 
Marxist circles and groups. 
In order to unite and link together the separate Marxist organizations 
into a single party, Lenin put forward and carried out a plan for 
the founding of Iskra, the first newspaper of the revolutionary Marxists 
on an all-Russian scale. 
The principal opponents to the creation of a single political workingclass 
party at that period were the ³Economists.² They denied the necessity 
for such a party. They fostered the disunity and amateurish methods 
of the separate groups. It was against them that Lenin and the newspaper 
Iskra organized by him directed their blows. 
The appearance of the first issues of Iskra (I900-0I) marked a 
transition to a new perioda period in which a single Russian Social- 
Democratic Labour Party was really formed from the disconnected 
groups and circles.

1. UPSURGE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN RUSSIA IN 
1901-04 
The end of the nineteenth century in Europe was marked by an 
industrial crisis. It soon spread to Russia. During the period of the crisis 
(1900-03) about 3,000 large and small enterprises were closed down 
and over 100,000 workers thrown on the streets. The wages of the 
workers that remained employed were sharply reduced. The insignificant 
concessions previously wrung from the capitalists as the result of 
stubborn economic strikes were now withdrawn. 
Industrial crisis and unemployment did not halt or weaken the working-
class movement. On the contrary, the workers¹ struggle assumed 
an increasingly revolutionary character. From economic strikes, the 
workers passed to political strikes, and finally to demonstrations, put 
forward political demands for democratic liberties, and raised the slogan, 
³Down with the tsarist autocracy!² 
A May Day strike at the Obukhov munitions plant in St. Petersburg 
in 1901 resulted in a bloody encounter between the workers and troops. 
The only weapons the workers could oppose to the armed forces of the 
tsar were stones and lumps of iron. The stubborn resistance of the 
workers was broken. This was followed by savage reprisals: about 800 
workers were arrested, and many were cast into prison or condemned 
to penal servitude and exile. But the heroic ³Obukhov defence² made 
a profound impression on the workers of Russia and called forth a wave 
of sympathy among them. 
In March 1902 big strikes and a demonstration of workers took 
place in Batum, organized by the Batum Social-Democratic Committee. 
The Batum demonstration stirred up the workers and peasants of Transcaucasia. 
27

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 28 
In 1902 a big strike broke out in Rostov-on-Don as well. The first 
to come out were the railwaymen, who were soon joined by the workers 
of many factories. The strike agitated all the workers. As many as 
30,000 would gather at meetings held outside the city limits on several 
successive days. At these meetings Social-Democratic proclamations were 
read aloud and speakers addressed the workers. The police and the 
Cossacks were powerless to disperse these meetings, attended as they 
were by many thousands. When several workers were killed by the 
police, a huge procession of working people attended their funeral on 
the following day. Only by summoning troops from surrounding cities 
was the tsarist government able to suppress the strike. The struggle of 
the Rostov workers was led by the Don Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. 
The strikes that broke out in 1903 were of even larger dimensions. 
Mass political strikes took place that year in the south, sweeping Transcaucasia 
(Baku, Tiflis, Batum) and the large cities of the Ukraine 
(Odessa, Kiev, Ekaterinoslav). The strikes became increasingly stubborn 
and better organized. Unlike earlier actions of the working class, 
the political struggle of the workers was nearly everywhere directed by 
the Social-Democratic committees. 
The working class of Russia was rising to wage a revolutionary 
struggle against the tsarist regime. 
The working-class movement influenced the peasantry. In the spring 
and summer of 1902 a peasant movement broke out in the Ukraine 
(Poltava and Kharkov provinces) and in the Volga region. The peasants 
set fire to landlords¹ mansions, seized their land, and killed the 
detested zemsky nachalniks (rural prefects) and landlords. Troops were 
sent to quell the rebellious peasants. Peasants were shot down, hundreds 
were arrested, and their leaders and organizers were flung into prison, 
but the revolutionary peasant movement continued to grow. 
The revolutionary actions of the workers and peasants indicated that 
revolution was maturing and drawing near in Russia. 
Under the influence of the revolutionary struggle of the workers 
the opposition movement of the students against the government assumed 
greater intensity. In retaliation for the student demonstrations and 
strikes, the government shut down the universities, flung hundreds of 
students into prison, and finally conceived the idea of sending recalcitrant 
students into the army as common soldiers. In response, the students of 
all the universities organized a general strike in the winter of 1901-02. 
About thirty thousand students were involved in this strike. 
The revolutionary movement of the workers and peasants, and

29 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
especially the reprisals against the students, induced also the liberal bourgeois 
and the liberal landlords who sat on what was known as the Zemstvos 
to bestir themselves and to raise their voices in ³protest² against the 
³excesses² of the tsarist government in repressing their student sons. 
The Zemstvo liberals had their stronghold in the Zemstvo boards. 
These were local government bodies which had charge of purely local 
affairs affecting the rural population (building of roads, hospitals and 
schools). The liberal landlords played a fairly prominent part on the Zemstvo 
boards. They were closely associated with the liberal bourgeois, in fact 
were almost merged with them, for they themselves were beginning to 
abandon methods based on survivals of serfdom for capitalist methods of 
farming on their estates, as being more profitable. Of course, both these 
groups of liberals supported the tsarist government; but they were opposed 
to the ³excesses² of tsardom, fearing that these ³excesses² would 
only intensify the revolutionary movement. While they feared the 
³excesses² of tsardom, they feared revolution even more. In protesting 
against these ³excesses,² the liberals pursued two aims: first, to ³bring 
the tsar to his senses,² and secondly, by donning a mask of ³profound 
dissatisfaction² with tsardom, to gain the confidence of the people, and 
to get them, or part of them, to break away from the revolution, and 
thus undermine its strength. 
Of course, the Zemstvo liberal movement offered no menace whatever 
to the existence of tsardom; nevertheless, it served to show that all 
was not well with the ³eternal² pillars of tsardom. 
In 1902 the Zemstvo liberal movement led to the formation of the 
bourgeois ³Liberation² group, the nucleus of the future principal party 
of the bourgeoisie in Russiathe Constitutional-Democratic Party. 
Perceiving that the movement of the workers and peasants was 
sweeping the country in a formidable torrent, the tsarist government did 
everything it could to stem the revolutionary tide. Armed force was 
used with increasing frequency to suppress the workers¹ strikes and demonstrations; 
the bullet and the knout became the government¹s usual 
reply to the actions of the workers and peasants; prisons and places of 
exile were filled to overflowing. 
While tightening up the measures of repression, the tsarist government 
tried at the same time to resort to other, non-repressive and 
more ³flexible,² measures to divert the workers from the revolutionary 
movement. Attempts were made to create bogus workers¹ organizations 
under the ægis of the gendarmes and police. They were dubbed organizations 
of ³police socialism² or Zubatov organizations (after the name

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 30 
of a colonel of gendarmerie, Zubatov, who was the founder of these 
police-controlled workers¹ organizations). Through its agents the 
Okhrana tried to get the workers to believe that the tsarist government 
was itself prepared to assist them in securing the satisfaction of their 
economic demands. ³Why engage in politics, why make a revolution, 
when the tsar himself is on the side of the workers?²Zubatov agents 
would insinuate to the workers. Zubatov organizations were formed in 
several cities. On the model of these organizations and with the same 
purposes in view, an organization known as the Assembly of Russian 
Factory Workers of St. Petersburg was formed in 1904 by a priest by 
the name of Gapon. 
But the attempt of the tsarist Okhrana to gain control over the 
working-class movement failed. The tsarist government proved unable 
by such measures to cope with the growing working-class movement. 
The rising revolutionary movement of the working class swept these 
police-controlled organizations from its path. 
2. LENIN¹S PLAN FOR THE BUILDING OF A MARXIST PARTY. OPPORTUNISM 
OF THE ³ECONOMISTS.² ³ISKRA¹S² FIGHT FOR 
LENIN¹S PLAN. LENIN¹S BOOK ³WHAT IS TO BE DONE?² IDEOLOGICAL 
FOUNDATIONS OF THE MARXIST PARTY 
Notwithstanding the fact that the First Congress of the Russian 
Social-Democratic Party had been held in 1898, and that it had announced 
the formation of the Party, no real party was as yet created. 
There was no party program or party rules. The Central Committee 
of the Party elected at the First Congress was arrested and never replaced, 
for there was nobody to replace it. Worse still, the ideological 
confusion and lack of organizational cohesion of the Party became even 
more marked after the First Congress. 
While the years 1884-94 were a period of victory over Narodism 
and of ideological preparation for the formation of a Social-Democratic 
Party, and the years 1894-98 a period in which an attempt, although 
unsuccessful, was made to weld the separate Marxist organizations into 
a Social-Democratic Party, the period immediately following 1898 was 
one of increased ideological and organizational confusion within the 
Party. The victory gained by the Marxists over Narodism and the revolutionary 
actions of the working class, which proved that the Marxists 
were right, stimulated the sympathy of the revolutionary youth for Marxism. 
Marxism became the fashion. This resulted in an influx into the

31 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
Marxist organizations of throngs of young revolutionary intellectuals, who 
were weak in theory and inexperienced in political organization, and who 
ad only a vague, and for the most part incorrect, idea of Marxism, derived 
from the opportunist writings of the ³legal Marxists² with which 
the press was filled. This resulted in the lowering of the theoretical and 
political standard of the Marxist organizations, in their infection with the 
³legal Marxist² opportunist tendencies, and in the aggravation of ideological 
confusion, political vacillation and organizational chaos. 
The rising tide of the working-class movement and the obvious proximity 
of revolution demanded a united and centralized party of the working 
class which would be capable of leading the revolutionary movement. 
But the local Party organizations, the local committees, groups and circles 
were in such a deplorable state, and their organizational disunity and 
ideological discord so profound, that the task of creating such a party was 
one of immense difficulty. 
The difficulty lay not only in the fact that the Party had to be built 
under the fire of savage persecution by the tsarist government, which 
every now and then robbed the organizations of their finest workers 
whom it condemned to exile, imprisonment and penal servitude, but also 
in the fact that a large number of the local committees and their members 
would have nothing to do with anything but their local, petty 
practical activities, did not realize the harm caused by the absence of organizational 
and ideological unity in the Party, were accustomed to the disunity 
and ideological confusion that prevailed within it, and believed that 
they could get along quite well without a united centralized party. 
If a centralized party was to be created, this backwardness, inertia, 
and narrow outlook of the local bodies had to be overcome. 
But this was not all. There was a fairly large group of people within 
the Party who had their own pressthe Rabochaya Mysl (Workers¹ 
Thought) in Russia and Rabocheye Delo (Workers¹ Cause) abroad 
and who were trying to justify on theoretical grounds the lack of organizational 
cohesion and the ideological confusion within the Party, frequently 
even lauding such a state of affairs, and holding that the plan 
for creating a united and centralized political party of the working class 
was unnecessary and artificial. 
These were the ³Economists² and their followers. 
Before a united political party of the proletariat could be created, 
the ³Economists² had to be defeated. 
It was to this task and to the building of a working-class party that 
Lenin addressed himself. 
How to begin the building of a united party of the working class

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 32 
was a question on which opinions differed. Some thought that the building 
of the Party should be begun by summoning the Second Congress 
of the Party, which would unite the local organizations and create the 
Party. Lenin was opposed to this. He held that before convening a 
congress it was necessary to make the aims and objects of the Party clear, 
to ascertain what sort of a party was wanted, to effect an ideological 
demarcation from the ³Economists,² to tell the Party honestly and 
frankly that there existed two different opinions regarding the aims and 
objects of the Partythe opinion of the ³Economists² and the opinion 
of the revolutionary Social-Democratsto start a wide campaign in the 
press in favour of the views of revolutionary Social-Democracyjust as 
the ³Economists² were conducting a campaign in their own press in 
favour of their own viewsand to give the local organizations the 
opportunity to make a deliberate choice between these two trends. Only 
after this indispensable preliminary work had been done could a Party 
Congress be summoned. 
Lenin put it plainly: 
³Before we can unite, and in order that we may unite, we must 
first of all draw firm and definite lines of demarcation.² (Lenin, 
Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 45.) 
Lenin accordingly held that the building of a political party of the 
working class should be begun by the founding of a militant political 
newspaper on an all-Russian scale, which would carry on propaganda 
and agitation in favour of the views of revolutionary Social-Democracy 
that the establishment of such a newspaper should be the first step in 
the building of the Party. 
In his well-known article, ³Where to Begin?² Lenin outlined a 
concrete plan for the building of the Party, a plan which was later expanded 
in his famous work What is To Be Done? 
³In our opinion,² wrote Lenin in this article, ³the starting point 
of our activities, the first practical step towards creating the organization 
desired,* finally, the main thread following which we would 
be able to develop, deepen and expand that organization unswervingly, 
should be the establishment of a political newspaper on an 
all-Russian scale. . . . Without it we cannot systematically carry on 
that all-embracing propaganda and agitation, consistent in principle, 
which form the chief and constant task of Social-Democrats in general, 
and the particularly urgent task of the present moment when 
* That is, the formation of a party.Ed.

33 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
interest in politics, in questions of Socialism, has been aroused among 
the widest sections of the population.² (Ibid., p. 19.) 
Lenin considered that such a newspaper would serve not only to 
weld the Party ideologically, but also to unite the local bodies within 
the Party organizationally. The network of agents and correspondents 
of the newspaper, representing the local organizations, would provide a 
skeleton around which the Party could be built up organizationally. For, 
Lenin said, ³a newspaper is not only a collective propagandist and collective 
agitator, but also a collective organizer.² 
³This network of agents,² writes Lenin in the same article, 
³will form the skeleton of precisely the organization we need, namely, 
one that is sufficiently large to embrace the whole country, sufficiently 
wide and many-sided to effect a strict and detailed division of labour; 
sufficiently tried and tempered to be able unswervingly to 
carry on its own work under all circumstances, at all turns¹ and in 
all contingencies; sufficiently flexible to be able to avoid open battle 
against an enemy of overwhelming strength, when he has concentrated 
all his forces at one spot, and yet able to take advantage of 
the awkwardness of this enemy and to attack him whenever and 
wherever least expected.² (Ibid., pp. 21-2.) 
Iskra was to be such a newspaper. 
And Iskra did indeed become such a political-newspaper on an all- 
Russian scale which prepared the way for the ideological and organizational 
consolidation of the Party. 
As to the structure and composition of the Party itself, Lenin considered 
that it should consist of two parts: a) a close circle of regular 
cadres of leading Party workers, chiefly professional revolutionaries, that 
is, Party workers free from all occupation except Party work and possessing 
the necessary minimum of theoretical knowledge, political experience, 
organizational practice and the art of combating the tsarist police and of 
eluding them; and b) a broad network of local Party organizations and 
a large number of Party members enjoying the sympathy and support 
of hundreds of thousands of working people. 
³I assert,² Lenin wrote, 1) that no revolutionary movement 
can endure without a stable organization of leaders that maintains 
continuity; 2) that the wider the masses spontaneously drawn into 
the struggle . . . the more urgent the need of such an organization, 
and the more solid this organization must be . . . 3) that such an 
organization must consist chiefly of people professionally engaged

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 34 
in revolutionary activity; 4) that in an autocratic state the more 
we confine the membership of such organization to people who are 
professionally engaged in revolutionary activity and who have been 
professionally trained in the art of combating the political police, the 
more difficult will it be to wipe out such an organization, and 5) 
the greater will be the number of people of the working class and of 
the other classes of society who will be able to join the movement 
and perform active work in it.² (Ibid.) pp. 138-39.) 
As to the character of the Party that was being built up and its role 
in relation to the working class, as well as its aims and objects, Lenin 
held that the Party should form the vanguard of the working class, that 
it should be the guiding force of the working-class movement, co-ordinating 
and directing the class struggle of the proletariat. The ultimate 
goal of the Party was the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment 
of Socialism. Its immediate aim was the overthrow of tsardom and the 
establishment of a democratic order. And inasmuch as the overthrow 
of capitalism was impossible without the preliminary overthrow of tsardom, 
the principal task of the Party at the given moment was to rouse 
the working class and the whole people for a struggle against tsardom, 
to develop a revolutionary movement of the people against it, and to 
overthrow it as the first and serious obstacle in the path of Socialism. 
³History,² Lenin wrote, ³has now confronted us with an immediate 
task which is the most revolutionary of all the immediate 
tasks that confront the proletariat of any country. The fulfilment 
of this task, the destruction of the most powerful bulwark not 
only of European but also (it may now be said) of Asiatic reaction 
would make the Russian proletariat the vanguard of the international 
revolutionary proletariat.² (Ibid., p. 50.) 
And further: 
³We must bear in mind that the struggle with the government 
for partial demands, the winning of partial concessions, are only 
petty skirmishes with the enemy, petty encounters on the outposts, 
whereas the decisive engagement is still to come. Before us, in all 
its strength, stands the enemy¹s fortress, which is raining shot and 
shell upon us and mowing down our best fighters. We must capture 
this fortress; and we shall capture it if we unite all the forces of 
the awakening proletariat with all the forces of the Russian revolutionaries 
into one party, which will attract all that is alive and honest 
in Russia. And only then will the great prophecy of Pyotr Alexeyev, 
the Russian worker revolutionary, be fulfilled: the muscular arm 
of the working millions will be lifted, and the yoke of despotism,

guarded by the soldiers¹ bayonets, will be smashed to atoms!¹² 
(Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. IV, p. 59.) 
Such was Lenin¹s plan for the creation of a party of the working 
class in autocratic tsarist Russia. 
The ³Economists² showed no delay in launching an attack on Lenin¹s 
plan. 
They asserted that the general political struggle against tsardom was 
a matter for all classes, but primarily for the bourgeoisie, and that therefore 
it was of no serious interest to the working class, for the chief 
interest of the workers lay in the economic struggle against the employers 
for higher wages, better working conditions, etc. The primary and immediate 
aim of the Social-Democrats should therefore be not a political 
struggle against tsardom, and not the overthrow of tsardom, but the 
organization of the ³economic struggle of the workers against the employers 
and the government.² By the economic struggle against the 
government they meant a struggle for better factory legislation. The 
³Economists² claimed that in this way it would be possible ³to lend the 
economic struggle itself a political character.² 
The ³Economists² no longer dared openly to contest the need for 
a political party of the working class. But they considered that it 
should not be the guiding force of the working-class movement, that 
it should not interfere in the spontaneous movement of the working 
class, let alone direct it, but that it should follow in the wake of this 
movement, study it and draw lessons from it. 
The ³Economists² furthermore asserted that the role of the conscious 
element in the working-class movement, the organizing and directing 
role of Socialist consciousness and Socialist theory, was insignificant, or 
almost insignificant; that the Social-Democrats should not elevate the 
minds of the workers to the level of Socialist consciousness, but, on 
the contrary, should adjust themselves and descend to the level of the 
average, or even of the more backward sections of the working class, 
and that the Social-Democrats should not try to impart a Socialist consciousness 
to the working class, but should wait until the spontaneous 
movement of the working class arrived of itself at a Socialist consciousness. 
As regards Lenin¹s plan for the organization of the Party, the 
³Economists² regarded it almost as an act of violence against the 
spontaneous movement. 
In the columns of Iskra, and especially in his celebrated work What 
is To Be Done?, Lenin launched a vehement attack against this opportunist 
philosophy of the ³Economists² and demolished it.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 36 
1) Lenin showed that to divert the working class from the general 
political struggle against tsardom and to confine its task to that of the 
economic struggle against the employers and the government, while leaving 
both employers and government intact, meant to condemn the workers 
to eternal slavery. The economic struggle of the workers against the 
employers and the government was a trade union struggle for better 
terms in the sale of their labour power to the capitalists. The workers, 
however, wanted to fight not only for better terms in the sale of their 
labour power to the capitalists, but also for the abolition of the capitalist 
system itself which condemned them to sell their labour power to the 
capitalists and to suffer exploitation. But the workers could not develop 
their struggle against capitalism, their struggle for Socialism to the full, 
as long as the path of the working-class movement was barred by tsardom, 
that watchdog of capitalism. It was therefore the immediate task 
of the Party and of the working class to remove tsardom from the path 
and thus clear the way to Socialism. 
2) Lenin showed that to extol the spontaneous process in the working-
class movement, to deny that the Party had a leading role to play, 
to reduce its role to that of a recorder of events, meant to preach 
khvostism (following in the tail), to preach the conversion of the Party 
into a tall-piece of the spontaneous process, into a passive force of the 
movement, capable only of contemplating the spontaneous process and 
allowing events to take their own course. To advocate this meant working 
for the destruction of the Party, that is, leaving the working class 
without a partythat is, leaving the working class unarmed. But to 
leave the working class unarmed when it was faced by such enemies as 
tsardom, which was armed to the teeth, and the bourgeoisie, which was 
organized on modern lines and had its own party to direct its struggle 
against the working class, meant to betray the working class. 
3) Lenin showed that to bow in worship of the spontaneous workingclass 
movement and to belittle the importance of consciousness, of Socialist 
consciousness and Socialist theory, meant, in the first place, to insult 
the workers, who were drawn to consciousness as to light; in the second 
place, to lower the value of theory in the eyes of the Party, that is, to 
depreciate the instrument which helped the Party to understand the 
present and foresee the future; and, in the third place, it meant to sink 
completely and irrevocably into the bog of opportunism. 
³Without a revolutionary theory,² Lenin said, ³there can be 
no revolutionary movement. . . . The role of vanguard can be fulfilled 
only by a party that is guided by the most advanced theory.² 
(Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. II, pp. 47, 48.)

37 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
4) Lenin showed that the ³Economists² were deceiving the working 
class when they asserted that a Socialist ideology could arise from the 
spontaneous movement of the working class, for in reality the Socialist 
ideology arises not from the spontaneous movement, but from science. 
By denying the necessity of imparting a Socialist consciousness to the 
working class, the ³Economists² were clearing the way for bourgeois 
ideology, facilitating its introduction and dissemination among the working 
class, and, consequently, they were burying the idea of union between 
the working-class movement and Socialism, thus helping the bourgeoisie. 
³All worship of the spontaneity of the labour movement,² Lenin 
said, ³all belittling of the role of the conscious element,¹ of the role 
of the party of Social-Democracy, means, altogether irrespective of 
whether the belittler likes it or not, strengthening the influence of the 
bourgeois ideology among the workers.² (Ibid., p. 61.) 
And further: 
³The only choice is: either the bourgeois or the Socialist ideology. 
There is no middle course. . . . Hence to belittle the Socialist ideology 
in any way, to turn away from it in the slightest degree means 
to strengthen the bourgeois ideology.² (Ibid., p. 62.) 
5) Summing up all these mistakes of the ³Economists,² Lenin came 
to the conclusion that they did not want a party of social revolution 
for the emancipation of the working class from capitalism, but a party of 
³social reform,² which presupposed the preservation of capitalist rule, 
and that, consequently, the ³Economists² were reformists who were betraying 
the fundamental interests of the proletariat. 
6) Lastly, Lenin showed that ³Economism² was not an accidental 
phenomenon in Russia, but that the ³Economists² were an instrument of 
bourgeois influence upon the working class, that they had allies in the 
West-European Social-Democratic parties in the person of the revisionists, 
the followers of the opportunist Bernstein. The opportunist trend in 
Social-Democratic parties was gaining strength in Western Europe; on 
the plea of ³freedom to criticize² Marx, it demanded a ³revision² of the 
Marxist doctrine (hence the term ³revisionism²); it demanded renunciation 
of the revolution, of Socialism and of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. Lenin showed that the Russian ³Economists² were pursuing 
a similar policy of renunciation of the revolutionary struggle, of 
Socialism and of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Such were the main theoretical principles expounded by Lenin in 
What is To Be Done? 
As a result of the wide circulation of this book, by the time of the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 38 
Second Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Party, that is, within 
a year after its publication (it appeared in March 1902), nothing but a 
distasteful memory remained of the ideological stand of ³Economism,² 
and to be called an ³Economist² was regarded by the majority of the 
members of the Party as an insult. 
It was a complete ideological defeat for ³Economism,² for the 
ideology of opportunism, khvostism and spontaneity. 
But this does not exhaust the significance of Lenin¹s What is To 
Be Done? 
The historic significance of this celebrated book lies in the fact that 
in it Lenin: 
1) For the first time in the history of Marxist thought, laid bare 
the ideological roots of opportunism, showing that they principally consisted 
in worshipping the spontaneous working-class movement and belittling 
the role of Socialist consciousness in the working-class movement; 
2) Brought out the great importance of theory, of consciousness, and 
of the Party as a revolutionizing and guiding force of the spontaneous 
working-class movement; 
3) Brilliantly substantiated the fundamental Marxist thesis that a 
Marxist party is a union of the working-class movement with Socialism; 
4) Gave a brilliant exposition of the ideological foundations of a 
Marxist party. 
The theoretical theses expounded in What is To Be Done? later 
became the foundation of the ideology of the Bolshevik Party. 
Possessing such a wealth of theory, Iskra was able to, and actually 
did, develop an extensive campaign for Lenin¹s plan for the building of 
the Party, for mustering its forces, for calling the Second Party Congress, 
for revolutionary Social-Democracy, and against the ³Economists,² 
revisionists, and opportunists of all kinds. 
One of the most important things that Iskra did was to draft a program 
for the Party. The program of a workers¹ party, as we know, is a 
brief, scientifically formulated statement of the aims and objects of the 
struggle of the working class. The program defines both the ultimate 
goal of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat, and the demands 
for which the party fights while on the way to the achievement of the 
ultimate goal. The drafting of a program was therefore a matter of 
prime importance. 
During the drafting of the program serious differences arose on 
the editorial board of Iskra between Lenin, on the one hand, and Plekhanov 
and other members of the board, on the other. These differences 
and disputes almost led to a complete rupture between Lenin and Plekha

39 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
nov. But matters did not come to a head at that time. Lenin secured 
the inclusion in the draft program of a most important clause on the 
dictatorship of the proletariat and of a clear statement on the leading 
role of the working class in the revolution. 
It was Lenin, too, who drew up the whole agrarian section of the 
program. Already at that time Lenin was in favour of the nationalization 
of the land, but he considered it necessary in the first stage of the 
struggle to put forward the demand for the return to the peasants of 
the otrezki, that is, those portions of the land which had been cut off 
the peasants¹ land by the landlords at the time of ³emancipation² of the 
peasants. Plekhanov was opposed to the demand for the nationalization 
of the land. 
The disputes between Lenin and Plekhanov over the Party program 
to some extent determined the future differences between the Bolsheviks 
and the Mensheviks. 
3. SECOND CONGRESS OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC LABOUR 
PARTY. ADOPTION OF PROGRAM AND RULES AND FORMATION 
OF A SINGLE PARTY. DIFFERENCES AT THE CONGRESS 
AND APPEARANCE OF TWO TRENDS WITHIN THE PARTY: THE 
BOLSHEVIK AND THE MENSHEVIK 
Thus the triumph of Lenin¹s principles and the successful struggle 
waged by Iskra for Lenin¹s plan of organization brought about all the 
principal conditions necessary for the creation of a party, or, as it was 
said at the time, of a real party. The Iskra trend gained the upper 
hand among the Social-Democratic organizations in Russia. The Second 
Party Congress could now be summoned. 
The Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. opened on July 17 (30, 
New Style), 1903. It was held abroad, in secret. It first met in Brussels, 
but the Belgian police requested the delegates to leave the country. 
Thereupon the congress transferred its sittings to London. 
Forty-three delegates in all, representing 26 organizations, assembled 
at the congress. Each committee was entitled to send two delegates, but 
some of them sent only one. The 43 delegates commanded 51 votes 
between them. 
The chief purpose of the congress was ³to create a real party on that 
basis of principles and organization which had been advanced and elaborated 
by Iskra.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 412.) 
The composition of the congress was heterogeneous. The avowed

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 40 
³Economists² were not represented, because of the defeat they had suffered. 
But they had since disguised their views so artfully that they 
managed to smuggle several of their delegates into the congress. Moreover, 
the Bund delegates differed only ostensibly from the ³Economists²; 
in reality they supported the ³Economists.² 
Thus the congress was attended not only by supporters of Iskra, but 
also by its adversaries. Thirty-three of the delegates, that is, the majority, 
were supporters of Iskra. But not all those who considered themselves 
Iskra-ists were real Leninist Iskra-ists. The delegates fell into several 
groups. The supporters of Lenin, or the firm Iskra-ists, commanded 24 
votes; nine of the Iskra-ists followed Martov; these were unstable Iskraists. 
Some of the delegates vacillated between Iskra and its opponents; 
they commanded 10 votes and constituted the Centre. The avowed 
opponents of Iskra commanded 8 votes (3 ³Economists² and 5 Bundists). 
A split in the ranks of the Iskra-ists would be enough to give the 
enemies of Iskra the upper hand. 
It will therefore be seen how complex the situation was at the congress. 
Lenin expended a great deal of energy to ensure the victory of 
Iskra. 
The most important item on the agenda was the adoption of the 
Party program. The chief point which, during the discussion of the 
program, aroused the objections of the opportunist section of the congress 
was the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. There were a 
number of other items in the program on which the opportunists did not 
agree with the revolutionary section of the congress. But they decided 
to put up the main fight on the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
on the plea that the programs of a number of foreign Social- 
Democratic parties contained no clause on the dictatorship of the 
proletariat, and that therefore the program of the Russian Social-Democratic 
Party could dispense with it too. 
The opportunists also objected to the inclusion in the Party program 
of demands on the peasant question. These people did not want revolution; 
they, therefore, fought shy of the ally of the working classthe 
peasantryand adopted an unfriendly attitude towards it. 
The Bundists and the Polish Social-Democrats objected to the right 
of nations to self-determination. Lenin had always taught that the 
working class must combat national oppression. To object to the inclusion 
of this demand in the program was tantamount to a proposal to 
renounce proletarian internationalism and to become accomplices in national 
oppression. 
Lenin made short work of all these objections.

41 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
The congress adopted the program proposed by Iskra. 
This program consisted of two parts: a maximum program and a 
minimum program. The maximum program dealt with the principal 
aim of the working-class party, namely, the Socialist revolution, the 
overthrow of the power of the capitalists, and the establishment of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. The minimum program dealt with the 
immediate aims of the Party, aims to be achieved before the overthrow 
of the capitalist system and the establishment of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat, namely, the overthrow of the tsarist autocracy, the establishment 
of a democratic republic, the introduction of an 8-hour working 
day, the abolition of all survivals of serfdom in the countryside, and 
the restoration to the peasants of the cut-off lands (otrezki) of which 
they had been deprived by the landlords. 
Subsequently, the Bolsheviks replaced the demand for the return of 
the otrezki by the demand for the confiscation of all the landed estates. 
The program adopted by the Second Congress was a revolutionary 
program of the party of the working class. 
It remained in force until the Eighth Party Congress, held after the 
victory of the proletarian revolution, when our Party adopted a new 
program. 
Having adopted the program, the Second Party Congress proceeded 
to discuss the draft of the Party Rules. Now that the congress had 
adopted a program and had laid the foundation for the ideological unity 
of the Party, it had also to adopt Party Rules so as to put an end to 
amateurishness and the parochial outlook of the circles, to organizational 
disunity and the absence of strict discipline in the Party. 
The adoption of the program had gone through comparatively 
smoothly, but fierce disputes arose at the congress over the Party Rules. 
The sharpest differences arose over the formulation of the first paragraph 
of the rules, dealing with Party membership. Who could be 
a member of the Party, what was to be the composition of the Party, 
what was to be the organizational nature of the Party, an organized 
whole or something amorphous?such were the questions that arose in 
connection with the first paragraph of the rules. Two different formulations 
contested the ground: Lenin¹s formulation, which was supported 
by Plekhanov and the firm Iskra-ists; and Martov¹s formulation, which 
was supported by Axelrod, Zasulich, the unstable Iskra-ists, Trotsky, and 
all the avowed opportunists at the congress. 
According to Lenin¹s formulation, one could be a member of the 
Party who accepted its program, supported it financially, and belonged 
to one of its organizations. Martov¹s formulation, while admitting that

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 42 
acceptance of the program and financial support of the Party were indispensable 
conditions of Party membership, did not, however, make it 
a condition that a Party member should belong to one of the Party 
organizations, maintaining that a Party member need not necessarily 
belong to a Party organization. 
Lenin regarded the Party as an organized detachment, whose members 
cannot just enrol themselves in the Party, but must be admitted into 
the Party by one of its organizations, and hence must submit to Party 
discipline. Martov, on the other hand, regarded the Party as something 
organizationally amorphous, whose members enrol themselves in the 
Party and are therefore not obliged to submit to Party discipline, inasmuch 
as they do not belong to a Party organization. 
Thus, unlike Lenin¹s formulation, Martov¹s formulation would 
throw the door of the Party wide open to unstable non-proletarian 
elements. On the eve of the bourgeois-democratic revolution there were 
people among the bourgeois intelligentsia who for a while sympathized 
with the revolution. From time to time they might even render some 
small service to the Party. But such people would not join an organization, 
submit to Party discipline, carry out Party tasks and run the accompanying 
risks. Yet Martov and the other Mensheviks proposed to regard 
such people as Party members, and to accord them the right and opportunity 
to influence Party affairs. They even proposed to grant any 
striker the right to ³enrol² himself in the Party, although non-Socialists, 
Anarchists and Socialist-Revolutionaries also took part in strikes. 
And so it was that instead of a monolithic and militant party with 
a clearly defined organization, for which Lenin and the Leninists fought 
at the congress, the Martovites wanted a heterogeneous and loose, amorphous 
party, which could not be a militant party with firm discipline 
because of its heterogeneous character, if for no other reason. 
The breaking away of the unstable Iskra-ists from the firm Iskraists, 
their alliance with the Centrists, joined as they were by the avowed 
opportunists, turned the balance in favour of Martov on this point. By 
28 votes to 22, with one abstention, the congress adopted Martov¹s 
formulation of the first paragraph of the Rules. 
After the split in the ranks of the Iskra-ists over the first paragraph 
of the Rules the struggle at the congress became still more acute. The 
congress was coming to the last item on the agendathe elections of the 
leading institutions of the Party: the editorial board of the central organ 
of the Party (Iskra), and the Central Committee. However, before the 
elections were reached, certain incidents occurred which changed the 
alignment of forces.

43 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
In connection with the Party Rules, the congress had to deal with the 
question of the Bund. The Bund laid claim to a special position within 
the Party. It demanded to be recognized as the sole representative of the 
Jewish workers in Russia. To comply with this demand would have 
meant to divide the workers in the Party organizations according to 
nationality, and to renounce common territorial class organizations of the 
workers. The congress rejected the system of organization on national 
lines proposed by the Bund. Thereupon the Bundists quit the congress. 
Two ³Economists² also left the congress when the latter refused to 
recognize their Foreign League as the representative of the Party abroad. 
The departure of these seven opportunists altered the balance of 
forces at the congress in favour of the Leninists. 
From the very outset Lenin focussed his attention on the composition 
of the central institutions of the Party. He deemed it necessary that the 
Central Committee should be composed of staunch and consistent revolutionaries. 
The Martovites strove to secure the predominance of unstable, 
opportunist elements on the Central Committee. The majority of the 
congress supported Lenin on this question. The Central Committee that 
was elected consisted of Lenin¹s followers. 
On Lenin¹s proposal, Lenin, Plekhanov and Martov were elected to 
the editorial board of Iskra. Martov had demanded the election of all 
the six former members of the Iskra editorial board, the majority of 
whom were Martov¹s followers. This demand was rejected by the 
majority of the congress. The three proposed by Lenin were elected. 
Martov thereupon announced that he would not join the editorial board 
of the central organ. 
Thus, by its vote on the central institutions of the Party, the congress 
sealed the defeat of Martov¹s followers and the victory of Lenin¹s 
followers. 
From that time on, Lenin¹s followers, who received the majority 
of votes in the elections at the congress, have been called Bolsheviks (from 
bolshinstvo, majority), and Lenin¹s opponents, who received the minority 
of votes, have been called Mensheviks (from menshinstvo, minority). 
Summing up the work of the Second Congress, the following conclusions 
may be drawn: 
1) The congress sealed the victory of Marxism over ³Economism,² 
over open opportunism. 
2) The congress adopted a Program and Rules, created the Social- 
Democratic Party, and thus built the framework of a single party. 
3) The congress revealed the existence of grave differences over 
questions of organization which divided the Party into two sections, the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 44 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, of whom the former championed the 
organizational principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy, while the 
latter sank into the bog of organizational looseness and of opportunism. 
4) The congress showed that the place of the old opportunists, the 
³Economists,² who had already been defeated by the Party, was being 
taken by new opportunists, the Mensheviks. 
5) The congress did not prove equal to its task in matters of organization, 
showed vacillation, and at times even gave the preponderance to 
the Mensheviks; and although it corrected its position towards the end, 
it was nevertheless unable to expose the opportunism of the Mensheviks 
on matters of organization and to isolate them in the Party, or even to 
put such a task before the Party. 
This latter circumstance proved one of the main reasons why the 
struggle between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, far from subsiding 
after the congress, became even more acute. 
4. SPLITTING ACTIVITIES OF THE MENSHEVIK LEADERS AND 
SHARPENING OF THE STRUGGLE WITHIN THE PARTY AFTER 
THE SECOND CONGRESS. OPPORTUNISM OF THE MENSHEVIKS. 
LENIN¹S BOOK ³ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK.² ORGANIZATIONAL 
PRINCIPLES OF THE MARXIST PARTY 
After the Second Congress the struggle within the Party became 
even more acute. The Mensheviks did their utmost to frustrate the decisions 
of the Second Congress and to seize the central institutions of the 
Party. They demanded that their representatives be included in the 
editorial board of Iskra and in the Central Committee in such numbers 
as would give them a majority on the editorial board and parity with 
the Bolsheviks on the Central Committee. As this ran directly counter 
to the decisions of the Second Congress, the Bolsheviks rejected the Menshevik¹s 
demand. Thereupon the Mensheviks, secretly from the Party, 
created their own anti-Party factional organization, headed by Martov, 
Trotsky and Axelrod, and, as Martov wrote, ³broke into revolt against 
Leninism.² The methods they adopted for combating the Party were, 
as Lenin expressed it, ³to disorganize the whole Party work, damage the 
cause, and hamper all and everything.² They entrenched themselves 
in the Foreign League of Russian Social-Democrats, nine-tenths of 
whom were émigré intellectuals isolated from the work in Russia, and 
from this position they opened fire on the Party, on Lenin and the 
Leninists.

45 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
The Mensheviks received considerable help from Plekhanov. At 
the Second Congress Plekhanov sided with Lenin. But after the Second 
Congress he allowed the Mensheviks to intimidate him with threats of 
a split. He decided to ³make peace² with the Mensheviks at all costs. 
It was the deadweight of his earlier opportunist mistakes that dragged 
Plekhanov down to the Mensheviks. From an advocate of reconciliation 
with the opportunist Mensheviks he soon became a Menshevik himself. 
Plekhanov demanded that all the former Menshevik editors of the Iskra 
who had been rejected by the congress be included in the editorial board. 
Lenin, of course, could not agree to this and resigned from the Iskra 
editorial board in order to entrench himself in the Central Committee 
of the Party and to strike at the opportunists from this position. Acting 
by himself, and in defiance of the will of the congress, Plekhanov 
co-opted the former Menshevik editors to the editorial board of Iskra. 
From that moment on, beginning with the 52nd issue of Iskra, the Mensheviks 
converted it into their own organ and began to propagate their 
opportunist views in its columns. 
Ever since then Lenin¹s Bolshevik Iskra has been known in the Party 
as the old Iskra, and the Menshevik, opportunist Iskra as the new Iskra. 
When it passed into the hands of the Mensheviks, Iskra became a 
weapon in the fight against Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and an organ for 
the propaganda of Menshevik opportunism, primarily on questions of 
organization. Joining forces with the ³Economists² and the Bundists, 
the Mensheviks started a campaign in the columns of Iskra, as they 
said, against Leninism. Plekhanov could not stick to his position as an 
advocate of conciliation, and soon he too joined the campaign. This was 
bound to happen by the very logic of things: whoever insists on a conciliatory 
attitude towards opportunists is bound to sink to opportunism himself. 
There began to flow from the columns of the new Iskra, as from 
a cornucopia, articles and statements claiming that the Party ought not 
to be an organized whole; that free groups and individuals should be 
allowed within its ranks without any obligation to submit to the decisions 
of its organs; that every intellectual who sympathized with the Party, as 
well as ³every striker² and ³every participant in a demonstration,² should 
be allowed to declare himself a Party member; that the demand for 
obedience to all the decisions of the Party was ³formal and bureaucratic²; 
that the demand that the minority must submit to the majority meant 
the ³mechanical suppression² of the will of Party members; that the 
demand that all Party membersboth leaders and rank-and-filers 
should equally observe Party discipline meant establishing ³serfdom² 
within the Party; that what ³we² needed in the Party was not central

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 46 
ism but anarchist ³autonomism² which would permit individuals and 
Party organizations not to obey the decisions of the Party. 
This was unbridled propaganda of organizational license, which 
would undermine the Party principle and Party discipline; it was glorification 
of the individualism of the intelligentsia, and a justification of 
the anarchist contempt of discipline. 
The Mensheviks were obviously trying to drag the Party back from 
the Second Congress to the old organizational disunity, to the old parochial 
outlook of the circles and the old amateurish methods. 
A vigorous rebuff had to be given the Mensheviks. 
This rebuff was administered by Lenin in his celebrated book, One 
Step Forward, Two Steps Back, published in May 1904. 
The following are the main organizational principles which Lenin 
expounded in his book, and which afterwards came to form the organizational 
foundations of the Bolshevik Party. 
1) The Marxist Party is a part, a detachment, of the working class. 
But the working class has many detachments, and hence not every detachment 
of the working class can be called a party of the working class. 
The Party differs from other detachments of the working class primarily 
by the fact that it is not an ordinary detachment, but the vanguard d etachment, 
a class-conscious detachment, a Marxist detachment of the 
working class, armed with a knowledge of the life of society, of the laws 
of its development and of the laws of the class struggle, and for this 
reason able to lead the working class and to direct its struggle. The 
Party must therefore not be confused with the working class, as the 
part must not be confused with the whole. One cannot demand that 
every striker be allowed to call himself a member of the Party, for 
whoever confuses Party and class lowers the level of consciousness of 
the Party to that of ³every striker,² destroys the Party as the classconscious 
vanguard of the working class. It is not the task of the Party 
to lower its level to that of ³every striker,² but to elevate the masses of 
the workers, to elevate ³every striker² to the level of the Party. 
³We are the party of a class,² Lenin wrote, ³and therefore almost 
the entire class (and in times of war, in the period of civil war, 
the entire class) should act under the leadership of our Party, should 
adhere to our Party as closely as possible. But it would be Manilovism 
(smug complacency) and khvostism¹ (following in the tail) to 
think that at any time under capitalism the entire class, or almost the 
entire class, would be able to rise to the level of consciousness and 
activity of its vanguard, of its Social-Democratic Party. No sensible 
Social-Democrat has ever yet doubted that under capitalism even the

47 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
trade union organizations (which are more primitive and more comprehensible 
to the undeveloped strata) are unable to embrace the 
entire, or almost the entire working class. To forget the distinction 
between the vanguard and the whole of the masses which gravitate 
towards it, to forget the constant duty of the vanguard to raise ever 
wider strata to this most advanced level, means merely to deceive 
oneself, to shut one¹s eyes to the immensity of our tasks, and to 
narrow down these tasks.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., 
Vol. VI, pp. 205-06.) 
2) The Party is not only the vanguard, the class-conscious detachment 
of the working class, but also an organized detachment of the 
working class, with its own discipline, which is binding on its members. 
Hence Party members must necessarily be members of some organization 
of the Party. If the Party were not an organized detachment of the 
class, not a system of organization, but a mere agglomeration of persons 
who declare themselves to be Party members but do not belong to any 
Party organization and therefore are not organized, hence not obliged to 
obey Party decisions, the Party would never have a united will, it could 
never achieve the united action of its members, and, consequently, it 
would be unable to direct the struggle of the working class. The Party 
can lead the practical struggle of the working class and direct it towards 
one aim only if all its members are organized in one common detachment, 
welded together by unity of will, unity of action and unity of discipline. 
The objection raised by the Mensheviks that in that case many 
intellectualsfor example, professors, university and high school students, 
etc.would remain outside the ranks of the Party, since they would not 
want to join any of the organizations of the Party, either because they 
shrink from Party discipline, or, as Plekhanov said at the Second Congress, 
because they consider it ³beneath their dignity to join some local 
organization²this Menshevik objection recoiled on the heads of the 
Mensheviks themselves; for the Party does not need members who shrink 
from Party discipline and fear to join the Party organization. Workers 
did not fear discipline and organization, and they willingly join the organization 
if they have made up their minds to be Party members. It is the 
individualistic intellectuals who fear discipline and organization, and they 
would indeed remain outside the ranks of the Party. But that was all to 
the good, for the Party would be spared that influx of unstable elements, 
which had become particularly marked at that time, when the bourgeois 
democratic revolution was on the upgrade. 
³When I say,² Lenin wrote, ³that the Party should be a sum 
(and not a mere arithmetical sum, but a complex) of organizations

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 48 
. . . I thereby express clearly and precisely my wish, my demand, 
that the Party, as the vanguard of the class, should be as organized 
as possible, that the Party should admit to its ranks only such elements 
as lend themselves to at least a minimum of organization. . . .² 
(Ibid., p. 203.) 
And further: 
³Martov¹s formulation ostensibly defends the interests of the 
broad strata of the proletariat, but in fact, it serves the interests of the 
bourgeois intellectuals, who fight shy of proletarian discipline and 
organization. No one will undertake to deny that it is precisely its 
individualism and incapacity for discipline and organization that in 
general distinguish the intelligentsia as a separate stratum of modern 
capitalist society.² (Ibid., p. 212.) 
And again: 
³The proletariat is not afraid of organization and discipline. . . . 
The proletariat will do nothing to have the worthy professors 
and high school students, who do not want to join an organization, 
recognized as Party members merely because they work under the 
control of an organization. . . . It is not the proletariat, but certain 
intellectuals in our Party who lack self-training in the spirit of organization 
and discipline.² (Ibid., p. 307.) 
3) The Party is not merely an organized detachment, but ³the 
highest of all forms of organization² of the working class, and it is its 
mission to guide all the other organizations of the working class. As the 
highest form of organization, consisting of the finest members of the 
class, armed with an advanced theory, with knowledge of the laws of 
the class struggle and with the experience of the revolutionary movement, 
the Party has every opportunity of guidingand is obliged to guideall 
the other organizations of the working class. The attempt of the Mensheviks 
to belittle and depreciate the leading role of the Party tends to 
weaken all the other organizations of the proletariat which are guided by 
the Party, and, consequently, to weaken and disarm the proletariat, for 
³in its struggle for power the proletariat has no other weapon but organization.² 
(Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 466.) 
4) The Party is an embodiment of the connection of the vanguard 
of the working class with the working class millions. However fine a 
vanguard the Party may be, and however well it may be organized, it 
cannot exist and develop without connections with the non-Party masses, 
and without multiplying and strengthening these connections. A party

49 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
which shuts itself up in its own shell, isolates itself from the masses, and 
loses, or even relaxes, its connections with its class is bound to lose the 
confidence and support of the masses, and, consequently, is surely bound 
to perish. In order to live to the full and to develop, the Party must 
multiply its connections with the masses and win the confidence of the 
millions of its class. 
³In order to be a Social-Democratic party,² Lenin said, ³we 
must win the support precisely of the class.² (Lenin, Collected 
Works, Russ. ed., Vol. VI, p. 208.) 
5) In order to function properly and to guide the masses systematically, 
the Party must be organized on the principle of centralism, 
having one set of rules and uniform Party discipline, one leading organ 
the Party Congress, and in the intervals between congressesthe Central 
Committee of the Party; the minority must submit to the majority, the 
various organizations must submit to the centre, and lower organizations 
to higher organizations. Falling these conditions, the party of the working 
class cannot be a real party and cannot carry out its tasks in guiding 
the class. 
Of course, as under the tsarist autocracy the Party existed illegally 
the Party organizations could not in those days be built up on the principle 
of election from below, and as a consequence, the Party had to be 
strictly conspiratorial. But Lenin considered that this temporary feature 
in the life of our Party would at once lapse with the elimination of tsardom, 
when the Party would become open and legal, and the Party 
organizations would be built up on the principles of democratic elections, 
of democratic centralism. 
³Formerly,² Lenin wrote, ³our Party was not a formally organized 
whole, but only the sum of separate groups, and, therefore, no 
other relations except those of ideological influence were possible between 
these groups. Now we have become an organized Party, and 
this implies the establishment of authority, the transformation of the 
power of ideas into the power of authority, the subordination of lower 
Party bodies to higher Party bodies.² (Ibid., p. 291.) 
Accusing the Mensheviks of organizational nihilism and of aristocratic 
anarchism which would not submit to the authority of the Party 
and its discipline, Lenin wrote: 
³This aristocratic anarchism is particularly characteristic of the 
Russian nihilist. He thinks of the Party organization as a monstrous 
factory¹; he regards the subordination of the part to the whole and 
of the minority to the majority as serfdom¹ . . . division of labour

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 50 
under the direction of a centre evokes from him a tragi-comical outcry 
against people being transformed into wheels and cogs¹ (to turn 
editors into contributors being considered a particularly atrocious 
species of such transformation); mention of the organizational rules 
of the Party calls forth a contemptuous grimace and the disdainful 
remark (intended for the formalists¹) that one could very well 
dispense with rules altogether.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. II, 
pp. 442-43.) 
6) In its practical work, if it wants to preserve the unity of its ranks, 
the Party must impose a common proletarian discipline, equally binding 
on all Party members, both leaders and rank-and-file. Therefore there 
should be no division within the Party into the ³chosen few,² on whom 
discipline is not binding, and the ³many,² on whom discipline is binding. 
If this condition is not observed, the integrity of the Party and the unity 
of its ranks cannot be maintained. 
³The complete absence of sensible arguments on the part of Martov 
and Co. against the editorial board appointed by the congress,² 
Lenin wrote, ³is best of all shown by their own catchword: We 
are not serfs!¹ . . . The mentality of the bourgeois intellectual, 
who regards himself as one of the chosen few¹ standing above mass 
organization and mass discipline, is expressed here with remarkable 
clarity. . . . It seems to the individualism of the intelligentsia . . . 
that all proletarian organization and discipline is serfdom.² (Lenin, 
Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. VI, p. 282.) 
And further: 
³As we proceed with the building of a real party, the classconscious 
worker must learn to distinguish the mentality of the 
soldier of the proletarian army from the mentality of the bourgeois 
intellectual who makes a display of anarchist phraseology, he must 
learn to demand that the duties of a Party member be fulfilled not 
only by the rank-and-filers, but by the people at the top¹ as well.² 
(Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. II, pp. 445-46.) 
Summing up his analysis of the differences, and defining the position 
of the Mensheviks as ³opportunism in matters of organization,² Lenin 
considered that one of the gravest sins of Menshevism lay in its underestimation 
of the importance of party organization as a weapon of the 
proletariat in the struggle for its emancipation. The Mensheviks held 
that the party organization of the proletariat was of no great importance 
for the victory of the revolution. Contrary to the Mensheviks, Lenin

51 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
held that the ideological unity of the proletariat alone was not enough 
for victory; if victory was to be won, ideological unity would have to be 
³consolidated² by the ³material unity of organization² of the proletariat. 
Only on this condition, Lenin considered, could the proletariat become 
an invincible force. 
³In its struggle for power,² Lenin wrote, ³the proletariat has 
no other weapon but organization. Disunited by the rule of anarchic 
competition in the bourgeois world, ground down by forced labour 
for capital, constantly thrust back to the lower depths¹ of utter destitution, 
savagery and degeneration, the proletariat can become, and 
inevitably will become, an invincible force only when its ideological 
unification by the principles of Marxism is consolidated by the material 
unity of an organization which will weld millions of toilers into 
an army of the working class. Neither the decrepit rule of Russian 
tsardom, nor the senile rule of international capital will be able to 
withstand this army.² (Ibid., p. 466.) 
With these prophetic words Lenin concludes his book. 
Such were the fundamental organizational principles set forth by 
Lenin in his famous book, One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. 
The importance of this book lies primarily in the fact that it successfully 
upheld the Party principle against the circle principle, and the Party 
against the disorganizers; that it smashed the opportunism of the Mensheviks 
on questions of organization, and laid the organizational foundations 
of the Bolshevik Party. 
But this does not exhaust its significance. Its historic significance lies 
in the fact that in it Lenin, for the first time in the history of Marxism, 
elaborated the doctrine of the Party as the leading organization of the 
proletariat, as the principal weapon of the proletariat, without which the 
struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be won. 
The circulation of Lenin¹s book, One Step Forward, Two Steps 
Back, among the Party workers led the majority of the local organizations 
to rally to the side of Lenin. 
But the more closely the organizations rallied around the Bolsheviks, 
the more malicious became the behaviour of the Menshevik leaders. 
In the summer of 1904, thanks to Plekhanov¹s assistance and the 
treachery of Krassin and Noskov, two demoralized Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks 
captured the majority on the Central Committee. It was obvious 
that the Mensheviks were working for a split. The loss of Iskra and 
of the Central Committee put the Bolsheviks in a difficult position. It 
became necessary for them to organize their own Bolshevik newspaper.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 52 
It became necessary to make arrangements for a new Party congress, 
the Third Congress, so as to set up a new Central Committee and to 
settle accounts with the Mensheviks. 
And this is what the Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin, set to work to do. 
The Bolsheviks started a campaign for the summoning of the Third 
Party Congress. In August 1904, under Lenin¹s guidance, a conference 
of twenty-two Bolsheviks was held in Switzerland. The conference 
adopted an appeal addressed ³To the Party.² This appeal served the 
Bolsheviks as a program in their struggle for the summoning of the Third 
Congress. 
At three regional conferences of Bolshevik Committees (Southern, 
Caucasian and Northern), a Bureau of Committees of the Majority was 
elected, which undertook the practical preparations for the Third Party 
Congress. 
On January 4, 1905, the first issue of the Bolshevik newspaper 
Vperyod (Forward) appeared. 
Thus two separate groups arose within the Party, the Bolsheviks and 
the Mensheviks, each with its own central body and its own press. 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
In the period 1901-04, with the growth of the revolutionary working-
class movement, the Marxist Social-Democratic organizations in 
Russia grew and gained strength. In the stubborn struggle over principles, 
waged against the ³Economists,² the revolutionary line of Lenin¹s 
Iskra gained the victory, and the ideological confusion and ³amateurish 
methods of work² were overcome. 
Iskra linked up the scattered Social-Democratic circles and groups 
and prepared the way for the convocation of the Second Party Congress. 
At the Second Congress, held in 1903, the Russian Social-Democratic 
Labour Party was formed, a Party Program and Rules were adopted, 
and the central leading organs of the Party were set up. 
In the struggle waged at the Second Congress for the complete 
victory of the Iskra trend in the R.S.D.L.P. there emerged two groups 
the Bolshevik group and the Menshevik group. 
The chief differences between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks 
after the Second Congress centred round questions of organization. 
The Mensheviks drew closer to the ³Economists² and took their 
place within the Party. For the time being the opportunism of the 
Mensheviks revealed itself in questions of organization. The Mensheviks

53 1 9 0 1 - 1 9 0 4 
were opposed to a militant revolutionary party of the type advocated by 
Lenin. They wanted a loose, unorganized, khvostist party. They worked 
to split the ranks of the Party. With Plekhanov¹s help, they seized Iskra 
and the Central Committee, and used these central organs for their own 
purposesto split the Party. 
Seeing that the Mensheviks were threatening a split, the Bolsheviks 
adopted measures to curb the splitters; they mustered the local organizations 
to back the convocation of a Third Congress, and they started their 
own newspaper, Vperyod. 
Thus, on the eve of the first Russian revolution, when the Russo- 
Japanese war had already begun, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks 
acted as two separate political groups.

THE REVOLUTION 
At the end of the nineteenth century the imperialist states began an 
intense struggle for mastery of the Pacific and for the partition of China. 
Tsarist Russia, too, took part in this struggle. In 1900, tsarist troops 
together with Japanese, German, British and French troops suppressed 
with unparalleled cruelty an uprising of the Chinese people directed 
against the foreign imperialists. Even before this the tsarist government 
had compelled China to surrender to Russia the Liaotung Peninsula with 
the fortress of Port Arthur. Russia secured the right to build railways 
on Chinese territory. A railway was built in Northern Manchuriathe 
Chinese-Eastern Railwayand Russian troops were stationed there to 
protect it. Northern Manchuria fell under the military occupation of 
tsarist Russia. Tsardom was advancing towards Korea. The Russian 
bourgeoisie was making plans for founding a ³Yellow Russia² in Manchuria. 
Its annexations in the Far East brought tsardom into conflict with 
another marauder, Japan, which had rapidly become an imperialist country 
and was also bent on annexing territories on the Asiatic continent, in 
the first place at the expense of China. Like tsarist Russia, Japan was 
striving to lay her hands on Korea and Manchuria. Already at that time 
Japan dreamed of seizing Sakhalin and the Russian Far East. Great 
Britain, who feared the growing strength of tsarist Russia in the Far 
East, secretly sided with Japan. War between Russia and Japan was 
brewing. The tsarist government was pushed to this war by the big 
bourgeoisie, which was seeking new markets, and by the more reactionary 
sections of the landlord class. 
54

55 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
Without waiting for the tsarist government to declare war, Japan 
started hostilities herself. She had a good espionage service in Russia 
and anticipated that her foe would be unprepared for the struggle. In 
January 1904, without declaring war, Japan suddenly attacked the 
Russian fortress of Port Arthur and inflicted heavy losses on the Russian 
fleet lying in the harbour. 
That is how the Russo-Japanese War began. 
The tsarist government reckoned that the war would help to 
strengthen its political position and to check the revolution. But it miscalculated. 
The tsarist regime was shaken more than ever by the war. 
Poorly armed and trained, and commanded by incompetent and corrupt 
generals, the Russian army suffered defeat after defeat. 
Capitalists, government officials and generals grew rich on the war. 
Peculation was rampant. The troops were poorly supplied. When the 
army was short of ammunition, it would receive, as if in derision, carloads 
of icons. The soldiers said bitterly: ³The Japanese are giving it to 
us with shells; we¹re to give it to them with icons.² Special trains, instead 
of being used to evacuate the wounded, were loaded with property 
looted by the tsarist generals. 
The Japanese besieged and subsequently captured Port Arthur. After 
inflicting a number of defeats on the tsarist army, they finally routed it 
near Mukden. In this battle the tsarist army of 300,000 men lost about 
120,000 men, killed, wounded or taken prisoner. This was followed 
by the utter defeat and destruction in the Straits of Tsushima of the 
tsarist fleet dispatched from the Baltic to relieve Port Arthur. The defeat 
at Tsushima was disastrous: of the twenty warships dispatched by the 
tsar, thirteen were sunk or destroyed and four captured. Tsarist Russia 
had definitely lost the war. 
The tsarist government was compelled to conclude an ignominious 
peace with Japan. Japan seized Korea and deprived Russia of Port 
Arthur and of half the Island of Sakhalin. 
The people had not wanted the war and realized how harmful it 
would be for the country. They paid heavily for the backwardness of 
tsarist Russia. 
The Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks adopted different attitudes towards 
the war. 
The Mensheviks, including Trotsky, were sinking to a position of 
defending the ³fatherland² of the tsar, the landlords and the capitalists. 
The Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin, on the other hand, held that the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 56 
defeat of the tsarist government in this predatory war would be useful, 
as it would weaken tsardom and strengthen the revolution. 
The defeats of the tsarist armies opened the eyes of the masses to the 
rottenness of tsardom. Their hatred for the tsarist regime grew daily 
more intense. The fall of Port Arthur meant the beginning of the fall 
of the autocracy, Lenin wrote. 
The tsar wanted to use the war to stifle the revolution. He achieved 
the very opposite. The Russo-Japanese War hastened the outbreak of 
the revolution. 
In tsarist Russia the capitalist yoke was aggravated by the yoke of 
tsardom. The workers not only suffered from capitalist exploitation, 
from inhuman toil, but, in common with the whole people, suffered from 
a lack of all rights. The politically advanced workers therefore strove to 
lead the revolutionary movement of all the democratic elements in town 
and country against tsardom. The peasants were in dire need owing 
to lack of land and the numerous survivals of serfdom, and lived in a 
state of bondage to the landlords and kulaks. The nations inhabiting 
tsarist Russia groaned beneath a double yokethat of their own landlords 
and capitalists and that of the Russian landlords and capitalists. 
The economic crisis of 1900-03 had aggravated the hardships of the 
toiling masses; the war intensified them still further. The war defeats 
added fuel to the hatred of the masses for tsardom. The patience of 
the people was coming to an end. 
As we see, there were grounds enough and to spare for revolution. 
In December 1904 a huge and well-organized strike of workers 
took place in Baku, led by the Baku Committee of the Bolsheviks. The 
strike ended in a victory for the workers and a collective agreement was 
concluded between the oilfield workers and owners, the first of its kind 
in the history of the working-class movement in Russia. 
The Baku strike marked the beginning of a revolutionary rise in 
Transcaucasia and in various parts of Russia. 
³The Baku strike was the signal for the glorious actions in 
January and February all over Russia.² (Stalin.) 
This strike was like a clap of thunder heralding a great revolutionary 
storm. 
The revolutionary storm broke with the events of January 9 (22, 
New Style), 1905, in St. Petersburg. 
On January 3, 1905, a strike began at the biggest of the St. Petersburg 
plants, the Putilov (now the Kirov) Works. The strike was 
caused by the dismissal of four workers. It grew rapidly and was joined

57 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
by other St. Petersburg mills and factories. The strike became general. 
The movement grew formidable. The tsarist government decided to 
crush it while it was still in its earliest phase. 
In 1904, prior to the Putilov strike, the police had used the services 
of an agent-provocateur, a priest by the name of Gapon, to form an organization 
of the workers known as the Assembly of Russian Factory 
Workers. This organization had its branches in all the districts of St. 
Petersburg. When the strike broke out the priest Gapon at the meetings 
of his society put forward a treacherous plan: all the workers were to 
gather on January 9 and, carrying church banners and portraits of the 
tsar, to march in peaceful procession to the Winter Palace and present a 
petition to the tsar stating their needs. The tsar would appear before the 
people, listen to them and satisfy their demands. Gapon undertook to 
assist the tsarist Okhrana by providing a pretext for firing on the workers 
and drowning the working-class movement in blood. But this police plot 
recoiled on the head of the tsarist government. 
The petition was discussed at workers¹ meetings where amendments 
were made. Bolsheviks spoke at these meetings without openly announcing 
themselves as such. Under their influence, the petition was supplemented 
by demands for freedom of the press, freedom of speech, 
freedom of association for the workers, the convocation of a Constituent 
Assembly for the purpose of changing the political system of Russia, 
equality of all before the law, separation of church from the state, termination 
of the war, an 8-hour working day, and the handing over of 
the land to the peasants. 
At these meetings the Bolsheviks explained to the workers that 
liberty could not be obtained by petitions to the tsar, but would have 
to be won by force of arms. The Bolsheviks warned the workers that 
they would be fired upon. But they were unable to prevent the procession 
to the Winter Palace. A large part of the workers still believed that the 
tsar would help them. The movement had taken a strong hold on the 
masses. 
The petition of the St. Petersburg workers stated: 
³We, the workingmen of St. Petersburg, our wives, our children 
and our helpless old parents, have come to Thee, our Sovereign, to 
seek truth and protection. We are poverty-stricken, we are oppressed, 
we are burdened with unendurable toil; we suffer humiliation and 
are not treated like human beings. . . . We have suffered in patience, 
but we are being driven deeper and deeper into the slough of poverty, 
lack of rights and ignorance; we are being strangled by despotism

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 58 
and tyranny. . . . Our patience is exhausted. The dreaded moment 
has arrived when we would rather die than bear these intolerable 
sufferings any longer. . . .² 
Early in the morning of January 9, 1905, the workers marched to 
the Winter Palace where the tsar was then residing. They came with 
their whole familieswives, children and old folkcarrying portraits of 
the tsar and church banners. They chanted hymns as they marched. 
They were unarmed. Over 140,000 persons gathered in the streets. 
Th ey met with a hostile reception from Nicholas II. He gave orders 
to fire upon the unarmed workers. That day over a thousand workers 
were killed and more than two thousand wounded by the tsar¹s troops. 
The streets of St. Petersburg ran with workers¹ blood. 
Th e Bolsheviks had marched with the workers. Many of them were 
killed or arrested. There, in the streets running with workers¹ blood, the 
Bolsheviks explained to the workers who it was that bore the guilt for 
this heinous crime and how he was to be fought. 
January 9 came to be known as ³Bloody Sunday:² On that day the 
workers received a bloody lesson. It was their faith in the tsar that was 
riddled by bullets on that day. They came to realize that they could 
win their rights only by struggle. That evening barricades were already 
being erected in the working-class districts. The workers said: ³The 
tsar gave it to us; we¹ll now give it to him!² 
Th e fearful news of the tsar¹s bloody crime spread far and wide. 
The whole working class, the whole country was stirred by indignation 
and abhorrence. There was not a town where the workers did not 
strike in protest against the tsar¹s villainous act and did not put forward 
political demands. The workers now emerged into the streets with the 
slogan, ³Down with autocracy!² In January the number of strikers 
reached the immense figure of 440,000. More workers came out on 
strike in one month than during the whole preceding decade. The 
working-class movement rose to an unprecedented height. 
Revolution in Russia had begun. 
2. WORKERS¹ POLITICAL STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS. GROWTH 
OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AMONG THE PEASANTS. 
REVOLT ON THE BATTLESHIP ³POTEMKIN² 
After January 9 the revolutionary struggle of the workers grew 
more acute and assumed a political character. The workers began to 
pass from economic strikes and sympathy strikes to political strikes, to

59 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
demonstrations, and in places to armed resistance to the tsarist troops. 
Particularly stubborn and well organized were the strikes in the big 
cities such as St. Petersburg, Moscow, Warsaw, Riga and Baku, where 
large numbers of workers were concentrated. The metal workers 
marched in the front ranks of the fighting proletariat. By their strikes, 
the vanguard of the workers stirred up the less class-conscious sections 
and roused the whole working class to the struggle. The influence of 
the Social-Democrats grew rapidly. 
The May Day demonstrations in a number of towns were marked 
by clashes with police and troops. In Warsaw, the demonstration was 
fired upon and several hundred persons were killed or wounded. At 
the call of the Polish Social-Democrats the workers replied to the shooting 
in Warsaw by a general protest strike. Strikes and demonstrations 
did not cease throughout the month of May. In that month over 
200,000 workers went on strike throughout Russia. General strikes 
broke out in Baku, Lodz and Ivanovo-Voznesensk. More and more 
frequently the strikers and demonstrators clashed with the tsarist troops. 
Such clashes took place in a number of citiesOdessa, Warsaw, Riga, 
Lodz and others. 
Particularly acute was the struggle in Lodz, a large Polish industrial 
centre. The workers erected scores of barricades in the streets of Lodz 
and for three days (June 22-24, 1905) battled in the streets against the 
tsarist troops. Here armed action merged with a general strike. Lenin 
regarded these battles as the first armed action of the workers in Russia. 
The outstanding strike that summer was that of the workers of 
Ivanovo-Voznesensk. It lasted for about two and a half months, from 
the end of May to the beginning of August 1905. About 70,000 workers, 
among them many women, took part in the strike. It was led 
by the Bolshevik Northern Committee. Thousands of workers gathered 
almost daily outside the city on the banks of the River Talka. At these 
meetings they discussed their needs. The workers¹ meetings were addressed 
by Bolsheviks. In order to crush the strike, the tsarist authorities 
ordered the troops to disperse the workers and to fire upon them. Several 
scores of workers were killed and several hundred wounded. A state 
of emergency was proclaimed in the city. But the workers remained 
firm and would not return to work. They and their families starved, 
but would not surrender. It was only extreme exhaustion that in the 
end compelled them to return to work. The strike steeled the workers. 
It was an example of the courage, staunchness, endurance and solidarity 
of the working class. It was a real political education for the workers 
of Ivanovo-Voznesensk.

TO MAO

NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
During the strike the workers of Ivanovo-Voznesensk set up a 
Council of Representatives, which was actually one of the first Soviets 
of Workers¹ Deputies in Russia. 
The workers¹ political strikes stirred up the whole country. 
Following the town, the countryside began to rise. In the spring, 
peasant unrest broke out. The peasants marched in great crowds against 
the landlords, raided their estates, sugar refineries and distilleries, and set 
fire to their palaces and manors. In a number of places the peasants seized 
the land, resorted to wholesale cutting down of forests, and demanded 
hat the landed estates be turned over to the people. They seized the 
landlords¹ stores of grain and other products and divided them among 
the starving. The landlords fled in panic to the towns. The tsarist government 
dispatched soldiers and Cossacks to crush the peasants¹ revolts. 
The troops fired on the peasants, arrested the ³ringleaders² and flogged 
and tortured them. But the peasants would not cease their struggle. 
The peasant movement spread ever wider in the central parts of 
Russia, the Volga region, and in Transcaucasia, especially in Georgia. 
The Social-Democrats penetrated deeper into the countryside. The 
Central Committee of the Party issued an appeal to the peasants entitled: 
³To You, Peasants, We Address Our Word!² The Social-Democratic 
committees in the Tver, Saratov, Poltava, Chernigov, Ekaterinoslav, 
Tiflis and many other provinces issued appeals to the peasants. In the 
villages, the Social-Democrats would arrange meetings, organize circles 
among the peasants, and set up peasant committees. In the summer of 
1905 strikes of agricultural labourers, organized by Social-Democrats, 
occurred in many places. 
But this was only the beginning of the peasant struggle. The peasant 
movement affected only 85 uyezds (districts), or roughly one-seventh 
of the total number of uyezds in the European part of tsarist Russia. 
The movement of the workers and peasants and the series of 
reverses suffered by the Russian troops in the Russo-Japanese War had 
its influence on the armed forces. This bulwark of tsardom began to 
totter. 
In June 1905 a revolt broke out on the Potemkin, a battleship of 
the Black Sea Fleet. The battleship was at that time stationed near 
Odessa, where a general strike of the workers was in progress. The 
insurgent sailors wreaked vengeance on their more detested officers and 
brought the vessel to Odessa. The battleship Potemkin had gone over 
to the side of the revolution. 
Lenin attributed immense importance to this revolt. He considered

61 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
it necessary for the Bolsheviks to assume the leadership of this movement 
and to link it up with the movement of the workers, peasants and the 
local garrisons. 
The tsar dispatched several warships against the Potemkin, but the 
sailors of these vessels refused to fire on their insurgent comrades. For 
several days the red ensign of revolution waved from the mast of the 
battleship Potemkin. But at that time, in 1905, the Bolshevik Party 
was not the only party leading the movement, as was the case later, in 
1917. There were quite a number of Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and Anarchists on board the Potemkin. Consequently, although 
individual Social-Democrats took part in the revolt, it lacked proper and 
sufficiently experienced leadership. At decisive moments part of the sailors 
wavered. The other vessels of the Black Sea Fleet did not join the 
revolt of the Potemkin. Having run short of coal and provisions, the 
revolutionary battleship was compelled to make for the Rumanian shore 
and there surrender to the authorities. 
The revolt of the sailors on the battleship Potemkin ended in defeat. 
The sailors who subsequently fell into the hands of the tsarist government 
were committed for trial. Some were executed and others condemned 
to exile and penal servitude. But the revolt in itself was an 
event of the utmost importance. The Potemkin revolt was the first 
instance of mass revolutionary action in the army and navy, the first 
occasion on which a large unit of the armed forces of the tsar sided with 
the revolution. This revolt made the idea of the army and navy joining 
forces with the working class, the people, more comprehensible to and 
nearer to the heart of the workers and peasants, and especially of the 
soldiers and sailors themselves. 
The workers¹ recourse to mass political strikes and demonstrations, 
the growth of the peasant movement, the armed clashes between the 
people and the police and troops, and, finally, the revolt in the Black Sea 
Fleet, all went to show that conditions were ripening for an armed uprising 
of the people. This stirred the liberal bourgeoisie into action. 
Fearing the revolution, and at the same time frightening the tsar with 
the spectre of revolution, it sought to come to terms with the tsar against 
the revolution; it demanded slight reforms ³for the people² so as to 
³pacify² the people, to split the forces of the revolution and thus avert 
the ³horrors of revolution.² ³Better part with some of our land than 
part with our heads,² said the liberal landlords. The liberal bourgeoisie 
was preparing to share power with the tsar. ³The proletariat is fighting; 
the bourgeoisie is stealing towards power,² Lenin wrote in those days

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 62 
in reference to the tactics of the working class and the tactics of the 
liberal bourgeoisie. 
The tsarist government continued to suppress the workers and 
peasants with brutal ferocity. But it could not help seeing that it would 
never cope with the revolution by repressive measures alone. Therefore, 
without abandoning measures of repression, it resorted to a policy of 
manoeuvring. On the one hand, with the help of its agents-provocateurs, 
it incited the peoples of Russia against each other, engineering Jewish 
pogroms and mutual massacres of Armenians and Tatars. On the other 
hand, it promised to convene a ³representative institution² in the shape 
of a Zemsky Sobor or a State Duma, and instructed the Minister Bulygin 
to draw up a project for such a Duma, stipulating, however, that it was 
to have no legislative powers. All these measures were adopted in order 
to split the forces of revolution and to sever from it the moderate sections 
of the people. 
The Bolsheviks declared a boycott of the Bulygin Duma with the 
aim of frustrating this travesty of popular representation. 
The Mensheviks, on the other hand, decided not to sabotage the 
Duma and considered it necessary to take part in it. 
3. TACTICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOLSHEVIKS AND MENSHEVIKS. 
THIRD PARTY CONGRESS. LENIN¹S ³TWO TACTICS OF 
SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY IN THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION.² TACTICAL 
FOUNDATIONS OF THE MARXIST PARTY 
The revolution had set in motion all classes of society. The turn 
in the political life of the country caused by the revolution dislodged 
them from their old wonted positions and compelled them to regroup 
themselves in conformity with the new situation. Each class and each 
party endeavoured to work out its tactics, its line of conduct, its attitude 
towards other classes, and its attitude towards the government. Even the 
tsarist government found itself compelled to devise new and unaccustomed 
tactics, as instanced by the promise to convene a ³representative 
institution²the Bulygin Duma. 
The Social-Democratic Party, too, had to work out its tactics. This 
was dictated by the growing tide of the revolution. It was dictated by 
the practical questions that faced the proletariat and brooked no delay: 
organization of armed uprising, overthrow of the tsarist government, 
creation of a provisional revolutionary government, participation of the

63 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
Social-Democrats in this government, attitude towards the peasantry and 
towards the liberal bourgeoisie, etc. The Social-Democrats had to work 
out for themselves carefully considered and uniform Marxist tactics. 
But owing to the opportunism of the Mensheviks and their splitting 
activities, the Russian Social-Democratic Party was at that time divided 
into two groups. The split could not yet be considered complete, and 
formally the two groups were not yet two separate parties; but in reality 
they very much resembled two separate parties, each with its own leading 
centre and its own press. 
What helped to widen the split was the fact that to their old differences 
with the majority of the Party over organizational questions the 
Mensheviks added new differences, differences over tactical questions. 
The absence of a united party resulted in the absence of uniform 
party tactics. 
A way out of the situation may have been found by immediately 
summoning another congress, the Third Congress of the Party, establishing 
common tactics and binding the minority to carry out in good 
faith the decisions of the congress, the decisions of the majority. This 
was what the Bolsheviks proposed to the Mensheviks. But the Mensheviks 
would not hear of summoning the Third Congress. Considering 
it a crime to leave the Party any longer without tactics endorsed by the 
Party and binding upon all Party members, the Bolsheviks decided to 
take the initiative of convening the Third Congress into their own 
hands. 
All the Party organizations, both Bolshevik and Menshevik, were 
invited to the congress. But the Mensheviks refused to take part in the 
Third Congress and decided to hold one of their own. As the number 
of delegates at their congress proved to be small, they called it a conference, 
but actually it was a congress, a Menshevik party congress, 
whose decisions were considered binding on all Mensheviks. 
The Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Party met 
in London in April 1905. It was attended by 24 delegates representing 
20 Bolshevik Committees. All the large organizations of the Party were 
represented. 
The congress condemned the Mensheviks as ³a section that had split 
away from the Party² and passed on to the business on hand, the working 
out of the tactics of the Party. 
At the same time that this congress was held, the Mensheviks held 
their conference in Geneva. 
³Two congressestwo parties,² was the way Lenin summed up the 
situation.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 64 
Both the congress and the conference virtually discussed the same 
tactical questions, but the decisions they arrived at were diametrically 
opposite. The two sets of resolutions adopted by the congress and the 
conference respectively revealed the whole depth of the tactical difference 
between the Third Party Congress and the Menshevik conference, 
between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. 
Here are the main points of these differences. 
Tactical line of the Third Party Congress. The congress held that 
despite the bourgeois-democratic character of the revolution in progress, 
despite the fact that it could not at the given moment go beyond the 
limits of what was possible within the framework of capitalism, it was 
primarily the proletariat that was interested in its complete victory, for 
the victory of this revolution would enable the proletariat to organize 
itself, to grow politically, to acquire experience and competence in political 
leadership of the toiling masses, and to proceed from the bourgeois 
revolution to the Socialist revolution. 
Tactics of the proletariat designed to achieve the complete victory 
of the bourgeois-democratic revolution could find support only in the 
peasantry, for the latter could not settle scores with the landlords and 
obtain possession of their lands without the complete victory of the revolution. 
The peasantry was therefore the natural ally of the proletariat. 
The liberal bourgeoisie was not interested in the complete victory 
of this revolution, for it needed the tsarist regime as a whip against the 
workers and peasants, whom it feared more than anything else, and it 
would strive to preserve the tsarist regime, only somewhat restricting its 
powers. The liberal bourgeoisie would therefore attempt to end matters 
by coming to terms with the tsar on the basis of a constitutional monarchy. 
The revolution would win only if headed by the proletariat; if the 
proletariat, as the leader of the revolution, secured an alliance with the 
peasantry; if the liberal bourgeoisie were isolated; if the Social-Democratic 
Party took an active part in the organization of the uprising of the 
people against tsardom; if, as the result of a successful uprising, a provisional 
revolutionary government were set up that would be capable of 
destroying the counter-revolution root and branch and convening a 
Constituent Assembly representing the whole people; and if the Social- 
Democratic Party did not refuse, the circumstances being favourable, to 
take part in the provisional revolutionary government in order to carry 
the revolution to its conclusion. 
Tactical line of the Menshevik conference. Inasmuch as the revolution 
was a bourgeois revolution, only the liberal bourgeoisie could be its 
leader. The proletariat should not establish close relations with the peas

65 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
antry, but with the liberal bourgeoisie. The chief thing was not to 
frighten off the liberal bourgeoisie by a display of revolutionary spirit 
and not to give it a pretext to recoil from the revolution, for if it were 
to recoil from the revolution, the revolution would be weakened. 
It was possible that the uprising would prove victorious; but after 
the triumph of the uprising the Social-Democratic Party should step aside 
so as not to frighten away the liberal bourgeoisie. It was possible that as 
a result of the uprising a provisional revolutionary government would be 
set up; but the Social-Democratic Party should under no circumstances 
take part in it, because this government would not be Socialist in character, 
and becauseand this was the chief thingby its participation in 
this government and by its revolutionary spirit, the Social-Democratic 
Party might frighten off the liberal bourgeoisie and thus undermine the 
revolution. 
It would be better for the prospects of the revolution if some sort 
of representative institution were convened, of the nature of a Zemsky 
Sobor or a State Duma, which could be subjected to the pressure of 
the working class from without so as to transform it into a Constituent 
Assembly or impel it to convene a Constituent Assembly. 
The proletariat had its own specific, purely wage-worker interests, 
and it should attend to these interests only and not try to become the 
leader of the bourgeois revolution, which, being a general political revolution, 
concerned all classes and not the proletariat alone. 
Such, in brief, were the two tactics of the two groups of the Russian 
Social-Democratic Labour Party. 
In his historic book, Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic 
Revolution, Lenin gave a classical criticism of the tactics of the 
Mensheviks and a brilliant substantiation of the Bolshevik tactics. 
This book appeared in July 1905, that is, two months after the 
Third Party Congress. One might assume from its title that Lenin 
dealt in it only with tactical questions relating to the period of the bourgeois-
democratic revolution and had only the Russian Mensheviks in 
mind. But as a matter of fact when he criticized the tactics of the 
Mensheviks he at the same time exposed the tactics of international 
opportunism; and when he substantiated the Marxist tactics in the period 
of the bourgeois revolution and drew the distinction between the bourgeois 
revolution and the Socialist revolution, he at the same time formulated 
the fundamental principles of the Marxist tactics in the period of 
transition from the bourgeois revolution to the Socialist revolution. 
The fundamental tactical principles expounded by Lenin in his pam

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 66 
phlet, Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution, 
were as follows: 
1) The main tactical principle, one that runs through Lenin¹s whole 
book, is that the proletariat can and must be the leader of the bourgeoisdemocratic 
revolution, the guiding force of the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution in Russia. 
Lenin admitted the bourgeois character of this revolution, for, as 
he said, ³it is incapable of directly overstepping the bounds of a mere 
democratic revolution.² However, he held that it was not a revolution 
of the upper strata, but a people¹s revolution, one that would set in 
motion the whole people, the whole working class, the whole peasantry. 
Hence the attempts of the Mensheviks to belittle the significance of the 
bourgeois revolution for the proletariat, to depreciate the role of the proletariat 
in it, and to keep the proletariat away from it were in Lenin¹s 
opinion a betrayal of the interests of the proletariat. 
³Marxism,² Lenin said, ³teaches the proletarian not to keep 
aloof from the bourgeois revolution, not to be indifferent to it, not 
to allow the leadership of the revolution to be assumed by the bourgeoisie, 
but, on the contrary, to take a most energetic part in it, to 
fight most resolutely for consistent proletarian democracy, for carrying 
the revolution to its conclusion.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol.- 
III, p. 77.) 
³We must not forget,² Lenin says further, ³that there is not, 
nor can there be, at the present time, any other means of bringing 
Socialism nearer, than complete political liberty, than a democratic 
republic.² (Ibid., p. 122.) 
Lenin foresaw two possible outcomes of the revolution: 
a) Either it would end in a decisive victory over tsardom, in the 
overthrow of tsardom and the establishment of a democratic republic; 
b) Or, if the forces were inadequate, it might end in a deal between 
the tsar and the bourgeoisie at the expense of the people, in some sort 
of curtailed constitution, or, most likely, in some caricature of a constitution. 
The proletariat was interested in the better outcome of the two, that 
is, in a decisive victory over tsardom. But such an outcome was possible 
only if the proletariat succeeded in becoming the leader and guide of 
the revolution. 
³The outcome of the revolution,² Lenin said, ³depends on 
whether the working class will play the part of a subsidiary to the 
bourgeoisie, a subsidiary that is powerful in the force of its onslaught

67 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
against the autocracy but impotent politically, or whether it will play 
the part of leader of the people¹s revolution.² (Ibid., p. 41.) 
Lenin maintained that the proletariat had every possibility of escaping 
the fate of a subsidiary to the bourgeoisie, and of becoming the leader 
of the bourgeois-democratic revolution. This possibility, according to 
Lenin, arises from the following. 
First, ³the proletariat, being, by virtue of its very position, the most 
advanced and the only consistently revolutionary class, is for that very 
reason called upon to play the leading part in the general democratic 
revolutionary movement in Russia.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. 
ed., Vol. VIII, p. 75.) 
Secondly, the proletariat has its own political party, which is independent 
of the bourgeoisie and which enables the proletariat to weld 
itself ³into a united and independent political force.² (Ibid., p. 75.) 
Thirdly, the proletariat is more interested than the bourgeoisie in 
a decisive victory of the revolution, in view of which ³in a certain sense 
the bourgeois revolution is more advantageous to the proletariat than to 
the bourgeoisie.² (Ibid., p. 57.) 
³It is to the advantage of the bourgeoisie,² Lenin wrote, ³to 
rely on certain remnants of the past as against the proletariat, for 
instance, on the monarchy, the standing army, etc. It is to the 
advantage of the bourgeoisie if the bourgeois revolution does not too 
resolutely sweep away all the remnants of the past, but leaves some 
of them, i.e., if this revolution is not fully consistent, if it is not complete 
and if it is not determined and relentless. . . . It is of greater 
advantage to the bourgeoisie if the necessary changes in the direction 
of bourgeois democracy take place more slowly, more gradually, 
more cautiously, less resolutely, by means of reforms and not by 
means of revolution . . . if these changes develop as little as possible 
the independent revolutionary activity, initiative and energy of the 
common people, i.e., the peasantry and especially the workers, for 
otherwise it will be easier for the workers, as the French say, to 
hitch the rifle from one shoulder to the other,¹ i.e., to turn against 
the bourgeoisie the guns which the bourgeois revolution will place 
in their hands, the liberty which the revolution will bring, the democratic 
institutions which will spring up on the ground that is cleared 
of serfdom. On the other hand, it is more advantageous for the 
working class if the necessary changes in the direction of bourgeois 
democracy take place by way of revolution and not by way of 
reform; for the way of reform is the way of delay, of procrastina

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 68 
tion, of the painfully slow decomposition of the putrid parts of the 
national organism. It is the proletariat and the peasantry that suffer 
first of all and most of all from their putrefaction. The revolutionary 
way is the way of quick amputation, which is the least painful to the 
proletariat, the way of the direct removal of the decomposing parts, 
the way of fewest concessions to and least consideration for the monarchy 
and the disgusting, vile, rotten and contaminating institutions 
which go with it.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. III, pp. 75- 
6.) 
³That,² Lenin continues, ³is why the proletariat fights in the 
front ranks for a republic and contemptuously rejects silly and unworthy 
advice to take care not to frighten away the bourgeoisie.² 
(Ibid., p. 108.) 
In order to convert the possibility of the proletarian leadership of 
the revolution into a reality, in order that the proletariat might actually 
become the leader, the guiding force of the bourgeois revolution, at 
least two conditions were needed, according to Lenin. 
First, it was necessary for the proletariat to have an ally who was 
interested in a decisive victory over tsardom and who might be disposed 
to accept the leadership of the proletariat. This was dictated by the very 
idea of leadership, for a leader ceases to be a leader if there is nobody to 
lead, a guide ceases to be a guide if there is nobody to guide. Lenin 
considered that the peasantry was such an ally. 
Secondly, it was necessary that the class, which was fighting the 
proletariat for the leadership of the revolution and striving to become its 
sole leader, should be forced out of the arena of leadership and isolated. 
This too was dictated by the very idea of leadership, which precluded 
the possibility of there being two leaders of the revolution. Lenin considered 
that the liberal bourgeoisie was such a class. 
³Only the proletariat can be a consistent fighter for democracy,² 
Lenin said. ³It may become a victorious fighter for democracy only 
if the peasant masses join its revolutionary struggle.² (Ibid., p. 86.) 
And further: 
³The peasantry includes a great number of semi-proletarian as 
well as petty-bourgeois elements. This causes it also to be unstable 
and compels the proletariat to unite in a strictly class party. But the 
instability of the peasantry differs radically from the instability of the 
bourgeoisie, for at the present time the peasantry is interested not 
so much in the absolute preservation of private property as in the 
confiscation of the landed estates, one of the principal forms of private

69 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
property. While this does not cause the peasantry to become Socialist 
or cease to be petty-bourgeois, the peasantry is capable of becoming 
a whole-hearted and most radical adherent of the democratic revolution. 
The peasantry will inevitably become such if only the progress 
of revolutionary events, which is enlightening it, is not interrupted 
too soon by the treachery of the bourgeoisie and the defeat of the 
proletariat. Subject to this condition, the peasantry will inevitably 
become a bulwark of the revolution and the republic, for only a 
completely victorious revolution can give the peasantry everything 
in the sphere of agrarian reformseverything that the peasants desire, 
of which they dream, and of which they truly stand in need.² 
(Ibid., pp. 108-09.) 
Analysing the objections of the Mensheviks, who asserted that these 
Bolshevik tactics ³will compel the bourgeois classes to recoil from the 
cause of the revolution and thus curtail its scope,² and characterizing 
these objections as ³tactics of betrayal of the revolution,² as ³tactics 
which would convert the proletariat into a wretched appendage of the 
bourgeois classes,² Lenin wrote: 
³Those who really understand the role of the peasantry in the 
victorious Russian revolution would not dream of saying that the 
sweep of the revolution would be diminished if the bourgeoisie recoiled 
from it. For, as a matter of fact, the Russian revolution will 
begin to assume its real sweep, will really assume the widest revolutionary 
sweep possible in the epoch of bourgeois-democratic revolution, 
only when the bourgeoisie recoils from it and when the masses of the 
peasantry come out as active revolutionaries side by side with the proletariat. 
In order that it may be consistently carried to its conclusion, 
our democratic revolution must rely on such forces as are capable of 
paralysing the inevitable inconsistency of the bourgeoisie, i.e., capable 
precisely of causing it to recoil from the revolution.¹² (Ibid., p. 110.) 
Such is the main tactical principle regarding the proletariat as the 
leader of the bourgeois revolution, the fundamental tactical principle regarding 
the hegemony (leading role) of the proletariat in the bourgeois 
revolution, expounded by Lenin in his book, Two Tactics of Social-Democracy 
in the Democratic Revolution. 
This was a new line of the Marxist party on questions of tactics 
in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, a line fundamentally different 
from the tactical lines hitherto existing in the arsenal of Marxism. The 
situation before had been that in the bourgeois revolutionin Western 
Europe, for instanceit was the bourgeoisie that played the leading part,

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 70 
the proletariat willy-nilly playing the part of its subsidiary, while the 
peasantry was a reserve of the bourgeoisie. The Marxists considered 
such a combination more or less inevitable, at the same time stipulating 
that the proletariat must as far as possible fight for its own immediate 
class demands and have its own political party. Now, under the new 
historical conditions, according to Lenin, the situation was changing in 
such a way that the proletariat was becoming the guiding force of the 
bourgeois revolution, the bourgeoisie was being edged out of the leadership 
of the revolution, while the peasantry was becoming a reserve of 
the proletariat. 
The claim that Plekhanov ³also stood² for the hegemony of the 
proletariat is based upon a misunderstanding. Plekhanov flirted with the 
idea of the hegemony of the proletariat and was not averse to recognizing 
it in wordsthat is true. But in reality he was opposed to this idea in 
its essence. The hegemony of the proletariat implies the leading role of 
the proletariat in the bourgeois revolution, accompanied by a policy of 
alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry and a policy of isolation 
of the liberal bourgeoisie; whereas Plekhanov, as we know, was 
opposed to the policy of isolating the liberal bourgeoisie, favoured a policy 
of agreement with the liberal bourgeoisie, and was opposed to a policy 
of alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. As a matter of 
fact, Plekhanov¹s tactical line was the Menshevik line which rejected the 
hegemony of the proletariat. 
2) Lenin considered that the most effective means of overthrowing 
tsardom and achieving a democratic republic was a victorious armed uprising 
of the people. Contrary to the Mensheviks, Lenin held that ³the 
general democratic revolutionary movement has already brought about 
the necessity for an armed uprising,² that ³the organization of the proletariat 
for uprising² had already ³been placed on the order of the day 
as one of the essential, principal and indispensable tasks of the Party,² 
and that it was necessary ³to adopt the most energetic measures to arm 
the proletariat and to ensure the possibility of directly leading the uprising.² 
(Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. VIII, p. 75.) 
To guide the masses to an uprising and to turn it into an uprising 
of the whole people, Lenin deemed it necessary to issue such slogans, such 
appeals to the masses as would set free their revolutionary initiative, organize 
them for insurrection and disorganize the machinery of power of 
tsardom. He considered that these slogans were furnished by the tactical 
decisions of the Third Party Congress, to the defence of which his book 
Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution was 
devoted.

71 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
The following, he considered, were these slogans: 
a) ³Mass political strikes, which may be of great importance at 
the beginning and in the very process of the insurrection² (ibid., p. 75); 
b) ³Immediate realization, in a revolutionary way, of the 8-hour 
working day and of the other immediate demands of the working class² 
(ibid., p. 47); 
c) ³Immediate organization of revolutionary peasant committees in 
order to carry out² in a revolutionary way ³all the democratic changes,² 
including the confiscation of the landed estates (ibid., p. 88); 
d) Arming of the workers. 
Here two points are of particular interest: 
First, the tactics of realizing in a revolutionary way the 8-hour 
day in the towns, and the democratic changes in the countryside, that 
is, a way which disregards the authorities, disregards the law, which 
ignores both the authorities and the law, breaks the existing laws and 
establishes a new order by unauthorized action, as an accomplished fact. 
This was a new tactical method, the use of which paralysed the machinery 
of power of tsardom and set free the activity and creative initiative of 
the masses. These tactics gave rise to the revolutionary strike committees 
in the towns and the revolutionary peasant committees in the countryside, 
the former of which later developed into the Soviets of Workers¹ 
Deputies and the latter into the Soviets of Peasants¹ Deputies. 
Secondly, the use of mass political strikes, the use of general political 
strikes, which later, in the course of the revolution, were of prime importance 
in the revolutionary mobilization of the masses. This was a new 
and very important weapon in the hands of the proletariat, a weapon 
hitherto unknown in the practice of the Marxist parties and one that 
subsequently gained recognition. 
Lenin held that following the victorious uprising of the people the 
tsarist government should be replaced by a provisional revolutionary 
government. It would be the task of the provisional revolutionary government 
to consolidate the conquests of the revolution, to crush the 
resistance of the counter-revolution and to give effect to the minimum 
program of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party. Lenin maintained 
that unless these tasks were accomplished a decisive victory over 
tsardom would be impossible. And in order to accomplish these tasks 
and achieve a decisive victory over tsardom, the provisional revolutionary 
government would have to be not an ordinary kind of government, but 
a government of the dictatorship of the victorious classes, of the workers 
and peasants; it would have to be a revolutionary dictatorship of the 
proletariat and peasantry. Citing Marx¹s well-known thesis that ³after

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 72 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
a revolution every provisional organization of the state requires a dictatorship, 
and an energetic dictatorship at that,² Lenin came to the conclusion 
that if the provisional revolutionary government was to ensure a decisive 
victory over tsardom, it could be nothing else but a dictatorship of the 
proletariat and peasantry. 
³A decisive victory of the revolution over tsardom is the revolutionary-
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry,² 
Lenin said. ³. . . And such a victory will be precisely a dictatorship, 
i.e., it must inevitably rely on military force, on the arming of the 
masses, on an uprising and not on institutions of one kind or another, 
established in a lawful¹ or peaceful¹ way. It can be only a 
dictatorship, for the realization of the changes which are urgently and 
absolutely indispensable for the proletariat and the peasantry will 
call forth the desperate resistance of the landlords, of the big bourgeoisie, 
and of tsardom. Without a dictatorship it is impossible to 
break down that resistance and to repel the counter-revolutionary 
attempts. But of course it will be a democratic, not a Socialist dictatorship. 
It will not be able (without a series of intermediary stage 
of revolutionary development) to affect the foundations of capitalism. 
At best it may bring about a radical redistribution of landed property 
in favour of the peasantry, establish consistent and full democracy, 
including the formation of a republic, eradicate all the oppressive 
features of Asiatic bondage, not only in village but also in factory 
life, lay the foundation for a thorough improvement in the position 
of the workers and for a rise in their standard of living, andlast 
but not leastcarry the revolutionary conflagration into Europe. 
Such a victory will by no means as yet transform our bourgeois 
revolution into a Socialist revolution; the democratic revolution 
will not directly overstep the bounds of bourgeois social and economic 
relationships; nevertheless, the significance of such a victory for the 
future development of Russia and of the whole world will be immense. 
Nothing will raise the revolutionary energy of the world 
proletariat so much, nothing will shorten the path leading to its 
complete victory to such an extent, as this decisive victory of the 
revolution that has now started in Russia.² (Lenin, Selected Works, 
Vol. III, p. 82-3.) 
As to the attitude of the Social-Democrats towards the provisional 
revolutionary government and as to whether it would be permissible for 
them to take part in it, Lenin fully upheld the resolution of the Third 
Party Congress on the subject, which reads:

73 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
³Subject to the relation of forces, and other factors which cannot 
be exactly determined beforehand, representatives of our Party 
may participate in the provisional revolutionary government for the 
purpose of relentless struggle against all counter-revolutionary attempts 
and of the defence of the independent interests of the working 
class; an indispensable condition for such participation is that the 
Party should exercise strict control over its representatives and that 
the independence of the Social-Democratic Party, which is striving 
for a complete Socialist revolution and, consequently, is irreconcilably 
hostile to all the bourgeois parties, should be strictly maintained; 
whether the participation of Social-Democrats in the provisional revolutionary 
government prove possible or not, we must propagate 
among the broadest masses of the proletariat the necessity for permanent 
pressure to be brought to bear upon the provisional government 
by the armed proletariat, led by the Social-Democratic Party, for 
the purpose of defending, consolidating and extending the gains of 
the revolution.² (Ibid., pp. 46-7.) 
As to the Mensheviks¹ objection that the provisional government 
would still be a bourgeois government, that the Social-Democrats could 
not be permitted to take part in such a government unless one wanted 
to commit the same mistake as the French Socialist Millerand when he 
joined the French bourgeois government, Lenin parried this objection 
by pointing out that the Mensheviks were here mixing up two different 
things and were betraying their inability to treat the question as Marxists 
should. In France it was a question of Socialists taking part in a reactionary 
bourgeois government at a time when there was no revolutionary 
situation in the country, which made it incumbent upon the Socialists 
not to join such a government; in Russia, on the other hand, it was a 
question of Socialists taking part in a revolutionary bourgeois government 
fighting for the victory of the revolution at a time when the revolution 
was in full swing, a circumstance which would make it permissible for, 
and, under favourable circumstances, incumbent upon the Social-Democrats 
to take part in such a government in order to strike at the counterrevolution 
not only ³from below,² from without, but also ³from above,² 
from within the government. 
3) While advocating the victory of the bourgeois revolution and 
the achievement of a democratic republic, Lenin had not the least intention 
of coming to a halt in the democratic stage and confining the scope 
of the revolutionary movement to the accomplishment of bourgeois-democratic 
tasks. On the contrary, Lenin maintained that following upon 
the accomplishment of the democratic tasks, the proletariat and the other

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 74 
exploited masses would have to begin a struggle, this time for the Socialist 
revolution. Lenin knew this and regarded it as the duty of Social-Democrats 
to do everything to make the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
pass into the Socialist revolution. Lenin held that the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and the peasantry was necessary not in order to end 
the revolution at the point of consummation of its victory over tsardom, 
but in order to prolong the state of revolution as much as possible, to 
destroy the last remnants of counter-revolution, to make the flame of 
revolution spread to Europe, and, having in the meantime given the proletariat 
the opportunity of educating itself politically and organizing itself 
into a great army, to begin the direct transition to the Socialist revolution. 
Dealing with the scope of the bourgeois revolution, and with the 
character the Marxist party should lend it, Lenin wrote: 
³The proletariat must carry to completion the democratic revolution, 
by allying to itself the mass of the peasantry in order to 
crush by force the resistance of the autocracy and to paralyse the 
instability of the bourgeoisie. The proletariat must accomplish the 
Socialist revolution by allying to itself the mass of the semi-proletarian 
elements of the population in order to crush by force the 
resistance of the bourgeoisie and to paralyse the instability of the 
peasantry and the petty bourgeoisie. Such are the tasks of the proletariat, 
which the new Iskra-ists (that is, MensheviksEd.) always 
present so narrowly in their arguments and resolutions about the 
scope of the revolution.² (Ibid., pp. 110-11.) 
And further: 
³At the head of the whole of the people, and particularly of the 
peasantryfor complete freedom, for a consistent democratic revolution, 
for a republic! At the head of all the toilers and the exploited
for Socialism! Such must in practice be the policy of the 
revolutionary proletariat, such is the class slogan which must permeate 
and determine the solution of every tactical problem, of every practical 
step of the workers¹ party during the revolution.² (Ibid., p. 124.) 
In order to leave nothing unclear, two months after the appearance 
of the Two Tactics Lenin wrote an article entitled ³Attitude of Social- 
Democrats to the Peasant Movement,² in which he explained: 
³From the democratic revolution we shall at once, and just 
in accordance with the measure of our strength, the strength of the 
class-conscious and organized proletariat, begin to pass to the Socialist 
revolution. We stand for uninterrupted revolution. We shall not 
stop half way.² (Ibid., p. 145.)

75 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
This was a new line in the question of the relation between the 
bourgeois revolution and the Socialist revolution, a new theory of a regrouping 
of forces around the proletariat, towards the end of the bourgeois 
revolution, for a direct transition to the Socialist revolutionthe 
theory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution passing into the Socialist 
revolution. 
In working out this new line, Lenin based himself, first, on the 
well-known thesis of uninterrupted revolution advanced by Marx at the end 
of the forties of the last century in the Address to the Communist 
League, and, secondly, on the well-known idea of the necessity of combining 
the peasant revolutionary movement with the proletarian revolution 
which Marx expressed in a letter to Engels in 1856, saying that: 
³the whole thing in Germany will depend on the possibility of backing 
the proletarian revolution by some second edition of the Peasants¹ 
War.² However, these brilliant ideas of Marx were not developed 
subsequently in the works of Marx and Engels, while the theoreticians 
of the Second International did their utmost to bury them and consign 
them to oblivion. To Lenin fell the task of bringing these forgotten 
ideas of Marx to light and restoring them to their full rights. But in 
restoring these Marxian ideas, Lenin did notand could notconfine 
himself to merely repeating them, but developed them further and 
moulded them into a harmonious theory of Socialist revolution by introducing 
a new factor, an indispensable factor of the Socialist revolution, 
namely, an alliance of the proletariat with the semi-proletarian elements 
of town and country as a condition for the victory of the proletarian 
revolution. 
This line confuted the tactical position of the West-European Social- 
Democratic parties who took it for granted that after the bourgeois 
revolution the peasant masses, including the poor peasants, would necessarily 
desert the revolution, as a result of which the bourgeois revolution 
would be followed by a prolonged interval, a long ³lull² lasting fifty 
or a hundred years, if not longer, during which the proletariat would be 
³peacefully² exploited and the bourgeoisie would ³lawfully² enrich itself 
until the time came round for a new revolution, a Socialist revolution. 
This was a new theory which held that the Socialist revolution would 
be accomplished not by the proletariat in isolation as against the whole 
bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat as the leading class which would have 
as allies the semi-proletarian elements of the population, the ³toiling 
and exploited millions.² 
According to this theory the hegemony of the proletariat in the bourgeois 
revolution, the proletariat being in alliance with the peasantry,

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 76 
would grow into the hegemony of the proletariat in the Socialist revolution, 
the proletariat now being in alliance with the other labouring and 
exploited masses, while the democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and 
the peasantry would prepare the ground for the Socialist dictatorship of 
the proletariat. 
It refuted the theory current among the West-European Social- 
Democrats who denied the revolutionary potentialities of the semi-proletarian 
masses of town and country and took for granted that ³apart 
from the bourgeoisie and the proletariat we perceive no social forces in our 
country in which oppositional or revolutionary combinations might find 
support² (these were Plekhanov¹s words, typical of the West-European 
Social-Democrats). 
The West-European Social-Democrats held that in the Socialist 
revolution the proletariat would stand alone, against the whole bourgeoisie, 
without allies, against all the non-proletarian classes and strata. 
They would not take account of the fact that capital exploits not only 
the proletarians but also the semi-proletarian millions of town and country, 
who are crushed by capitalism and who may become allies of the 
proletariat in the struggle for the emancipation of society from the capitalist 
yoke. The West-European Social-Democrats therefore held that 
conditions were not yet ripe for a Socialist revolution in Europe, that the 
conditions could be considered ripe only when the proletariat became the 
majority of the nation, the majority of society, as a result of the further 
economic development of society. 
This spurious anti-proletarian standpoint of the West-European 
Social-Democrats was completely upset by Lenin¹s theory of the Socialist 
revolution. 
Lenin¹s theory did not yet contain any direct conclusion regarding 
the possibility of a victory of Socialism in one country, taken singly. But 
it did contain all, or nearly all, the fundamental elements necessary for 
the drawing of such a conclusion sooner or later. 
As we know, Lenin arrived at this conclusion ten years later, in 
1915. 
Such are the fundamental tactical principles expounded by Lenin 
in his historic book, Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic 
Revolution. 
The historic significance of this book consists above all in the fact 
that in it Lenin ideologically shattered the petty-bourgeois tactical line 
of the Mensheviks, armed the working class of Russia for the further 
development of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, for a new onslaught 
on tsardom, and put before the Russian Social-Democrats a clear perspec

77 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
tive of the necessity of the bourgeois revolution passing into the Socialist 
revolution. 
But this does not exhaust the significance of Lenin¹s book. Its invaluable 
significance consists in that it enriched Marxism with a new 
theory of revolution and laid the foundation for the revolutionary tactics 
of the Bolshevik Party with the help of which in 1917 the proletariat 
of our country achieved the victory over capitalism. 
4. FURTHER RISE OF THE REVOLUTION. ALL-RUSSIAN POLITICAL 
STRIKE OF OCTOBER 1905. RETREAT OF TSARDOM. THE TSAR¹S 
MANIFESTO. RISE OF THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS¹ DEPUTIES 
By the autumn of 1905 the revolutionary movement had swept 
the whole country and gained tremendous momentum. 
On September 19 a printers¹ strike broke out in Moscow. It spread 
to St. Petersburg and a number of other cities. In Moscow itself the 
printers¹ strike was supported by the workers in other industries and 
developed into a general political strike. 
In the beginning of October a strike started on the Moscow-Kazan 
Railway. Within two days it was joined by all the railwaymen of the 
Moscow railway junction and soon all the railways of the country were 
in the grip of the strike. The postal and telegraph services came to a 
standstill. In various cities of Russia the workers gathered at huge 
meetings and decided to down tools. The strike spread to factory after 
factory, mill after mill, city after city, and region after region. The 
workers were joined by the minor employees, students and intellectuals 
lawyers, engineers and doctors. 
The October political strike became an all-Russian strike which embraced 
nearly the whole country, including the most remote districts, 
and nearly all the workers, including the most backward strata. About 
one million industrial workers alone took part in the general political 
strike, not counting the large number of railwaymen, postal and telegraph 
employees and others. The whole life of the country came to a standstill. 
The government was paralysed. 
The working class headed the struggle of the masses against the 
autocracy. 
The Bolshevik slogan of a mass political strike had borne fruit. 
The October general strike revealed the power and might of the 
proletarian movement and compelled the mortally frightened tsar to issue

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 78 
his Manifesto of October 17, 1905. This Manifesto promised the people 
³the unshakable foundations of civil liberty: real inviolability of person, 
and freedom of conscience, speech, assembly and association.² It promised 
to convene a legislative Duma and to extend the franchise to all 
classes of the population. 
Thus, Bulygin¹s deliberative Duma was swept away by the tide 
of revolution. The Bolshevik tactics of boycotting the Bulygin Duma 
proved to have been right. 
Nevertheless, the Manifesto of October 17 was a fraud on the 
people, a trick of the tsar to gain some sort of respite in which to lull the 
credulous and to win time to rally his forces and then to strike at the 
revolution. In words the tsarist government promised liberty, but actually 
it granted nothing substantial. So far, promises were all that the 
workers and peasants had received from the government. Instead of 
the broad political amnesty which was expected, on October 21 amnesty 
was granted to only a small section of political prisoners. At the same 
time, with the object of dividing the forces of the people, the government 
engineered a number of sanguinary Jewish pogroms, in which many 
thousands of people perished; and in order to crush the revolution it 
created police-controlled gangster organizations known as the League 
of the Russian People and the League of Michael the Archangel. These 
organizations, in which a prominent part was played by reactionary landlords, 
merchants, priests, and semi-criminal elements of the vagabond 
type, were christened by the people ³Black-Hundreds.² The Black- 
Hundreds, with the support of the police, openly manhandled and murdered 
politically advanced workers, revolutionary intellectuals and students, 
burned down meeting places and fired upon assemblies of citizens. 
These so far were the only results of the tsar¹s Manifesto. 
There was a popular song at the time which ran: 
³The tsar caught fright, issued a Manifesto: 
Liberty for the dead, for the livingarrest.² 
The Bolsheviks explained to the masses that the Manifesto of October 
17 was a trap. They branded the conduct of the government after the 
promulgation of the Manifesto as provocative. The Bolsheviks called 
the workers to arms, to prepare for armed uprising. 
The workers set about forming fighting squads with greater energy 
than ever. It became clear to them that the first victory of October 17, 
wrested by the general political strike, demanded of them further efforts, 
the continuation of the struggle for the overthrow of tsardom. 
Lenin regarded the Manifesto of October 17 as an expression of 
a certain temporary equilibrium of forces: the proletariat and the peas

79 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
antry, having wrung the Manifesto from the tsar, were still not strong 
enough to overthrow tsardom, whereas tsardom was no longer able to 
rule by the old methods alone and had been compelled to give a paper 
promise of ³civil liberties² and a ³legislative² Duma. 
In those stormy days of the October political strike, in the fire of 
the struggle against tsardom, the revolutionary creative initiative of the 
working-class masses forged a new and powerful weaponthe Soviets 
of Workers¹ Deputies. 
The Soviets of Workers¹ Deputieswhich were assemblies of delegates 
from all mills and factoriesrepresented a type of mass political 
organization of the working class which the world had never seen before. 
The Soviets that first arose in 1905 were the prototype of the 
Soviet power which the proletariat, led by the Bolshevik Party, set up in 
1917. The Soviets were a new revolutionary form of the creative initiative 
of the people. They were set up exclusively by the revolutionary 
sections of the population, in defiance of all laws and prescripts of tsardom. 
They were a manifestation of the independent action of the people 
who were rising to fight tsardom. 
The Bolsheviks regarded the Soviets as the embryo of revolutionary 
power. They maintained that the strength and significance of the 
Soviets would depend solely on the strength and success of the uprising. 
The Mensheviks regarded the Soviets neither as embryonic organs 
of revolutionary power nor as organs of uprising. They looked upon 
the Soviets as organs of local self-government, in the nature of democratized 
municipal government bodies. 
In St. Petersburg, elections to the Soviet of Workers¹ Deputies took 
place in all the mills and factories on October 13 (26, New Style) 1905. 
The first meeting of the Soviet was held that night. Moscow followed 
St. Petersburg in forming a Soviet of Workers¹ Deputies. 
The St. Petersburg Soviet of Workers¹ Deputies, being the Soviet 
of the most important industrial and revolutionary centre of Russia, the 
capital of the tsarist empire, ought to have played a decisive role in the 
Revolution of 1905. However, it did not perform its task, owing to 
its bad, Menshevik leadership. As we know, Lenin had not yet arrived 
in St. Petersburg; he was still abroad. The Mensheviks took advantage 
of Lenin¹s absence to make their way into the St. Petersburg Soviet and 
to seize hold of its leadership. It was not surprising under such circumstances 
that the Mensheviks Khrustalev, Trotsky, Parvus and others managed 
to turn the St. Petersburg Soviet against the policy of an uprising. 
Instead of bringing the soldiers into close contact with the Soviet and 
linking them up with the common struggle, they demanded that the sol

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 80 
diers be withdrawn from St. Petersburg. The Soviet, instead of arming 
the workers and preparing them for an uprising, just marked time and 
was against preparations for an uprising. 
Altogether different was the role played in the revolution by the 
Moscow Soviet of Workers¹ Deputies. From the very first the Moscow 
Soviet pursued a thoroughly revolutionary policy. The leadership of the 
Moscow Soviet was in the hands of the Bolsheviks. Thanks to them, 
side by side with the Soviet of Workers¹ Deputies, there arose in Moscow 
a Soviet of Soldiers¹ Deputies. The Moscow Soviet became an organ of 
armed uprising. 
In the period, October to December 1905, Soviets of Workers¹ 
Deputies were set up in a number of large towns and in nearly all the 
working-class centres. Attempts were made to organize Soviets of Soldiers¹ 
and Sailors¹ Deputies and to unite them with the Soviets of Workers¹ 
Deputies. In some localities Soviets of Workers¹ and Peasants¹ 
Deputies were formed. 
The influence of the Soviets was tremendous. In spite of the fact 
that they often arose spontaneously, lacked definite structure and were 
loosely organized, they acted as a governmental power. Without legal 
authority, they introduced freedom of the press and an 8-hour working 
day. They called upon the people not to pay taxes to the tsarist government. 
In some cases they confiscated government funds and used them 
for the needs of the revolution. 
5. DECEMBER ARMED UPRISING. DEFEAT OF THE UPRISING. RETREAT 
OF THE REVOLUTION. FIRST STATE DUMA. FOURTH 
(UNITY) PARTY CONGRESS 
During October and November 1905 the revolutionary struggle of 
the masses went on developing with intense vigour. Workers¹ strikes 
continued. 
The struggle of the peasants against the landlords assumed wide 
dimensions in the autumn of 1905. The peasant movement embraced 
over one-third of the uyezds of the country. The provinces of Saratov, 
Tambov, Chernigov, Tiflis, Kutais and several others were the scenes 
of veritable peasant revolts. Yet the onslaught of the peasant masses 
was still inadequate. The peasant movement lacked organization and 
leadership. 
Unrest increased also among the soldiers in a number of cities 
Tiflis, Vladivostok, Tashkent, Samarkand, Kursk, Sukhum, Warsaw,

81 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
Kiev, and Riga. Revolts broke out in Kronstadt and among the sailors 
of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol (November 1905). But the revolts 
were isolated, and the tsarist government was able to suppress them. 
Revolts in units of the army and navy were frequently provoked by 
the brutal conduct of the officers, by bad food (³bean riots²), and 
similar causes. The bulk of the sailors and soldiers in revolt did not 
yet clearly realize the necessity for the overthrow of the tsarist government, 
for the energetic prosecution of the armed struggle. They were 
still too peaceful and complacent; they frequently made the mistake 
of releasing officers who had been arrested at the outbreak of the revolt, 
and would allow themselves to be placated by the promises and coaxing 
of their superiors. 
The revolutionary movement had approached the verge of armed 
insurrection. The Bolsheviks called upon the masses to rise in arms 
against the tsar and the landlords, and explained to them that this was inevitable. 
The Bolsheviks worked indefatigably in preparing for armed 
uprising. Revolutionary work was carried on among the soldiers and 
sailors, and military organizations of the Party were set up in the armed 
forces. Workers¹ fighting squads were formed in a number of cities, 
and their members taught the use of arms. The purchase of arms from 
abroad and the smuggling of them into Russia was organized, prominent 
members of the Party taking part in arranging for their transportation. 
In November 1905 Lenin returned to Russia. He took a direct 
part in the preparations for armed uprising, while keeping out of the 
way of the tsar¹s gendarmes and spies. His articles in the Bolshevik 
newspaper, Novaya Zhizn (New Life), served to guide the Party in its 
day-to-day work. 
At this period Comrade Stalin was carrying on tremendous revolutionary 
work in Transcaucasia. He exposed and lashed the Mensheviks 
as foes of the revolution and of the armed uprising. He resolutely prepared 
the workers for the decisive battle against the autocracy. Speaking 
at a meeting of workers in Tiflis on the day the tsar¹s Manifesto was 
announced, Comrade Stalin said: 
³What do we need in order to really win? We need three 
things: firstarms, secondarms, thirdarms and arms again!² 
In December 1905 a Bolshevik Conference was held in Tammerfors, 
Finland. Although the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks formally belonged to 
one Social-Democratic Party, they actually constituted two different parties, 
each with its own leading centre. At this conference Lenin and

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 82 
Stalin met for the first time. Until then they had maintained contact by 
correspondence and through comrades. 
Of the decisions of the Tammerfors Conference, the following two 
should be noted: one on the restoration of the unity of the Party, which 
had virtually been split into two parties, and the other on the boycott 
of the First Duma, known as the Witte Duma. 
As by that time the armed uprising had already begun in Moscow, 
the conference, on Lenin¹s advice, hastily completed its work and dispersed 
to enable the delegates to participate personally in the uprising. 
But the tsarist government was not dozing either. It too was preparing 
for a decisive struggle. Having concluded peace with Japan, and 
thus lessened the difficulties of its position, the tsarist government assumed 
the offensive against the workers and peasants. It declared martial law 
in a number of provinces where peasant revolts were rife, issued the 
brutal commands ³take no prisoners² and ³spare no bullets,² and gave 
orders for the arrest of, the leaders of the revolutionary movement and 
the dispersal of the Soviets of Workers¹ Deputies. 
In reply to this, the Moscow Bolsheviks and the Moscow Soviet 
of Workers¹ Deputies which they led, and which was connected with 
the broad masses of the workers, decided to make immediate preparations 
for armed uprising. On December 5 (18) the Moscow Bolshevik 
Committee resolved to call upon the Soviet to declare a general political 
strike with the object of turning it into an uprising in the course of the 
struggle. This decision was supported at mass meetings of the workers. 
The Moscow Soviet responded to the will of the working class and 
unanimously resolved to start a general political strike. 
When the Moscow proletariat began the revolt, it had a fighting 
organization of about one thousand combatants, more than half of whom 
were Bolsheviks. In addition there were fighting squads in several of the 
Moscow factories. In all, the insurrectionaries had a force of about two 
thousand combatants. The workers expected to neutralize the garrison 
and to win over a part of it to their side. 
The political strike started in Moscow on December 7 (20). However, 
efforts to spread it to the whole country failed; it met with inadequate 
support in St. Petersburg, and this reduced the chances of success 
of the uprising from the very outset. The Nikolayevskaya (now 
the October) Railway remained in the hands of the tsarist government. 
Traffic on this line was not suspended, which enabled the government 
to transfer regiments of the Guard from St. Petersburg to Moscow for 
the suppression of the uprising.

83 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
In Moscow itself the garrison vacillated. The workers had begun 
the uprising partly in expectation of receiving support from the garrison. 
But the revolutionaries had delayed too long, and the government managed 
to cope with the unrest in the garrison. 
The first barricades appeared in Moscow on December 9 (22). 
Soon the streets of the city were covered with barricades. The tsarist 
government brought artillery into action. It concentrated a force many 
times exceeding the strength of the insurrectionaries. For nine days on 
end several thousand armed workers waged a heroic fight. It was only 
by bringing regiments from St. Petersburg, Tver and the Western Territory 
that the tsarist government was able to crush the uprising. On the 
very eve of the fighting the leadership of the uprising was partly arrested 
and partly isolated. The members of the Moscow Bolshevik Committee 
were arrested. The armed action took the form of disconnected uprisings 
of separate districts Deprived of a directing centre, and lacking 
a common plan of operations for the whole city, the districts mainly 
confined themselves to defensive action. This was the chief source of 
weakness of the Moscow uprising and one of the causes of its defeat, as 
Lenin later pointed out. 
The uprising assumed a particularly stubborn and bitter character 
in the Krasnaya Presnya district of Moscow. This was the main stronghold 
and centre of the uprising. Here the best of the fighting squads, led 
by Bolsheviks, were concentrated. But Krasnaya Presnya was suppressed 
by fire and sword; it was drenched in blood and ablaze with the fires 
caused by artillery. The Moscow uprising was crushed. 
The uprising was not confined to Moscow. Revolutionary uprisings 
broke out in a number of other cities and districts. There were armed 
uprisings in Krasnoyarsk, Motovlikha (Perm), Novorossisk, Sormovo, 
Sevastapol and Kronstadt. 
The oppressed nationalities of Russia also rose in armed struggle. 
Nearly the whole of Georgia was up in arms. A big uprising took place 
in the Ukraine, in the cities of Gorlovka, Alexandrovsk and Lugansk 
(now Voroshilovgrad) in the Donetz Basin. A stubborn struggle was 
waged in Latvia. In Finland the workers formed their Red Guard and 
rose in revolt. 
But all these uprisings, like the uprising in Moscow, were crushed 
with inhuman ferocity by the autocracy. 
The appraisals of the December armed uprising given by the Mensheviks 
and the Bolsheviks differed. 
³They should not have taken to arms,² was the rebuke the Menshevik 
Plekhanov flung at the Party after the uprising. The Mensheviks

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 84 
argued that an uprising was unnecessary and pernicious, that it could be 
dispensed with in the revolution, that success could be achieved not by 
armed uprising, but by peaceful methods of struggle. 
The Bolsheviks branded this stand as treachery. They maintained 
that the experience of the Moscow armed uprising had but confirmed 
that the working class could wage a successful armed struggle. In reply 
to Plekhanov¹s rebuke³they should not have taken to arms²Lenin 
said: 
³On the contrary, we should have taken to arms more resolutely, 
energetically and aggressively; we should have explained to the 
masses that it was impossible to confine ourselves to a peaceful strike 
and that a fearless and relentless armed fight was indispensable.² 
(Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 348.) 
The uprising of December 1905 was the climax of the revolution. 
The tsarist autocracy defeated the uprising. Thereafter the revolution 
took a turn and began to recede. The tide of revolution gradually 
subsided. 
The tsarist government hastened to take advantage of this defeat 
to deal the final blow to the revolution. The tsar¹s hangmen and jailers 
began their bloody work. Punitive expeditions raged in Poland, Latvia, 
Esthonia, Transcaucasia and Siberia. 
But the revolution was not yet crushed. The workers and revolutionary 
peasants retreated slowly, putting up a fight. New sections of 
the workers were drawn into the struggle. Over a million workers took 
part in strikes in 1906; 740,000 in 1907. The peasant movement 
embraced about one-half of the uyezds of tsarist Russia in the first half 
of 1906, and one-fifth in the second half of the year. Unrest continued 
in the army and navy. 
The tsarist government, in combating the revolution, did not confine 
itself to repressive measures. Having achieved its first successes by 
repressive measures, it decided to deal a fresh blow at the revolution by 
convening a new Duma, a ³legislative² Duma. It hoped in this way to 
sever the peasants from the revolution and thus put an end to it. In 
December c the tsarist government promulgated a law providing 
for the convocation of a new, a ³legislative² Duma as distinct from the 
old, ³deliberative² Bulygin Duma, which had been swept away as the 
result of the Bolshevik boycott. The tsarist election law was of course 
anti-democratic. Elections were not universal. Over half the population 
for example, women and over two million workerswere deprived 
of the right of vote altogether. Elections were not equal. The electorate

85 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
was divided into four curias, as they were called: the agrarian (landlords), 
the urban (bourgeoisie), the peasant and the worker curias. 
Election was not direct, but by several stages. There was actually no 
secret ballot. The election law ensured the overwhelming preponderance 
in the Duma of a handful of landlords and capitalists over the millions 
of workers and peasants. 
The tsar intended to make use of the Duma to divert the masses 
from the revolution. In those days a large proportion of the peasants 
believed that they could obtain land through the Duma. The Constitutional-
Democrats, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries deceived 
workers and peasants by stating that the system the people needed could 
be obtained without uprising, without revolution. It was to fight this 
fraud on the people that the Bolsheviks announced and pursued the 
tactics of boycotting the First State Duma. This was in accordance with 
the decision passed by the Tammerfors Conference. 
In their fight against tsardom, the workers demanded the unity of 
the forces of the Party, the unification of the party of the proletariat. 
Armed with the decision of the Tammerfors Conference on unity, the 
Bolsheviks supported this demand of the workers and proposed to 
the Mensheviks that a unity congress of the Party be called. Under the 
pressure of the workers, the Mensheviks had to consent to unification. 
Lenin was in favour of unification, but only of such unification as 
would not cover up the differences that existed over the problems of the 
revolution. Considerable damage was done to the Party by the conciliators 
(Bogdanov, Krassin and others), who tried to prove that no serious 
differences existed between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. Lenin 
fought the conciliators, insisting that the Bolsheviks should come to the 
congress with their own platform, so that the workers might clearly see 
what the position of the Bolsheviks was and on what basis unification 
was being effected. The Bolsheviks drew up such a platform and submitted 
it to the Party members for discussion. 
The Fourth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., known as the Unity Congress, 
met in Stockholm (Sweden) in April 1906. It was attended by 
111 delegates with right of vote, representing 57 local organizations 
of the Party. In addition, there were representatives from the national 
Social-Democratic parties: 3 from the Bund, 3 from the Polish Social- 
Democratic Party, and 3 from the Lettish Social-Democratic organization.
Owing to the smash-up of the Bolshevik organizations during and 
after the December uprising, not all of them were able to send delegates. 
Moreover, during the ³days of liberty² of 1905, the Mensheviks had

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 86 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
admitted into their ranks a large number of petty-bourgeois intellectuals 
who had nothing whatever in common with revolutionary Marxism. 
It will suffice to say that the Tiflis Mensheviks (and there were very 
few industrial workers in Tiflis) sent as many delegates to the congress 
as the largest of the proletarian organizations, the St. Petersburg organization. 
The result was that at the Stockholm Congress the Mensheviks 
had a majority, although, it is true, an insignificant one. 
This composition of the congress determined the Menshevik character 
of the decisions on a number of questions. 
Only formal unity was effected at this congress. In reality, the 
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks retained their own views and their own 
independent organizations. 
The chief questions discussed at the Fourth Congress were the agrarian 
question, the current situation and the class tasks of the proletariat, 
policy towards the State Duma, and organizational questions. 
Although the Mensheviks constituted the majority at this congress 
they were obliged to agree to Lenin¹s formulation of the first paragraph 
of the Party Rules dealing with Party membership, in order not to antagonize 
the workers. 
On the agrarian question, Lenin advocated the nationalization of 
the land. He held that the nationalization of the land would be possible 
only with the victory of the revolution, after tsardom had been overthrown. 
Under such circumstances the nationalization of the land would 
make it easier for the proletariat, in alliance with the poor peasants, to 
pass to the Socialist revolution. Nationalization of the land meant the 
confiscation of all the landed estates without compensation and turning 
them over to the peasantry. The Bolshevik agrarian program called 
upon the peasants to rise in revolution against the tsar and the landlords. 
The Mensheviks took up a different position. They advocated a 
program of municipalization. According to this program, the landed 
estates were not to be placed at the disposal of the village communities, 
not even given to the village communities for use, but were to be placed 
at the disposal of the municipalities (that is, the local organs of selfgovernment, 
or Zemstvos), and each peasant was to rent as much of this 
land as he could afford. 
The Menshevik program of municipalization was one of compromise, 
and therefore prejudicial to the revolution. It could not mobilize 
the peasants for a revolutionary struggle and was not designed to achieve 
the complete abolition of landlord property rights in land. The Menshevik 
program was designed to stop the revolution halfway. The Mensheviks 
did not want to rouse the peasants for revolution.

87 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
The Menshevik program received the majority of the votes at the 
congress. 
The Mensheviks particularly betrayed their anti-proletarian, opportunist 
nature during the discussion of the resolution on the current situation 
and on the State Duma. The Menshevik Martynov frankly spoke 
in opposition to the hegemony of the proletariat in the revolution. Comrade 
Stalin, replying to the Mensheviks, put the matter very bluntly: 
³Either the hegemony of the proletariat, or the hegemony of the 
democratic bourgeoisiethat is how the question stands in the Party, 
that is where we differ.² 
As to the State Duma, the Mensheviks extolled it in their resolution 
as the best means of solving the problems of the revolution and of liberating 
the people from tsardom. The Bolsheviks, on the contrary, regarded 
the Duma as an impotent appendage of tsardom, as a screen for the 
evils of tsardom, which the latter would discard as soon as it proved 
inconvenient. 
The Central Committee elected at the Fourth Congress consisted 
of three Bolsheviks and six Mensheviks. The editorial board of the 
central press organ was formed entirely of Mensheviks. 
It was clear that the internal Party struggle would continue. 
After the Fourth Congress the conflict between the Bolsheviks and 
the Mensheviks broke out with new vigour. In the local organizations, 
which were formally united, reports on the congress were often made 
by two speakers: one from the Bolsheviks and another from the Mensheviks. 
The result of the discussion of the two lines was that in most 
cases the majority of the members of the organizations sided with the 
Bolsheviks. 
Events proved that the Bolsheviks were right. The Menshevik Central 
Committee elected at the Fourth Congress increasingly revealed its 
opportunism and its utter inability to lead the revolutionary struggle of the 
masses. In the summer and autumn of 1906 the revolutionary struggle 
of the masses took on new vigour. Sailors¹ revolts broke out in Kronstadt 
and Sveaborg; the peasants¹ struggle against the landlords flared 
up. Yet the Menshevik Central Committee issued opportunist slogans, 
which the masses did not follow.

6. DISPERSION OF THE FIRST STATE DUMA. CONVOCATION OF THE 
SECOND STATE DUMA. FIFTH PARTY CONGRESS. DISPERSION OF 
THE SECOND STATE DUMA. CAUSES OF THE DEFEAT OF THE 
FIRST RUSSIAN REVOLUTION 
As the First State Duma did not prove docile enough, the tsarist government 
dispersed it in the summer of 1906. The government resorted 
to even more drastic repressions against the people, extended the ravaging 
activities of the punitive expeditions throughout the country, and announced 
its decision of shortly calling a Second State Duma. The tsarist 
government was obviously growing more insolent. It no longer feared 
the revolution, for it saw that the revolution was on the decline. 
The Bolsheviks had to decide whether to participate in the Second 
Duma or to boycott it. By boycott, the Bolsheviks usually meant an 
active boycott, and not the mere passive abstention from voting in the 
elections. The Bolsheviks regarded active boycott as a revolutionary 
means of warning the people against the attempts of the tsar to divert 
them from the path of revolution to the path of tsarist ³constitution,² 
as a means of frustrating these attempts and organizing a new onslaught 
of the people on tsardom. 
The experience of the boycott of the Bulygin Duma had shown that 
a boycott was ³the only correct tactics, as fully proved by events.² (Lenin, 
Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 393.) This boycott was successful because 
it not only warned the people against the danger of the path of tsarist 
constitutionalism but frustrated the very birth of the Duma. The boycott 
was successful because it was carried out during the rising tide of 
the revolution and was supported by this tide, and not when the revolution 
was receding. The summoning of the Duma could be frustrated 
only during the high tide of the revolution. 
The boycott of the Witte Duma, i.e., the First Duma, took place 
after the December uprising had been defeated, when the tsar proved 
to be the victor, that is, at a time when there was reason to believe that 
the revolution had begun to recede. 
³But,² wrote Lenin, ³it goes without saying that at that time 
there were as yet no grounds to regard this victory (of the tsarEd.) 
as a decisive victory. The uprising of December 1905 had its sequel 
in a series of disconnected and partial military uprisings and strikes 
in the summer of 1906. The call to boycott the Witte Duma was 
a call to concentrate these uprisings and make them general.² (Lenin, 
Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XII, p. 20.)

89 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
The boycott of the Witte Duma was unable to frustrate its convocation 
although it considerably undermined its prestige and weakened 
the faith of a part of the population in it. The boycott was unable to 
frustrate the convocation of the Duma because, as subsequently became 
clear, it took place at a time when the revolution was receding, when it 
was on the decline. For this reason the boycott of the First Duma in 
1906 was unsuccessful. In this connection Lenin wrote in his famous 
pamphlet, ³Left-Wing² Communism, An Infantile Disorder: 
³The Bolshevik boycott of parliament¹ in 1905 enriched the 
revolutionary proletariat with highly valuable political experience and 
showed that in combining legal with illegal, parliamentary with extraparliamentary 
forms of struggle, it is sometimes useful and even 
essential to reject parliamentary forms. . . . The boycott of the 
Duma¹ by the Bolsheviks in 1906 was however a mistake, although 
a small and easily remediable one. . . . What applies to individuals 
applieswith necessary modificationsto politics and parties. Not 
he is wise who makes no mistakes. There are no such men nor can 
there be. He is wise who makes not very serious mistakes and who 
knows how to correct them easily and quickly. (Lenin, Selected 
Works, Vol. X, p. 74.) 
As to the Second State Duma, Lenin held that in view of the changed 
situation and the decline of the revolution, the Bolsheviks ³must reconsider 
the question of boycotting the State Duma.² (Lenin, Selected 
Works, Vol. III, p. 392.) 
³History has shown,² Lenin wrote, ³that when the Duma assembles 
opportunities arise for carrying on useful agitation both from 
within the Duma and, in connection with it, outsidethat the tactics 
of joining forces with the revolutionary peasantry against the Constitutional-
Democrats can be applied in the Duma.² (Ibid., p. 396.) 
All this showed that one had to know not only how to advance 
resolutely, to advance in the front ranks, when the revolution was in 
the ascendant, but also how to retreat properly, to be the last to retreat, 
when the revolution was no longer in the ascendant, changing one¹s 
tactics as the situation changed; to retreat not in disorder, but in an organized 
way, calmly and without panic, utilizing every minute opportunity 
to withdraw the cadres from under enemy fire, to reform one¹s ranks to 
muster one¹s forces and to prepare for a new offensive against the enemy. 
The Bolsheviks decided to take part in the elections to the Second 
Duma.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 90 
But the Bolsheviks did not go to the Duma for the purpose of carrying 
on organic ³legislative² work inside it in a bloc with the Constitutional-
Democrats, as the Mensheviks did, but for the purpose of utilizing 
it as a platform in the interests of the revolution. 
The Menshevik Central Committee, on the contrary, urged that 
election agreements be formed with the Constitutional-Democrats, and 
that support be given to the Constitutional-Democrats in the Duma, for 
in their eyes the Duma was a legislative body that was capable of bridling 
the tsarist government. 
The majority of the Party organizations expressed themselves against 
the policy of the Menshevik Central Committee. 
The Bolsheviks demanded that a new Party congress be called. 
In May 1907 the Fifth Party Congress met in London. At the 
time of this congress the R.S.D.L.P. (together with the national Social- 
Democratic organizations) had a membership of nearly 150,000. In 
all, 336 delegates attended the congress, of whom 105 were Bolsheviks 
and 97 Mensheviks. The remaining delegates represented the national 
Social-Democratic organizationsthe Polish and Lettish Social-Democrats 
and the Bundwhich had been admitted into the R.S.D.L.P. 
at the previous congress. 
Trotsky tried to knock together a group of his own at the congress, 
a centrist, that is, semi-Menshevik, group, but could get no following. 
As the Bolsheviks had the support of the Poles and the Letts, they 
had a stable majority at the congress. 
One of the main questions at issue at the congress was that of policy 
towards the bourgeois parties. There had already been a struggle between 
the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks on this question at the Second 
Congress. The fifth Congress gave a Bolshevik estimate of all the nonproletarian 
partiesBlack-Hundreds, Octobrists (Union of October 
Seventeenth), Constitutional-Democrats and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and formulated the Bolshevik tactics to be pursued in regard to these 
parties. 
The congress approved the policy of the Bolsheviks and decided to 
wage a relentless struggle both against the Black-Hundred partiesthe 
League of the Russian People, the monarchists, the Council of the United 
Nobilityand against the Octobrists, the Commercial and Industrial 
Party and the Party of Peaceful Renovation. All these parties were 
outspokenly counter-revolutionary. 
As regards the liberal bourgeoisie, the Constitutional-Democratic 
Party, the congress recommended a policy of uncompromising exposure; 
the false and hypocritical ³democracy² of the Constitutional-Democratic

91 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
Party was to be exposed and the attempts of the liberal bourgeoisie to 
gain control of the peasant movement combated. 
As to the so-called Narodnik or Trudovik parties (the Popular Socialists, 
the Trudovik Group and the Socialist-Revolutionaries), the congress 
recommended that their attempts to mask themselves as Socialists 
be exposed. At the same time the congress considered it permissible now 
and then to conclude agreements with these parties for a joint and simultaneous 
attack on tsardom and the Constitutional-Democratic bourgeoisie, 
inasmuch as these parties were at that time democratic parties and expressed 
the interests of the petty bourgeoisie of town and country. 
Even before this congress, the Mensheviks had proposed that a socalled 
³labour congress² be convened. The Mensheviks¹ idea was to 
call a congress at which Social-Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionaries and 
Anarchists should all be represented. This ³labour² congress was to 
form something in the nature of a ³non-partisan party,² or a ³broad² 
petty-bourgeois labour party without a program. Lenin exposed this as 
a pernicious attempt on the part of the Mensheviks to liquidate the Social- 
Democratic Labour Party and to dissolve the vanguard of the working 
class in the petty-bourgeois mass. The congress vigorously condemned 
the Menshevik call for a ³labour congress.² 
Special attention was devoted at the congress to the subject of the 
trade unions. The Mensheviks advocated ³neutrality² of the trade 
unions; in other words, they were opposed to the Party playing a leading 
role in them. The congress rejected the Mensheviks¹ motion and 
adopted the resolution submitted by the Bolsheviks. This resolution 
stated that the Party must gain the ideological and political leadership in 
the trade unions. 
The Fifth Congress was a big victory for the Bolsheviks in the 
working-class movement. But the Bolsheviks did not allow this to turn 
their heads; nor did they rest on their laurels. That was not what Lenin 
taught them. The Bolsheviks knew that more fighting with the Mensheviks 
was still to come. 
In an article entitled ³Notes of a Delegate² which appeared in 1907, 
Comrade Stalin assessed the results of the congress as follows: 
³The actual unification of the advanced workers of all Russia 
into a single all-Russian party under the banner of revolutionary 
Social-Democracythat is the significance of the London Congress, 
that is its general character.² 
In this article Comrade Stalin cited data showing the composition of 
the congress. They show that the Bolshevik delegates were sent to the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 92 
congress chiefly by the big industrial centres (St. Petersburg, Moscow, 
the Urals, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, etc.), whereas the Mensheviks got their 
mandates from districts where small production prevailed, where artisans, 
semi-proletarians predominated, as well as from a number of purely 
rural areas. 
³Obviously,² says Comrade Stalin, summing up the results of the 
congress, ³the tactics of the Bolsheviks are the tactics of the proletarians 
in big industry, the tactics of those areas where the class 
contradictions are especially clear and the class struggle especially 
acute. Bolshevism is the tactics of the real proletarians. On the other 
hand, it is no less obvious that the tactics of the Mensheviks are primarily 
the tactics of the handicraft workers and the peasant semiproletarians, 
the tactics of those areas where the class contradictions 
are not quite clear and the class struggle is masked. Menshevism is 
the tactics of the semi-bourgeois elements among the proletariat. So 
say the figures.² (Verbatim Report of the Fifth Congress of the- 
R.S.D.L.P., Russ. ed., 1935, pp. xi and xii.) 
When the tsar dispersed the First Duma he expected that the Second 
Duma would be more docile. But the Second Duma, too, belied his 
expectations. The tsar thereupon decided to disperse it, too, and to 
convoke a Third Duma on a more restricted franchise, in the hope that 
this Duma would prove more amenable. 
Shortly after the Fifth Congress, the tsarist government effected 
what is known as the coup d¹état of June 3. On June 3, 1907, the tsar 
dispersed the Second State Duma. The sixty-five deputies of the Social- 
Democratic group in the Duma were arrested and exiled to Siberia. A 
new election law was promulgated. The rights of the workers and 
peasants were still further curtailed. The tsarist government continued 
its offensive. 
The tsar¹s Minister Stolypin intensified the campaign of bloody reprisals 
against the workers and peasants. Thousands of revolutionary 
workers and peasants were shot by punitive expeditions, or hanged. In 
the tsarist dungeons revolutionaries were tortured mentally and physically. 
Particularly savage was the persecution of the working-class organizations, 
especially the Bolsheviks. The tsar¹s sleuths were searching for Lenin, 
who was living in hiding in Finland. They wanted to wreak their vengeance 
on the leader of the revolution. In December 1907 Lenin managed 
at great risk to make his way abroad and again became an exile. 
The dark period of the Stolypin reaction set in. 
The first Russian revolution thus ended in defeat.

93 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
The causes that contributed to this defeat were as follows: 
1) In the revolution, there was still no stable alliance of the workers 
and peasants against tsardom. The peasants rose in struggle against the 
landlords and were willing to join in an alliance with the workers against 
them. But they did not yet realize that the landlords could not be overthrown 
unless the tsar were overthrown, they did not realize that the 
tsar was acting hand-in-hand with the landlords, and large numbers of 
the peasants still had faith in the tsar and placed their hopes in the tsarist 
State Duma. That is why a considerable section of the peasants were 
disinclined to join in alliance with the workers for the overthrow of 
tsardom. The peasants had more faith in the compromising Socialist- 
Revolutionary Party than in the real revolutionariesthe Bolsheviks. 
As a result, the struggle of the peasants against the landlords was not 
sufficiently organized. Lenin said: 
³The peasants¹ actions were too scattered, too unorganized 
and not sufficiently aggressive, and that was one of the fundamental 
causes of the defeat of the revolution.² (Lenin, Collected Works, 
Russ. ed., Vol. XIX, p. 354.) 
2) The disinclination of a large section of the peasants to join the 
workers for the overthrow of tsardom also influenced the conduct of the 
army, which largely consisted of peasants¹ sons clad in soldiers¹ uniforms. 
Unrest and revolt broke out in certain units of the tsar¹s army, but the 
majority of the soldiers still assisted the tsar in suppressing the strikes 
and uprisings of the workers. 
3) Neither was the action of the workers sufficiently concerted. 
The advanced sections of the working class started a heroic revolutionary 
struggle in 1905. The more backward sectionsthe workers in the less 
industrialized provinces, those who lived in the villagescame into action 
more slowly. Their participation in the revolutionary struggle became 
particularly active in 1906, but by then the vanguard of the working 
class had already been considerably weakened. 
4) The working class was the foremost and principal force of the 
revolution; but the necessary unity and solidarity in the ranks of the 
party of the working class were lacking. The R.S.D.L.P.the party 
of the working classwas split into two groups: the Bolsheviks and the 
Mensheviks. The Bolsheviks pursued a consistent revolutionary line and 
called upon the workers to overthrow tsardom. The Mensheviks, by 
their compromising tactics, hampered the revolution, confused the minds 
of large numbers of workers and split the working class. Therefore, the 
workers did not always act concertedly in the revolution, and the working

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 94 
class, still lacking unity within its own ranks, could not become the 
real leader of the revolution. 
5) The tsarist autocracy received help in crushing the Revolution of 
1905 from the West-European imperialists. The foreign capitalists 
feared for their investments in Russia and for their huge profits. Moreover, 
they feared that if the Russian revolution were to succeed the 
workers of other countries would rise in revolution, too. The West- 
European imperialists therefore came to the assistance of the hangmantsar. 
The French bankers granted a big loan to the tsar for the suppression 
of the revolution. The German kaiser kept a large army in 
readiness to intervene in aid of the Russian tsar. 
6) The conclusion of peace with Japan in September 1905 was of 
considerable help to the tsar. Defeat in the war and the menacing 
growth of the revolution had induced the tsar to hasten the signing of 
peace. The loss of the war weakened tsardom. The conclusion of 
peace strengthened the position of the tsar. 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
The first Russian revolution constituted a whole historical stage in 
the development of our country. This historical stage consisted of two 
periods: the first period, when the tide of revolution rose from the general 
political strike in October to the armed uprising in December and 
took advantage of the weakness of the tsar, who had suffered defeat on 
the battlefields of Manchuria, to sweep away the Bulygin Duma and 
wrest concession after concession from the tsar; and the second period, 
when tsardom, having recovered after the conclusion of peace with 
Japan, took advantage of the liberal bourgeoisie¹s fear of the revolution, 
took advantage of the vacillation of the peasants, cast them a sop in 
the form of the Witte Duma, and passed to the offensive against the 
working class, against the revolution. 
In the short period of only three years of revolution (1905-07) 
the working class and the peasantry received a rich political education, 
such as they could not have received in thirty years of ordinary peaceful 
development. A few years of revolution made clear what could not be 
made clear in the course of decades of peaceful development. 
The revolution disclosed that tsardom was the sworn enemy of the 
people, that tsardom was like the proverbial hunchback whom only the 
grave could cure. 
The revolution showed that the liberal bourgeoisie was seeing an

95 1 9 0 4 - 1 9 0 7 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
alliance with the tsar, and not with the people, that it was a counterrevolutionary 
force, an agreement with which would be tantamount to 
a betrayal of the people. 
The revolution showed that only the working class could be the 
leader of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, that it alone could force 
aside the liberal Constitutional-Democratic bourgeoisie, destroy its influence 
over the peasantry, rout the landlords, carry the revolution to its 
conclusion and clear the way for Socialism. 
Lastly, the revolution showed that the labouring peasantry, despite 
its vacillations, was the only important force capable of forming an 
alliance with the working class. 
Two lines were contending within the R.S.D.L.P. during the revolution, 
the line of the Bolsheviks and the line of the Mensheviks. The 
Bolsheviks took as their course the extension of the revolution, the overthrow 
of tsardom by armed uprising, the hegemony of the working class, 
the isolation of the Constitutional-Democratic bourgeoisie, an alliance 
with the peasantry, the formation of a provisional revolutionary government 
consisting of representatives of the workers and peasants, the victorious 
completion of the revolution. The Mensheviks, on the contrary, 
took as their course the liquidation of the revolution. Instead of overthrowing 
tsardom by uprising, they proposed to reform and ³improve² 
it; instead of the hegemony of the proletariat, they proposed the 
hegemony of the liberal bourgeoisie; instead of an alliance with the 
peasantry, they proposed an alliance with the Constitutional-Democratic 
bourgeoisie; instead of a provisional government, they proposed a State 
Duma as the centre of the ³revolutionary forces² of the country. 
Thus the Mensheviks sank into the morass of compromise and became 
vehicles of the bourgeois influence on the working class, virtual 
agents of the bourgeoisie within the working class. 
The Bolsheviks proved to be the only revolutionary Marxist force 
in the Party and the country. 
It was natural that, in view of such profound differences, the 
R.S.D.L.P. proved in fact to be split into two parties, the party of the 
Bolsheviks and the party of the Mensheviks. The Fourth Party Congress 
changed nothing in the actual state of affairs within the Party. It 
only preserved and somewhat strengthened formal unity in the Party. 
The Fifth Party Congress took a step towards actual unity in the Party, 
a unity achieved under the banner of Bolshevism. 
Reviewing the revolutionary movement, the Fifth Party Congress 
condemned the line of the Mensheviks as one of compromise, and approved 
the Bolshevik line as a revolutionary Marxist line. In doing so

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 96 
it once more confirmed what had already been confirmed by the whole 
course of the first Russian revolution. 
The revolution showed that the Bolsheviks knew how to advance 
when the situation demanded it, that they had learned to advance in the 
front ranks and to lead the whole people in attack. But the revolution 
also showed that the Bolsheviks knew how to retreat in an orderly way 
when the situation took an unfavourable turn, when the revolution was 
on the decline, and that the Bolsheviks had learned to retreat properly, 
without panic or commotion, so as to preserve their cadres, rally their 
forces, and, having reformed their ranks in conformity with the new 
situation, once again to resume the attack on the enemy. 
It is impossible to defeat the enemy without knowing how to attack 
properly. 
It is impossible to avoid utter rout in the event of defeat without 
knowing how to retreat properly, to retreat without panic and without 
confusion.

AND EMPIRIO-CRITICISM² AND HIS DEFENCE OF THE 
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE MARXIST PARTY 
The Second State Duma was dissolved by the tsarist government on 
June 3, 1907. This is customarily referred to in history as the coup 
d¹état of June 3. The tsarist government issued a new law on the elections 
to the Third State Duma, and thus violated its own Manifesto of 
October 17, 1905, which stipulated that new laws could be issued only 
with the consent of the Duma. The members of the Social-Democratic 
group in the Second Duma were committed for trial; the representatives 
of the working class were condemned to penal servitude and exile. 
The new election law was so drafted as to increase considerably the 
number of representatives of the landlords and the commercial and industrial 
bourgeoisie in the Duma. At the same time the representation 
of the peasants and workers, small as it was, was reduced to a fraction 
of its former size. 
Black-Hundreds and Constitutional-Democrats preponderated in 
the Third Duma. Of a total of 442 deputies, 171 were Rights (Black- 
Hundreds), 113 were Octobrists or members of kindred groups, 101 
were Constitutional-Democrats or members of kindred groups, 13 were 
Trudoviki, and 18 were Social-Democrats. 
The Rights (so called because they occupied the benches on the 
right-hand side of the Duma) represented the worst enemies of the 
workers and peasantsthe Black-Hundred feudal landlords, who had 
subjected the peasants to mass floggings and shootings during the sup- 
97

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 98 
pression of the peasant movement, and organizers of Jewish pogroms, of 
the manhandling of demonstrating workers and of the brutal burning of 
premises where meetings were being held during the revolution. The 
Rights stood for the most ruthless suppression of the working people, 
and for the unlimited power of the tsar; they were opposed to the 
tsar¹s Manifesto of October 17, 1905. 
The Octobrist Party, or the Union of October Seventeenth, closely 
adhered to the Rights in the Duma. The Octobrists represented the 
interests of big industrial capital, and of the big landlords who ran their 
estates on capitalist lines (at the beginning of the Revolution of 1905 a 
large number of the big landlords belonging to the Constitutional-Democratic 
Party went over to the Octobrists). The only thing that distinguished 
the Octobrists from the Rights was their acceptanceonly in 
words at thatof the Manifesto of October 17. The Octobrists fully 
supported both the home and foreign policy of the tsarist government. 
The Constitutional-Democratic Party had fewer seats in the Third 
Duma than in the First and Second Dumas. This was due to the transfer 
of part of the landlord vote from the Constitutional-Democrats to 
the Octobrists. 
There was a small group of petty-bourgeois democrats, known as 
Trudoviki, in the Third Duma. They vacillated between the Constitutional-
Democrats and the labour democrats (Bolsheviks). Lenin pointed 
out that although the Trudoviki in the Duma were extremely weak, 
they represented the masses, the peasant masses. The vacillation of the 
Trudoviki between the Constitutional-Democrats and the labour democrats 
was an inevitable consequence of the class position of the small 
owners. Lenin set before the Bolshevik deputies, the labour democrats, 
the task of ³helping the weak petty-bourgeois democrats, of wresting 
them from the influence of the liberals, of rallying the democratic camp 
against the counter-revolutionary Constitutional-Democrats, and not 
only against the Rights. . . .² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. 
XV, p. 486.) 
During the Revolution of 1905, and especially after its defeat, the 
Constitutional-Democrats increasingly revealed themselves as a counterrevolutionary 
force. Discarding their ³democratic² mask more and 
more, they acted like veritable monarchists, defenders of tsardom. In 
1909 a group of prominent Constitutional-Democrat writers published a 
volume of articles entitled Vekhi (Landmarks) in which, on behalf of 
the bourgeoisie, they thanked the tsar for crushing the revolution. 
Cringing and fawning upon the tsarist government, the government of the 
knout and the gallows, the Constitutional-Democrats bluntly stated

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
in this book that ³we should bless this government, which alone, with its 
bayonets and jails, protects us (the liberal bourgeoisie) from the ire of 
the people.² 
Having dispersed the Second State Duma and disposed of the Social- 
Democratic group of the Duma, the tsarist government zealously set 
about destroying the political and economic organizations of the proletariat. 
Convict prisons, fortresses and places of exile were filled to overflowing 
with revolutionaries. They were brutally beaten up in the 
prisons, tormented and tortured. The Black-Hundred terror raged unchecked. 
The tsar¹s Minister Stolypin set up gallows all over the country. 
Several thousand revolutionaries were executed. In those days 
the gallows was known as the ³Stolypin necktie.² 
In its efforts to crush the revolutionary movement of the workers 
and peasants the tsarist government could not confine itself to acts of 
repression, punitive expeditions, shootings, jailings and sentences of penal 
servitude. It perceived with alarm that the naive faith of the peasants 
in ³the little father, the tsar² was steadily vanishing. It therefore resorted 
to a broad manoeuvre. It conceived the idea of creating a solid 
support for itself in the countryside, in the large class of rural bourgeoisie 
the kulaks. 
On November 9, I906, Stolypin issued a new agrarian law enabling 
the peasants to leave the communes and to set up separate farms. 
Stolypin¹s agrarian law broke down the system of communal land tenure. 
The peasants were invited to take possession of their allotments as private 
property and to withdraw from the communes. They could now sell 
their allotments, which they were not allowed to do before. When a 
peasant left his commune the latter was obliged to allot land to him in 
a single tract (khutor, otrub). 
The rich peasants, the kulaks, now had the opportunity to buy up 
the land of the poor peasants at low prices. Within a few years after the 
promulgation of the law, over a million poor peasants had lost their land 
altogether and had been completely ruined. As the poor peasants lost 
their land the number of kulak farmholds grew. These were sometimes 
regular estates employing hired labourfarm handson a large scale. 
The government compelled the peasants to allot the best land of the 
communes to the kulak farmers. 
During the ³emancipation² of the peasants the landlords had 
robbed the peasants of their land; now the kulaks began to rob the 
communes of their land, securing the best plots and buying up the allotments 
of poor peasants at low prices. 
The tsarist government advanced large loans to the kulaks for the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 100 
purchase of land and the outfitting of their farms. Stolypin wanted to 
turn the kulaks into small landlords, into loyal defenders of the tsarist 
autocracy. 
In the nine years 1906-15 alone, over two million households withdrew 
from the communes. 
As a result of the Stolypin policy the condition of the peasants with 
small land allotments, and of the poor peasants, grew worse than ever. 
The process of differentiation among the peasantry became more marked. 
The peasants began to come into collision with the kulak farmers. 
At the same time, the peasants began to realize that they would 
never gain possession of the landed estates as long as the tsarist government 
and the State Duma of the landlords and Constitutional-Democrats 
existed. 
During the period when kulak farmholds were being formed in 
large numbers (1907-09), the peasant movement began to decline, but 
soon after, in 1910, 1911, and later, owing to the clashes between the 
members of the village communes and the kulak farmers, the peasant 
movement against the landlords and the kulak farmers grew in intensity. 
There were big changes also in industry after the revolution. The 
concentration of industry in the hands of increasingly powerful capitalist 
groups proceeded much more rapidly. Even before the Revolution of 
1905, the capitalists had begun to form associations with the object 
of raising prices within the country and of using the super-profits thus 
obtained for the encouragement of export trade so as to enable them to 
dump goods abroad at low prices and to capture foreign markets. These 
capitalist associations (monopolies) were called trusts and syndicates. 
After the revolution their number became still greater. There was also 
an increase in the number of big banks, whose role in industry became 
more important. The flow of foreign capital into Russia increased. 
Thus capitalism in Russia was turning into monopoly capitalism, 
imperialist capitalism, on a growing scale. 
After several years of stagnation, industry began to revive: the output 
of coal, metal, oil, textiles and sugar increased. Grain exports 
assumed large dimensions. 
Although Russia at that time made some industrial progress, she was 
still backward compared with Western Europe, and still dependent on 
foreign capitalists. Russia did not produce machinery and machine tools 
they were imported from abroad. She had no automobile industry or 
chemical industry; she did not produce artificial fertilizers. Russia also 
lagged behind other capitalist countries in the manufacture of armaments.

101 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
Pointing to the low level of consumption of metals in Russia as an 
indication of the country¹s backwardness, Lenin wrote: 
³In the half-century following the emancipation of the peasants 
the consumption of iron in Russia has increased five-fold; yet Russia 
remains an incredibly and unprecedentedly backward country, 
poverty-stricken and semi-barbaric, equipped with modern implements 
of production to one-fourth the extent of England, one-fifth the 
extent of Germany, and one-tenth the extent of America.² (Lenin, 
Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XVI, p. 543.) 
O ne dire ct r e sult of Russia¹s economic and political backwardness was 
the dependence both of Russian capitalism and of tsardom itself on 
West-European capitalism. 
This found expression in the fact that such highly important branches 
of industry as coal, oil, electrical equipment, and metallurgy were in the 
hands of foreign capital, and that tsarist Russia had to import nearly all 
her machinery and equipment from abroad. 
It also found expression in the fettering foreign loans. To pay interest 
on these loans tsardom squeezed hundreds of millions of rubles 
out of the people annually. 
It moreover found expression in the secret treaties with Russia¹s 
³allies,² by which the tsarist government undertook in the event of war 
to send millions of Russian soldiers to support the ³allies² on the imperialist 
fronts and to protect the tremendous profits of the British and 
French capitalists. 
The period of the Stolypin reaction was marked by particularly 
savage assaults on the working class by the gendarmerie and police, 
the tsarist agents-provocateurs and Black-Hundred ruffians. But it 
was not only the underlings of the tsar who harassed and persecuted 
the workers. No less zealous in this respect were the factory and mill 
owners, whose offensive against the working class became particularly 
aggressive in the years of industrial stagnation and increasing unemployment. 
The factory owners declared mass lockouts and drew up black 
lists of class-conscious workers who took an active part in strikes. Once 
a person was blacklisted he could never hope to find employment in any 
of the plants belonging to the manufacturers¹ association in that particular 
branch of industry. Already in 1908 wage rates were cut by 10 to 15 
per cent. The working day was everywhere increased to 10 or 12 
hours. The system of rapacious fines again flourished. 
The defeat of the Revolution of 1905 started a process of disintegration 
and degeneration in the ranks of the fellow-travelers of the rev

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 102 
olution. Degenerate and decadent tendencies grew particularly marked 
among the intelligentsia. The fellow-travelers who came from the bourgeois 
camp to join the movement during the upsurge of the revolution 
deserted the Party in the days of reaction. Some of them joined the 
camp of the open enemies of the revolution, others entrenched themselves 
in such legally functioning working-class societies as still survived, 
and endeavoured to divert the proletariat from the path of revolution 
and to discredit the revolutionary party of the proletariat. Deserting the 
revolution the fellow-travelers tried to win the good graces of the 
reactionaries and to live in peace with tsardom. 
The tsarist government took advantage of the defeat of the revolution 
to enlist the more cowardly and self-seeking fellow-travelers of the 
revolution as agents-provocateurs. These vile Judases were sent by the 
tsarist Okhrana into the working class and Party organizations, where 
they spied from within and betrayed revolutionaries. 
The offensive of the counter-revolution was waged on the ideological 
front as well. There appeared a whole horde of fashionable writers 
who ³criticized² Marxism, and ³demolished² it, mocked and scoffed 
at the revolution, extolled treachery, and lauded sexual depravity under 
the guise of the ³cult of individuality.² 
In the realm of philosophy increasing attempts were made to ³criticize² 
and revise Marxism; there also appeared all sorts of religious 
trends camouflaged by pseudo-scientific theories. 
³Criticizing² Marxism became fashionable. 
All these gentlemen, despite their multifarious colouring, pursued one 
common aim: to divert the masses from the revolution. 
Decadence and scepticism also affected a section of the Party intelligentsia, 
those who considered themselves Marxists but had never held 
firmly to the Marxist position. Among them were writers like Bogdanov, 
Bazarov, Lunacharsky (who had sided with the Bolsheviks in 1905), 
Yushkevich and Valentinov (Mensheviks). They launched their ³criticism² 
simultaneously against the philosophical foundations of Marxist 
theory, i.e., against dialectical materialism, and against the fundamental 
Marxist principles of historical science, i.e., against historical materialism. 
This criticism differed from the usual criticism in that it was not conducted 
openly and squarely, but in a veiled and hypocritical form under 
the guise of ³defending² the fundamental positions of Marxism. These 
people claimed that in the main they were Marxists, but that they wanted 
to ³improve² Marxismby ridding it of certain of its fundamental principles. 
In reality, they were hostile to Marxism, for they tried to undermine 
its theoretical foundations, although they hypocritically denied their

103 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
hostility to Marxism and two-facedly continued to style themselves Marxists. 
The danger of this hypocritical criticism lay in the fact that it was 
calculated to deceive rank-and-file members of the Party and might lead 
them astray. The more hypocritical grew this criticism, which aimed at 
undermining the theoretical foundations of Marxism, the more dangerous 
it was to the Party, for the more it merged with the general campaign of 
the reactionaries against the Party, against the revolution. Some of the 
intellectuals who had deserted Marxism went so far as to advocate the 
founding of a new religion (these were known as ³god-seekers² and 
³god-builders²). 
It became urgent for the Marxists to give a fitting retort to these 
renegades from Marxist theory, to tear the mask from their faces and 
thoroughly expose them, and thus safeguard the theoretical foundations 
of the Marxist Party. 
One might have thought that this task would have been undertaken 
by Plekhanov and his Menshevik friends who regarded themselves as 
³eminent Marxist theoreticians.² But they preferred to fire off one or 
two insignificant critical notes of the newspaper type and quit the field. 
It was Lenin who accomplished this task in his famous book Materialism 
and Empirio-Criticism, published in 1909. 
³In the course of less than half a year,² Lenin wrote, ³four books 
devoted mainly and almost entirely to attacks on dialectical materialism 
have made their appearance. These include first and foremost 
Studies in (?it would have been more proper to say against¹) the 
Philosophy of Marxism (St. Petersburg, 1908), a symposium by 
Bazarov, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Berman, Helfond, Yushkevich 
and Suvorov; Yushkevich¹s Materialism and Critical Realism; Berman¹s 
Dialectics in the Light of the Modern Theory of Knowledge 
and Valentinov¹s The Philosophic Constructions of Marxism. . . . All 
these people, who, despite the sharp divergence of their political views, 
are united in their hostility toward dialectical materialism, at the 
same time claim to be Marxists in philosophy! Engels¹ dialectics is 
mysticism,¹ says Berman. Engels¹ views have become antiquated,¹ 
remarks Bazarov casually, as though it were a self-evident fact. 
Materialism thus appears to be refuted by our bold warriors, who 
proudly allude to the modern theory of knowledge,¹ recent philosophy¹ 
(or recent positivism¹), the philosophy of modern natural 
science,¹ or even the philosophy of natural science of the twentieth 
century.¹² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. XI, p. 89.) 
Replying to Lunacharsky, who, in justification of his friendsthe

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 104 
revisionists in philosophysaid, ³perhaps we have gone astray, but we 
are seeking,² Lenin wrote: 
³As for myself, I too am a seeker¹ in philosophy. Namely, the 
task I have set myself in these comments (i.e., Materialism and Empirio-
CriticismEd.) is to find out what was the stumbling block 
to these people who under the guise of Marxism are offering something 
incredibly muddled, confused and reactionary.² (Ibid., p. 90.) 
But as a matter of fact, Lenin¹s book went far beyond this modest 
task. Actually, the book is something more than a criticism of Bogdanov, 
Yushkevich, Bazarov and Valentinov and their teachers in philosophy, 
Avenarius and Mach, who endeavoured in their writings to offer a refined 
and polished idealism as opposed to Marxist materialism; it is at 
the same time a defence of the theoretical foundations of Marxism 
dialectical and historical materialismand a materialist generalization of 
everything important and essential acquired by science, and especially the 
natural sciences, in the course of a whole historical period, the period 
from Engels¹ death to the appearance of Lenin¹s Materialism and Empirio-
Criticism. 
Having effectively criticized in this book the Russian empirio-criticists 
and their foreign teachers, Lenin comes to the following conclusions 
regarding philosophical and theoretical revisionism: 
1) ³An ever subtler falsification of Marxism, an ever subtler 
presentation of anti-materialist doctrines under the guise of Marxism 
this is the characteristic feature of modern revisionism in political 
economy, in questions of tactics and in philosophy generally.² (Ibid., 
p. 382.) 
2) ³The whole school of Mach and Avenarius is moving towards 
idealism.² (Ibid., p. 406.) 
3) ³Our Machians have all got stuck in idealism.² (Ibid., p. 
396.)
4) ³Behind the gnosiological scholasticism of empirio-criticism 
it is impossible not to see the struggle of parties in philosophy, a struggle 
which in the last analysis expresses the tendencies and ideology 
of the antagonistic classes in modern society.² (Ibid., p. 407.) 
5) ³The objective, class role of empirio-criticism reduces itself to 
nothing but that of servitor of the fideists (the reactionaries who hold 
faith above scienceEd.) in their struggle against materialism in 
general and historical materialism in particular.² (Ibid., p. 407.) 
6) ³Philosophical idealism is . . . a road to clerical obscurantism.² 
(Ibid., p. 84.)

105 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
In order to appreciate the tremendous part played by Lenin¹s book 
in the history of our Party and to realize what theoretical treasure Lenin 
safeguarded from the motley crowd of revisionists and renegades of the 
period of the Stolypin reaction, we must acquaint ourselves, if only 
briefly, with the fundamentals of dialectical and historical materialism. 
This is all the more necessary because dialectical and historical 
materialism constitute the theoretical basis of Communism, the theoretical 
foundations of the Marxist party, and it is the duty of every active member 
of our Party to know these principles and hence to study them. 
What, then, is 
1) Dialectical materialism? 
2) Historical materialism? 
2. DIALECTICAL AND HISTORICAL MATERIALISM 
Dialectical materialism is the world outlook of the Marxist-Leninist 
party. It is called dialectical materialism because its approach to the 
phenomena of nature, its method of studying and apprehending them, 
is dialectical, while its interpretation of the phenomena of nature, its conception 
of these phenomena, its theory, is materialistic. 
Historical materialism is the extension of the principles of dialectical 
materialism to the study of social life, an application of the principles of 
dialectical materialism to the phenomena of the life of society, to the 
study of society and its history. 
When describing their dialectical method, Marx and Engels usually 
refer to Hegel as the philosopher who formulated the main features of 
dialectics. This, however, does not mean that the dialectics of Marx and 
Engels is identical with the dialectics of Hegel. As a matter of fact, 
Marx and Engels took from the Hegelian dialectics only its ³rational 
kernel,² casting aside its idealistic shell, and developed it further so 
as to lend it a modern scientific form. 
³My dialectic method,² says Marx, ³is fundamentally not only 
different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the 
process of thinking, which, under the name of the Idea,¹ he even 
transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurge (creator) 
of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal 
form of the Idea.¹ With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing 
else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated 
into forms of thought.² (Karl Marx, Capital, Vol, I, p. xxx, 
International Publishers, 1939.) 
When describing their materialism, Marx and Engels usually refer

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 106 
to Feuerbach as the philosopher who restored materialism to its rights. 
This, however, does not mean that the materialism of Marx and Engels 
is identical with Feuerbach¹s materialism. As a matter of fact, Marx and 
Engels took from Feuerbach¹s materialism its ³inner kernel,² developed 
it into a scientific-philosophical theory of materialism and cast aside 
its idealistic and religious-ethical encumbrances. We know that Feuerbach, 
although he was fundamentally a materialist, objected to the name 
materialism. Engels more than once declared that ³in spite of the materialist 
foundation, Feuerbach remained bound by the traditional idealist 
fetters,² and that ³the real idealism of Feuerbach becomes evident as 
soon as we come to his philosophy of religion and ethics.² (Karl Marx, 
Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. 439, 442.) 
Dialectics comes from the Greek dialego, to discourse, to debate. In 
ancient times dialectics was the art of arriving at the truth by disclosing 
the contradictions in the argument of an opponent and overcoming these 
contradictions. There were philosophers in ancient times who believed 
that the disclosure of contradictions in thought and the clash of opposite 
opinions was the best method of arriving at the truth. This dialectical 
method of thought, later extended to the phenomena of nature, developed 
into the dialectical method of apprehending nature, which regards 
the phenomena of nature as being in constant movement and undergoing 
constant change, and the development of nature as the result of the 
development of the contradictions in nature, as the result of the interaction 
of opposed forces in nature. 
In its essence, dialectics is the direct opposite of metaphysics. 
1) The principal features of the Marxist dialectical method are as 
follows: 
a) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics does not regard nature as an 
accidental agglomeration of things, of phenomena, unconnected with, 
isolated from, and independent of, each other, but as a connected and 
integral whole, in which things, phenomena, are organically connected 
with, dependent on, and determined by, each other. 
The dialectical method therefore holds that no phenomenon in nature 
can be understood if taken by itself, isolated from surrounding phenomena, 
inasmuch as any phenomenon in any realm of nature may become 
meaningless to us if it is not considered in connection with the 
surrounding conditions, but divorced from them; and that, vice versa, 
any phenomenon can be understood and explained if considered in its 
inseparable connection with surrounding phenomena, as one conditioned 
by surrounding phenomena. 
b) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics holds that nature is not a state 
of rest and immobility, stagnation and immutability, but a state of con

107 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
tinuous movement and change, of continuous renewal and development, 
where something is always arising and developing, and something always 
disintegrating and dying away. 
The dialectical method therefore requires that phenomena should 
be considered not only from the standpoint of their interconnection and 
interdependence, but also from the standpoint of their movement, their 
change, their development, their coming into being and going out of 
being. 
The dialectical method regards as important primarily not that which 
at the given moment seems to be durable and yet is already beginning 
to die away, but that which is arising and developing, even though at 
the given moment it may appear to be not durable, for the dialectical 
method considers invincible only that which is arising and developing. 
³All nature,² says Engels, ³from the smallest thing to the biggest, 
from a grain of sand to the sun, from the protista (the primary 
living cellEd.) to man, is in a constant state of coming into being 
and going out of being, in a constant flux, in a ceaseless state of 
movement and change.² (F. Engels, Dialectics of Nature.) 
Therefore, dialectics, Engels says, ³takes things and their perceptual 
images essentially in their inter-connection, in their concatenation, in 
their movement, in their rise and disappearance.² (Ibid.) 
c) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics does not regard the process of 
development as a simple process of growth, where quantitative changes 
do not lead to qualitative changes, but as a development which passes 
from insignificant and imperceptible quantitative changes to open, fundamental 
changes, to qualitative changes; a development in which 
the qualitative changes occur not gradually, but rapidly and abruptly, 
taking the form of a leap from one state to another; they occur not 
accidentally but as the natural result of an accumulation of imperceptible 
and gradual quantitative changes. 
The dialectical method therefore holds that the process of development 
should be understood not as movement in a circle, not as a simple 
repetition of what has already occurred, but as an onward and upward 
movement, as a transition from an old qualitative state to a new qualitative 
state, as a development from the simple to the complex, from the 
lower to the higher: 
³Nature,² says Engels, ³is the test of dialectics, and it must be 
said for modern natural science that it has furnished extremely rich 
and daily increasing materials for this test, and has thus proved that 
in the last analysis nature¹s process is dialectical and not metaphysical,

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 108 
that it does not move in an eternally uniform and constantly repeated 
circle, but passes through a real history. Here prime mention should 
be made of Darwin, who dealt a severe blow to the metaphysical 
conception of nature by proving that the organic world of today, 
plants and animals, and consequently man too, is all a product of 
a process of development that has been in progress for millions of 
years.² (F. Engels, Anti-Dühring.) 
Describing dialectical development as a transition from quantitative 
changes to qualitative changes, Engels says: 
³In physics . . . every change is a passing of quantity into quality, 
as a result of quantitative change of some form of movement either 
inherent in a body or imparted to it. For example, the temperature 
of water has at first no effect on its liquid state; but as the temperature 
of liquid water rises or falls, a moment arrives when this state of 
cohesion changes and the water is converted in one case into steam 
and in the other into ice. . . . A definite minimum current is required 
to make a platinum wire glow; every metal has its melting temperature; 
every liquid has a definite freezing point and boiling point 
at a given pressure, as far as we are able with the means at our 
disposal to attain the required temperatures; finally, every gas has 
its critical point at which, by proper pressure and cooling, it can be 
converted into a liquid state. . . . What are known as the constants 
of physics (the point at which one state passes into anotherEd.) 
are in most cases nothing but designations for the nodal points at 
which a quantitative (change) increase or decrease of movement 
causes a qualitative change in the state of the given body, and at 
which, consequently, quantity is transformed into quality.² (Dialectics 
of Nature.) 
Passing to chemistry, Engels continues: 
³Chemistry may be called the science of the qualitative changes 
which take place in bodies as the effect of changes of quantitative 
composition. This was already known to Hegel. . . . Take oxygen: 
if the molecule contains three atoms instead of the customary two, 
we get ozone, a body definitely distinct in odour and reaction from 
ordinary oxygen. And what shall we say of the different proportions 
in which oxygen combines with nitrogen or sulphur, and each 
of which produces a body qualitatively different from all other 
bodies!² (Ibid.) 
Finally, criticizing Dühring, who scolded Hegel for all he was worth, 
but surreptitiously borrowed from him the well-known thesis that the

109 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
transition from the insentient world to the sentient world, from the 
kingdom of inorganic matter to the kingdom of organic life, is a leap 
to a new state, Engels says: 
³This is precisely the Hegelian nodal line of measure relations, in 
which, at certain definite nodal points, the purely quantitative increase 
or decrease gives rise to a qualitative leap for example, in the case 
of water which is heated or cooled, where boiling-point and freezingpoint 
are the nodes at whichunder normal pressurethe leap to 
a new aggregate state takes place, and where consequently quantity 
is transformed into quality.² (F. Engels, Anti-Dühring.) 
d) Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics holds that internal contradictions 
are inherent in all things and phenomena of nature, for they all 
have their negative and positive sides, a past and a future, something 
dying away and something developing; and that the struggle between 
these opposites, the struggle between the old and the new, between that 
which is dying away and that which is being born, between that which is 
disappearing and that which is developing, constitutes the internal content 
of the process of development, the internal content of the transformation 
of quantitative changes into qualitative changes. 
The dialectical method therefore holds that the process of development 
from the lower to the higher takes place not as a harmonious unfolding 
of phenomena, but as a disclosure of the contradictions inherent 
in things and phenomena, as a ³struggle² of opposite tendencies which 
operate on the basis of these contradictions. 
³In its proper meaning,² Lenin says, ³dialectics is the study of 
the contradiction within the very essence of things.² (Lenin, Philosophical 
Notebooks, Russ. ed., p. 263.) 
And further: 
³Development is the struggle¹ of opposites.² (Lenin, Selected 
Works, Vol. XI, pp. 81-2.) 
Such, in brief, are the principal features of the Marxist dialectical 
method. 
It is easy to understand how immensely important is the extension of 
the principles of the dialectical method to the study of social life and the 
history of society, and how immensely important is the application of 
these principles to the history of society and to the practical activities of 
the party of the proletariat. 
If there are no isolated phenomena in the world, if all phenomena 
are interconnected and interdependent, then it is clear that every social 
system and every social movement in history must be evaluated not from

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 110 
the standpoint of ³eternal justice² or some other preconceived idea, as is 
not infrequently done by historians, but from the standpoint of the conditions 
which gave rise to that system or that social movement and with 
which they are connected. 
The slave system would be senseless, stupid and unnatural under 
modern conditions. But under the conditions of a disintegrating primitive 
communal system, the slave system is a quite understandable and 
natural phenomenon, since it represents an advance on the primitive 
communal system. 
The demand for a bourgeois-democratic republic when tsardom and 
bourgeois society existed, as, let us say, in Russia in 1905, was a quite 
understandable, proper and revolutionary demand, for at that time a 
bourgeois republic would have meant a step forward. But now, under 
the conditions of the U.S.S.R., the demand for a bourgeois-democratic 
republic would be a meaningless and counter-revolutionary demand, for 
a bourgeois republic would be a retrograde step compared with the Soviet 
republic. 
Everything depends on the conditions, time and place. 
It is clear that without such a historical approach to social phenomena, 
the existence and development of the science of history is impossible, for 
only such an approach saves the science of history from becoming a 
jumble of accidents and an agglomeration of most absurd mistakes. 
Further, if the world is in a state of constant movement and development, 
if the dying away of the old and the upgrowth of the new is a 
law of development, then it is clear that there can be no ³immutable² 
social systems, no ³eternal principles² of private property and exploitation, 
no ³eternal ideas² of the subjugation of the peasant to the landlord, 
of the worker to the capitalist. 
Hence the capitalist system can be replaced by the Socialist system, 
just as at one time the feudal system was replaced by the capitalist system. 
Hence we must not base our orientation on the strata of society which 
are no longer developing, even though they at present constitute the predominant 
force, but on those strata which are developing and have a 
future before them, even though they at present do not constitute the 
predominant force. 
In the eighties of the past century, in the period of the struggle between 
the Marxists and the Narodniks, the proletariat in Russia constituted 
an insignificant minority of the population, whereas the individual 
peasants constituted the vast majority of the population. But the proletariat 
was developing as a class, whereas the peasantry as a class was disintegrating. 
And just because the proletariat was developing as a class the

111 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
Marxists based their orientation on the proletariat. And they were not 
mistaken, for, as we know, the proletariat subsequently grew from an insignificant 
force into a first-rate historical and political force. 
Hence, in order not to err in policy, one must look forward, not 
backward. 
Further, if the passing of slow quantitative changes into rapid and 
abrupt qualitative changes is a law of development, then it is clear that 
revolutions made by oppressed classes are a quite natural and inevitable 
phenomenon. 
Hence the transition from capitalism to Socialism and the liberation 
of the working class from the yoke of capitalism cannot be effected by 
slow changes, by reforms, but only by a qualitative change of the capitalist 
system, by revolution. 
Hence, in order not to err in policy, one must be a revolutionary, 
not a reformist. 
Further, if development proceeds by way of the disclosure of internal 
contradictions, by way of collisions between opposite forces on the basis 
of these contradictions and so as to overcome these contradictions, then it 
is clear that the class struggle of the proletariat is a quite natural and inevitable 
phenomenon. 
Hence we must not cover up the contradictions of the capitalist system, 
but disclose and unravel them; we must not try to check the class 
struggle but carry it to its conclusion. 
Hence, in order not to err in policy, one must pursue an uncompromising 
proletarian class policy, not a reformist policy of harmony of the 
interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, not a compromisers¹ 
policy of ³the growing of capitalism into Socialism.² 
Such is the Marxist dialectical method when applied to social life, to 
the history of society. 
As to Marxist philosophical materialism, it is fundamentally the direct 
opposite of philosophical idealism. 
2) The principal features of Marxist philosophical materialism a re as 
follows: 
a) Contrary to idealism, which regards the world as the embodiment 
of an ³absolute idea,² a ³universal spirit,² ³consciousness,² Marx¹s philosophical 
materialism holds that the world is by its very nature material, 
that the multifold phenomena of the world constitute different forms of 
matter in motion, that interconnection and interdependence of phenomena, 
as established by the dialectical method, are a law of the development 
of moving matter, and that the world develops in accordance with the 
laws of movement of matter and stands in no need of a ³universal spirit.²

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 112 
³The materialist world outlook,² says Engels, ³is simply the conception 
of nature as it is, without any reservations.² (MS of Ludwig 
Feuerbach.) 
Speaking of the materialist views of the ancient philosopher Heraclitus, 
who held that ³the world, the all in one, was not created by any 
god or any man, but was, is and ever will be a living flame, systematically 
flaring up and systematically dying down,² Lenin comments: ³A very 
good exposition of the rudiments of dialectical materialism.² (Lenin, 
Philosophical Notebooks, Russ. ed., p. 318.) 
b) Contrary to idealism, which asserts that only our mind really exists, 
and that the material world, being, nature, exists only in our mind, in 
our sensations, ideas and perceptions, the Marxist materialist philosophy 
holds that matter, nature, being, is an objective reality existing outside 
and independent of our mind; that matter is primary, since it is the source 
of sensations, ideas, mind, and that mind is secondary, derivative, since it 
is a reflection of matter, a reflection of being; that thought is a product 
of matter which in its development has reached a high degree of perfection, 
namely, of the brain, and the brain is the organ of thought; and 
that therefore one cannot separate thought from matter without committing 
a grave error. Engels says: 
³The question of the relation of thinking to being, the relation 
of spirit to nature is the paramount question of the whole of philosophy. 
. . . The answers which the philosophers gave to this question 
split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primacy of 
spirit to nature . . . comprised the camp of idealism. The others, who 
regarded nature as primary, belong to the various schools of materialism.² 
(Karl Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. 430-31.) 
And further: 
³The material, sensuously perceptible world to which we ourselves 
belong is the only reality. . . . Our consciousness and thinking, however 
supra-sensuous they may seem, are the product of a material, 
bodily organ, the brain. Matter is not a product of mind, but mind 
itself is merely the highest product of matter.² (Ibid., p. 435.) 
Concerning the question of matter and thought, Marx says: 
³It is impossible to separate thought from matter that thinks. 
Matter is the subject of all changes.² (Ibid., p. 397.) 
Describing the Marxist philosophy of materialism, Lenin says: 
³Materialism in general recognizes objectively real being (matter) 
as independent of consciousness, sensation, experience. . . . Consciousness 
is only the reflection of being, at best, an approximately true

113 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
(adequate, ideally exact) reflection of it.² (Lenin, Selected Works, 
Vol. XI, p. 378.) 
And further: 
(a) ³Matter is that which, acting upon our sense-organs, produces 
sensation; matter is the objective reality given to us in sensation. . . . 
Matter, nature, being, the physicalis primary, and spirit, consciousness, 
sensation, the psychicalis secondary.² (Ibid., pp. 208, 209.) 
(b) ³The world picture is a picture of how matter moves and of 
how matter thinks.¹² (Ibid., p. 403.) 
(c) ³The brain is the organ of thought.² (Ibid., p. 125.) 
c) Contrary to idealism, which denies the possibility of knowing the 
world and its laws, which does not believe in the authenticity of our 
knowledge, does not recognize objective truth, and holds that the world 
is full of ³things-in-themselves² that can never be known to science, 
Marxist philosophical materialism holds that the world and its laws are 
fully knowable, that our knowledge of the laws of nature, tested by experiment 
and practice, is authentic knowledge having the validity of objective 
truth, and that there are no things in the world which are 
unknowable, but only things which are still not known, but which will be 
disclosed and made known by the efforts of science and practice. 
Criticizing the thesis of Kant and other idealists that the world is 
unknowable and that there are ³things-in-themselves² which are unknowable, 
and defending the well-known materialist thesis that our 
knowledge is authentic knowledge, Engels writes: 
³The most telling refutation of this as of all other philosophical 
fancies is practice, viz., experiment and industry. If we are able to 
prove the correctness of our conception of a natural process by making 
it ourselves, bringing it into being out of its conditions and using it 
for our own purposes into the bargain, then there is an end of the 
Kantian thing-in-itself.¹ The chemical substances produced in the 
bodies of plants and animals remained such things-in-themselves¹ until 
organic chemistry began to produce them one after another, whereupon 
the thing-in-itself¹ became a thing for us, as for instance, alizarin, 
the colouring matter of the madder, which we no longer trouble to 
grow in the madder roots in the field, but produce much more cheaply 
and simply from coal tar. For three hundred years the Copernican 
solar system was a hypothesis, with a hundred, a thousand or ten 
thousand chances to one in its favour, but still always a hypothesis. 
But when Leverrier, by means of the data provided by this system, 
not only deduced the necessity of the existence of an unknown planet, 
but also calculated the position in the heavens which this planet must

DISTRIBUTION 
necessarily occupy, and when Galle really found this planet, the 
Copernican system was proved.² (Karl Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. 
432-33.) 
Accusing Bogdanov, Bazarov, Yushkevich and the other followers of 
Mach of fideism, and defending the well-known materialist thesis that 
our scientific knowledge of the laws of nature is authentic knowledge, 
and that the laws of science represent objective truth, Lenin says: 
³Contemporary fideism does not at all reject science; all it rejects 
is the exaggerated claims¹ of science, to wit, its claim to objective 
truth. If objective truth exists (as the materialists think), if 
natural science, reflecting the outer world in human experience,¹ is 
alone capable of giving us objective truth, then all fideism is absolutely 
refuted.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. XI, p. I89.) 
Such, in brief, are the characteristic features of the Marxist philosophical 
materialism. 
It is easy to understand how immensely important is the extension of 
the principles of philosophical materialism to the study of social life, of the 
history of society, and how immensely important is the application of these 
principles to the history of society and to the practical activities of the 
party of the proletariat. 
If the connection between the phenomena of nature and their interdependence 
are laws of the development of nature, it follows, too, that 
the connection and interdependence of the phenomena of social life are 
laws of the development of society, and not something accidental. 
Hence social life, the history of society, ceases to be an agglomeration of 
³accidents,² and becomes the history of the development of society according 
to regular laws, and the study of the history of society becomes a science. 
Hence the practical activity of the party of the proletariat must not 
be based on the good wishes of ³outstanding individuals,² not on the 
dictates of ³reason,² ³universal morals,² etc., but on the laws of development 
of society and on the study of these laws. 
Further, if the world is knowable and our knowledge of the laws of 
development of nature is authentic knowledge, having the validity of 
objective truth, it follows that social life, the development of society, is 
also knowable, and that the data of science regarding the laws of development 
of society are authentic data having the validity of objective truths. 
Hence the science of the history of society, despite all the complexity 
of the phenomena of social life, can become as precise a science as, let us 
say, biology, and capable of making use of the laws of development of 
society for practical purposes.

115 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
Hence the party of the proletariat should not guide itself in its practical 
activity by casual motives, but by the laws of development of society, 
and by practical deductions from these laws. 
Hence Socialism is converted from a dream of a better future for 
humanity into a science. 
Hence the bond between science and practical activity, between theory 
and practice, their unity, should be the guiding star of the party of the 
proletariat. 
Further, if nature, being, the material world, is primary, and mind, 
thought, is secondary, derivative; if the material world represents objective 
reality existing independently of the mind of men, while the mind is 
a reflection of this objective reality, it follows that the material life of 
society, its being, is also primary, and its spiritual life secondary, derivative, 
and that the material life of society is an objective reality existing independently 
of the will of men, while the spiritual life of society is a reflection 
of this objective reality, a reflection of being. 
Hence the source of formation of the spiritual life of society, the origin 
of social ideas, social theories, political views and political institutions, 
should not be sought for in the ideas, theories, views and political institutions 
themselves, but in the conditions of the material life of society, in 
social being, of which these ideas, theories, views, etc., are the reflection. 
Hence, if in different periods of the history of society different social 
ideas, theories, views and political institutions are to be observed; if under 
the slave system we encounter certain social ideas, theories, views and 
political institutions, under feudalism others, and under capitalism others 
still, this is not to be explained by the ³nature,² the ³properties² of the 
ideas, theories, views and political institutions themselves but by the different 
conditions of the material life of society at different periods of social 
development. 
Whatever is the being of a society, whatever are the conditions of 
material life of a society, such are the ideas, theories, political views and 
political institutions of that society. 
In this connection, Marx says: 
³It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, 
but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.² 
(Karl Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 356.) 
Hence, in order not to err in policy, in order not to find itself in the 
position of idle dreamers, the party of the proletariat must not base its 
activities on abstract ³principles of human reason,² but on the concrete 
conditions of the material life of society, as the determining force of social

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 116 
development; not on the good wishes of ³great men,² but on the real 
needs of development of the material life of society. 
The fall of the utopians, including the Narodniks, Anarchists and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries, was due, among other things, to the fact that 
they did not recognize the primary role which the conditions of the material 
life of society play in the development of society, and, sinking to 
idealism, did not base their practical activities on the needs of the development 
of the material life of society, but, independently of and in spite 
of these needs, on ³ideal plans² and ³all-embracing projects² divorced 
from the real life of society. 
The strength and vitality of Marxism-Leninism lie in the fact that 
it does base its practical activity on the needs of the development of the 
material life of society and never divorces itself from the real life of society. 
It does not follow from Marx¹s words, however, that social ideas, 
theories, political views and political institutions are of no significance 
in the life of society, that they do not reciprocally affect social being, 
the development of the material conditions of the life of society. We have 
been speaking so far of the origin of social ideas, theories, views and political 
institutions, of the way they arise, of the fact that the spiritual life 
of society is a reflection of the conditions of its material life. As regards 
the significance of social ideas, theories, views and political institutions, as 
regards their role in history, historical materialism, far from denying 
them, stresses the role and importance of these factors in the life of society, 
in its history. 
There are different kinds of social ideas and theories. There are old 
ideas and theories which have outlived their day and which serve the 
interests of the moribund forces of society. Their significance lies in the 
fact that they hamper the development, the progress of society. Then 
there are new and advanced ideas and theories which serve the interests 
of the advanced forces of society. Their significance lies in the fact that 
they facilitate the development, the progress of society; and their significance 
is the greater the more accurately they reflect the needs of development 
of the material life of society. 
New social ideas and theories arise only after the development of the 
material life of society has set new tasks before society. But once they 
have arisen they become a most potent force which facilitates the carrying 
out of the new tasks set by the development of the material life of society, 
a force which facilitates the progress of society. It is precisely here that 
the tremendous organizing, mobilizing and transforming value of new 
ideas, new theories, new political views and new political institutions 
manifests itself. New social ideas and theories arise precisely because they

117 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
are necessary to society, because it is impossible to carry out the urgent 
tasks of development of the material life of society without their organizing, 
mobilizing and transforming action. Arising out of the new tasks 
set by the development of the material life of society, the new social ideas 
and theories force their way through, become the possession of the masses, 
mobilize and organize them against the moribund forces of society, and 
thus facilitate the overthrow of these forces which hamper the development 
of the material life of society. 
Thus social ideas, theories and political institutions, having arisen on 
the basis of the urgent tasks of the development of the material life of 
society, the development of social being, themselves then react upon social 
being, upon the material life of society, creating the conditions necessary 
for completely carrying out the urgent tasks of the material life of society, 
and for rendering its further development possible. 
In this connection, Marx says: 
³Theory becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the 
masses.² (Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie.) 
Hence, in order to be able to influence the conditions of material life 
of society and to accelerate their development and their improvement, the 
party of the proletariat must rely upon such a social theory, such a social 
idea as correctly reflects the needs of development of the material life of 
society, and which is therefore capable of setting into motion broad masses 
of the people and of mobilizing them and organizing them into a great 
army of the proletarian party, prepared to smash the reactionary forces 
and to clear the way for the advanced forces of society. 
The fall of the ³Economists² and Mensheviks was due among other 
things to the fact that they did not recognize the mobilizing, organizing 
and transforming role of advanced theory, of advanced ideas and, sinking 
to vulgar materialism, reduced the role of these factors almost to 
nothing, thus condemning the Party to passivity and inanition. 
The strength and vitality of Marxism-Leninism are derived from the 
fact that it relies upon an advanced theory which correctly reflects the 
needs of development of the material life of society, that it elevates theory 
to a proper level, and that it deems it its duty to utilize every ounce of 
the mobilizing, organizing and transforming power of this theory. 
That is the answer historical materialism gives to the question of the 
relation between social being and social consciousness, between the conditions 
of development of material life and the development of the 
spiritual life of society. 
It now remains to elucidate the following question: what, from the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 118 
viewpoint of historical materialism, is meant by the ³conditions of material 
life of society² which in the final analysis determine the physiognomy of 
society, its ideas, views, political institutions, etc.? 
What, after all, are these ³conditions of material life of society,² 
what are their distinguishing features? 
There can be no doubt that the concept ³conditions of material life 
of society² includes, first of all, nature which surrounds society, geographical 
environment, which is one of the indispensable and constant 
conditions of material life of society and which, of course, influences the 
development of society. What role does geographical environment play 
in the development of society? Is geographical environment the chief 
force determining the physiognomy of society, the character of the social 
system of men, the transition from one system to another? 
Historical materialism answers this question in the negative. 
Geographical environment is unquestionably one of the constant and 
indispensable conditions of development of society and, of course, influences 
the development of society, accelerates or retards its development. 
But its influence is not the determining influence, inasmuch as the 
changes and development of society proceed at an incomparably faster 
rate than the changes and development of geographical environment. In 
the space of three thousand years three different social systems have been 
successively superseded in Europe: the primitive communal system, the 
slave system and the feudal system. In the eastern part of Europe, in the 
U.S.S.R., even four social systems have been superseded. Yet during 
this period geographical conditions in Europe have either not changed at 
all, or have changed so slightly that geography takes no note of them. 
And that is quite natural. Changes in geographical environment of any 
importance require millions of years, whereas a few hundred or a couple 
of thousand years are enough for even very important changes in the 
system of human society. 
It follows from this that geographical environment cannot be the 
chief cause, the determining cause of social development, for that which 
remains almost unchanged in the course of tens of thousands of years 
cannot be the chief cause of development of that which undergoes fundamental 
changes in the course of a few hundred years. 
Further, there can be no doubt that the concept ³conditions of material 
life of society² also includes growth of population, density of population 
of one degree or another, for people are an essential element of the 
conditions of material life of society, and without a definite minimum 
number of people there can be no material life of society. Is not growth 
of population the chief force that determines the character of the social 
system of man?

119 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
Historical materialism answers this question too in the negative. 
Of course, growth of population does influence the development of 
society, does facilitate or retard the development of society, but it cannot 
be the chief force of development of society, and its influence on the 
development of society cannot be the determining influence because, by 
itself, growth of population does not furnish the clue to the question why 
a given social system is replaced precisely by such and such a new system 
and not by another, why the primitive communal system is succeeded 
precisely by the slave system, the slave system by the feudal system, and 
the feudal system by the bourgeois system, and not by some other. 
If growth of population were the determining force of social development, 
then a higher density of population would be bound to give rise 
to a correspondingly higher type of social system. But we do not find 
this to be the case. The density of population in China is four times as 
great as in the U.S.A., yet the U.S.A. stands higher than China in the 
scale of social development, for in China a semi-feudal system still prevails, 
whereas the U.S.A. has long ago reached the highest stage of development 
of capitalism. The density of population in Belgium is 
nineteen times as great as in the U.S.A., and twenty-six times as great as 
in the U.S.S.R. Yet the U.S.A. stands higher than Belgium in the scale 
of social development; and as for the U.S.S.R., Belgium lags a whole 
historical epoch behind this country, for in Belgium the capitalist system 
prevails, whereas the U.S.S.R. has already done away with capitalism and 
has set up a Socialist system. 
It follows from this that growth of population is not, and cannot 
be, the chief force of development of society, the force which determines 
the character of the social system, the physiognomy of society. 
What, then, is the chief force in the complex of conditions of material 
life of society which determines the physiognomy of society, the 
character of the social system, the development of society from one system 
to another? 
This force, historical materialism holds, is the method of procuring 
the means of life necessary for human existence, the mode of production 
of material valuesfood, clothing, footwear, houses, fuel, instruments 
of production, etc.which are indispensable for the life of development 
of society. 
In order to live, people must have food, clothing, footwear, shelter, 
fuel, etc.; in order to have these material values, people must produce 
them; and in order to produce them, people must have the instruments of 
production with which food, clothing, footwear, shelter, fuel, etc., are 
produced; they must be able to produce these instruments and to use them.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 120 
The instruments of production wherewith material values are produced, 
the people who operate the instruments of production and carry 
on the production of material values thanks to a certain production experience 
and labour skillall these elements jointly constitute the productive 
forces of society. 
But the productive forces are only one aspect of production, only one 
aspect of the mode of production, an aspect that expresses the relation of 
men to the objects and forces of nature which they make use of for the 
production of material values. Another aspect of production, another 
aspect of the mode of production, is the relation of men to each other 
in the process of production, men¹s relations of production. Men carry 
on a struggle against nature and utilize nature for the production of 
material values not in isolation from each other, not as separate individuals, 
but in common, in groups, in societies. Production, therefore, is at 
all times and under all conditions social production. In the production of 
material values men enter into mutual relations of one kind or another 
within production, into relations of production of one kind or another. 
These may be relations of co-operation and mutual help between people 
who are free from exploitation; they may be relations of domination and 
subordination; and, lastly, they may be transitional from one form of 
relations of production to another. But whatever the character of the relations 
of production may be, always and in every system, they constitute 
just as essential an element of production as the productive forces of society. 
³In production,² Marx says, ³men not only act on nature but 
also on one another. They produce only by co-operating in a certain 
way and mutually exchanging their activities. In order to produce, 
they enter into definite connections and relations with one another 
and only within these social connections and relations does their action 
on nature, does production, take place.² (Karl Marx, Selected Works, 
Vol. I, p. 264.) 
Consequently, production, the mode of production, embraces both the 
productive forces of society and men¹s relations of production, and is thus the 
embodiment of their unity in the process of production of material values. 
One of the features of production is that it never stays at one point 
for a long time and is always in a state of change and development, and 
that, furthermore, changes in the mode of production inevitably call forth 
changes in the whole social system, social ideas, political views and political 
institutionsthey call forth a reconstruction of the whole social and political 
order. At different stages of development people make use of different 
modes of production, or, to put it more crudely, lead different manners

121 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
of life. In the primitive commune there is one mode of production, under 
slavery there is another mode of production, under feudalism a third mode 
of production, and so on. And, correspondingly, men¹s social system, 
the spiritual life of men, their views and political institutions also vary. 
Whatever is the mode of production of a society, such in the main is 
the society itself, its ideas and theories, its political views and institutions. 
Or, to put it more crudely, whatever is man¹s manner of life, such 
is his manner of thought. 
This means that the history of development of society is above all the 
history of the development of production, the history of the modes of 
production which succeed each other in the course of centuries, the history of 
the development of productive forces and people¹s relations of production. 
Hence the history of social development is at the same time the history 
of the producers of material values themselves, the history of the labouring 
masses who are the chief force in the process of production and who carry 
on the production of material values necessary for the existence of society. 
Hence, if historical science is to be a real science, it can no longer 
reduce the history of social development to the actions of kings and generals, 
to the actions of ³conquerors² and ³subjugators² of states, but must above 
all devote itself to the history of the producers of material values, the 
history of the labouring masses, the history of peoples. 
Hence the clue to the study of the laws of history of society must not 
be sought in men¹s minds, in the views and ideas of society, but in the 
mode of production practised by society in any given historical period; it 
must be sought in the economic life of society. 
Hence the prime task of historical science is to study and disclose the 
laws of production, the laws of development of the productive forces and 
of the relations of production, the laws of economic development of society. 
Hence, if the party of the proletariat is to be a real party, it must 
above all acquire a knowledge of the laws of development of production, 
of the laws of economic development of society. 
Hence, if it is not to err in policy, the party of the proletariat must 
both in drafting its program and in its practical activities proceed primarily 
from the laws of development of production, from the laws of economic 
development of society. 
A second feature of production is that its changes and development 
always begin with changes and development of the productive forces, 
and, in the first place, with changes and development of the instruments 
of production. Productive forces are therefore the most mobile and revolutionary 
element of production. First the productive forces of society 
change and develop, and then, depending on these changes and in con

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 122 
formity with them, men¹s relations of production, their economic relations, 
change. This, however, does not mean that the relations of production 
do not influence the development of the productive forces and that the 
latter are not dependent on the former. While their development is dependent 
on the development of the productive forces, the relations of production 
in their turn react upon the development of the productive forces, 
accelerating or retarding it. In this connection it should be noted that 
the relations of production cannot for too long a time lag behind and be 
in a state of contradiction to the growth of the productive forces, inasmuch 
as the productive forces can develop in full measure only when the relations 
of production correspond to the character, the state of the productive 
forces and allow full scope for their development. Therefore, however 
much the relations of production may lag behind the development of the 
productive forces, they must, sooner or later, come into correspondence 
withand actually do come into correspondence withthe level of development 
of the productive forces, the character of the productive forces. 
Otherwise we would have a fundamental violation of the unity of the 
productive forces and the relations of production within the system of 
production, a disruption of production as a whole, a crisis of production, 
a destruction of productive forces. 
An instance in which the relations of production do not correspond to 
the character of the productive forces, conflict with them, is the economic 
crises in capitalist countries, where private capitalist ownership of the 
means of production is in glaring incongruity with the social character 
of the process of production, with the character of the productive forces. 
This results in economic crises, which lead to the destruction of productive 
forces. Furthermore, this incongruity itself constitutes the economic 
basis of social revolution, the purpose of which is to destroy the existing 
relations of production and to create new relations of production corresponding 
to the character of the productive forces. 
In contrast, an instance in which the relations of production completely 
correspond to the character of the productive forces is the Socialist national 
economy of the U.S.S.R., where the social ownership of the means of 
production fully corresponds to the social character of the process of production, 
and where, because of this, economic crises and the destruction 
of productive forces are unknown. 
Consequently, the productive forces are not only the most mobile and 
revolutionary element in production, but are also the determining element 
in the development of production. 
Whatever are the productive forces such must be the relations of 
production.

123 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
While the state of the productive forces furnishes an answer to the 
questionwith what instruments of production do men produce the material 
values they need?the state of the relations of production furnishes 
the answer to another questionwho owns the means of production (the 
land, forests, waters, mineral resources, raw materials, instruments of 
production, production premises, means of transportation and communication, 
etc.), who commands the means of production, whether the whole 
of society, or individual persons, groups, or classes which utilize them for 
the exploitation of other persons, groups or classes? 
Here is a rough picture of the development of productive forces from 
ancient times to our day. The transition from crude stone tools to the 
bow and arrow, and the accompanying transition from the life of hunters 
to the domestication of animals and primitive pasturage; the transition 
from stone tools to metal tools (the iron axe, the wooden plough fitted 
ith an iron colter, etc.), with a corresponding transition to tillage and 
agriculture; a further improvement in metal tools for the working up of 
materials, the introduction of the blacksmith¹s bellows, the introduction 
of pottery, with a corresponding development of handicrafts, the separation 
of handicrafts from agriculture, the development of an independent handicraft 
industry and, subsequently, of manufacture; the transition from 
handicraft tools to machines and the transformation of handicraft and 
manufacture into machine industry; the transition to the machine system 
and the rise of modern large-scale machine industrysuch is a general 
and far from complete picture of the development of the productive forces 
of society in the course of man¹s history. It will be clear that the development 
and improvement of the instruments of production were effected 
by men who were related to production, and not independently of men; 
and, consequently, the change and development of the instruments of 
production were accompanied by a change and development of men, as 
the most important element of the productive forces, by a change and 
development of their production experience, their labour skill, their ability 
to handle the instruments of production. 
In conformity with the change and development of the productive 
forces of society in the course of history, men¹s relations of production, 
their economic relations also changed and developed. 
Five main types of relations of production are known to history: primitive 
communal, slave, feudal, capitalist and Socialist. 
The basis of the relations of production under the primitive communal 
system is that the means of production are socially owned. This in the 
main corresponds to the character of the productive forces of that period. 
Stone tools, and, later, the bow and arrow, precluded the possibility of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 124 
men individually combating the forces of nature and beasts of prey. In 
order to gather the fruits of the forest, to catch fish, to build some sort 
of habitation, men were obliged to work in common if they did not 
want to die of starvation, or fall victim to beasts of prey or to neighbouring 
societies. Labour in common led to the common ownership of the 
means of production, as well as of the fruits of production. Here the conception 
of private ownership of the means of production did not yet exist, 
except for the personal ownership of certain implements of production 
which were at the same time means of defence against beasts of prey. 
Here there was no exploitation, no classes. 
The basis of the relations of production under the slave system is that 
the slave owner owns the means of production; he also owns the worker 
in productionthe slave, whom he can sell, purchase, or kill as though 
he were an animal. Such relations of production in the main correspond 
to the state of the productive forces of that period. Instead of stone tools, 
men now have metal tools at their command; instead of the wretched and 
primitive husbandry of the hunter, who knew neither pasturage, nor tillage, 
there now appear pasturage, tillage, handicrafts, and a division of labour 
between these branches of production. There appears the possibility of the 
exchange of products between individuals and between societies, of the 
accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few, the actual accumulation of 
the means of production in the hands of a minority, and the possibility of 
subjugation of the majority by a minority and their conversion into slaves. 
Here we no longer find the common and free labour of all members of 
society in the production processhere there prevails the forced labour 
of slaves, who are exploited by the non-labouring slave owners. Here, 
therefore, there is no common ownership of the means of production or 
of the fruits of production. It is replaced by private ownership. Here the 
slave owner appears as the prime and principal property owner in the full 
sense of the term. 
Rich and poor, exploiters and exploited, people with full rights and 
people with no rights, and a fierce class struggle between themsuch is 
the picture of the slave system. 
The basis of the relations of production under the feudal system is 
that the feudal lord owns the means of production and does not fully own 
the worker in productionthe serf, whom the feudal lord can no longer 
kill, but whom he can buy and sell. Alongside of feudal ownership there 
exists individual ownership by the peasant and the handicraftsman of his 
implements of production and his private enterprise based on his personal 
labour. Such relations of production in the main correspond to the state 
of the productive forces of that period. Further improvements in the

125 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
smelting and working of iron; the spread of the iron plough and the 
loom; the further development of agriculture, horticulture, viniculture 
and dairying; the appearance of manufactories alongside of the handicraft 
workshopssuch are the characteristic features of the state of the 
productive forces. 
The new productive forces demand that the labourer shall display 
some kind of initiative in production and an inclination for work, an 
interest in work. The feudal lord therefore discards the slave, as a labourer 
who has no interest in work and is entirely without initiative, and prefers 
to deal with the serf, who has his own husbandry, implements of production, 
and a certain interest in work essential for the cultivation of the land 
and for the payment in kind of a part of his harvest to the feudal lord. 
Here private ownership is further developed. Exploitation is nearly 
as severe as it was under slaveryit is only slightly mitigated. A class 
struggle between exploiters and exploited is the principal feature of the 
feudal system. 
The basis of the relations of production under the capitalist system is 
that the capitalist owns the means of production, but not the workers in 
productionthe wage labourers, whom the capitalist can neither kill nor 
sell because they are personally free, but who are deprived of means of 
production and, in order not to die of hunger, are obliged to sell their 
labour power to the capitalist and to bear the yoke of exploitation. Alongside 
of capitalist property in the means of production, we find, at first on 
a wide scale, private property of the peasants and handicraftsmen in the 
means of production, these peasants and handicraftsmen no longer being 
serfs, and their private property being based on personal labour. In 
place of the handicraft workshops and manufactories there appear huge 
mills and factories equipped with machinery. In place of the manorial 
estates tilled by the primitive implements of production of the peasant, 
there now appear large capitalist farms run on scientific lines and supplied 
with agricultural machinery. 
The new productive forces require that the workers in production 
shall be better educated and more intelligent than the downtrodden and 
ignorant serfs, that they be able to understand machinery and operate it 
properly. Therefore, the capitalists prefer to deal with wage workers who 
are free from the bonds of serfdom and who are educated enough to be 
able properly to operate machinery. 
But having developed productive forces to a tremendous extent, 
capitalism has become enmeshed in contradictions which it is unable to 
solve. By producing larger and larger quantities of commodities, and 
reducing their prices, capitalism intensifies competition, ruins the mass of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 126 
small and medium private owners, converts them into proletarians and 
reduces their purchasing power, with the result that it becomes impossible 
to dispose of the commodities produced. On the other hand, by expanding 
production and concentrating millions of workers in huge mills and factories, 
capitalism lends the process of production a social character and 
thus undermines its own foundation, inasmuch as the social character of 
the process of production demands the social ownership of the means of 
production; yet the means of production remain private capitalist property, 
which is incompatible with the social character of the process of 
production. 
These irreconcilable contradictions between the character of the productive 
forces and the relations of production make themselves felt in 
periodical crises of overproduction, when the capitalists, finding no effective 
demand for their goods owing to the ruin of the mass of the population 
which they themselves have brought about, are compelled to burn products, 
destroy manufactured goods, suspend production, and destroy productive 
forces at a time when millions of people are forced to suffer unemployment 
and starvation, not because there are not enough goods, but because 
there is an overproduction of goods. 
This means that the capitalist relations of production have ceased to 
correspond to the state of productive forces of society and have come 
into irreconcilable contradiction with them. 
This means that capitalism is pregnant with revolution, whose mission 
it is to replace the existing capitalist ownership of the means of production 
by Socialist ownership. 
This means that the main feature of the capitalist system is a most 
acute class struggle between the exploiters and the exploited. 
The basis of the relations of production under the Socialist system, 
which so far has been established only in the U.S.S.R., is the social ownership 
of the means of production. Here there are no longer exploiters and 
exploited. The goods produced are distributed according to labour performed, 
on the principle: ³He who does not work, neither shall he eat.² 
Here the mutual relations of people in the process of production are marked 
by comradely co-operation and the Socialist mutual assistance of workers 
who are free from exploitation. Here the relations of production fully 
correspond to the state of productive forces, for the social character of 
the process of production is reinforced by the social ownership of the 
means of production. 
For this reason Socialist production in the U.S.S.R. knows no periodical 
crises of overproduction and their accompanying absurdities. 
For this reason, the productive forces here develop at an accelerated

127 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
pace, for the relations of production that correspond to them offer full 
scope for such development. 
Such is the picture of the development of men¹s relations of production 
in the course of human history. 
Such is the dependence of the development of the relations of production 
on the development of the production forces of society, and 
primarily, on the development of the instruments of production, the dependence 
by virtue of which the changes and development of the productive 
forces sooner or later lead to corresponding changes and development of 
the relations of production. 
³The use and fabrication of instruments of labour,²* says Marx, 
³although existing in the germ among certain species of animals, is 
specifically characteristic of the human labour-process, and Franklin 
therefore defines man as a tool-making animal. Relics of bygone 
instruments of labour possess the same importance for the investigation 
of extinct economic forms of society, as do fossil bones for the 
determination of extinct species of animals. It is not the articles made, 
but how they are made, and by what instruments that enables us to 
distinguish different economic epochs. . . . Instruments of labour not 
only supply a standard of the degree of development to which human 
labour has attained but they are also indicators of the social conditions 
under which that labour is carried on.² (Karl Marx, Capital, Vol. I, 
p, 159.) 
And further: 
a) ³Social relations are closely bound up with productive forces. 
In acquiring new productive forces men change their mode of production; 
and in changing their mode of production, in changing the way 
of earning their living, they change all their social conditions. The 
hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society 
with the industrial capitalist.² (Karl Marx, The Poverty of Philosophy, 
p. 92.) 
b) ³There is a continual movement of growth in productive forces, 
of destruction in social relations, of formation in ideas; the only immutable 
thing is the abstraction of movement.² (Ibid., p. 93.) 
Speaking of historical materialism as formulated in The Communist 
Manifesto, Engels says: 
³Economic production and the structure of society of every historical 
epoch necessarily arising therefrom constitute the foundation for 
* By instruments of labour Marx has in mind primarily instruments of production.Ed.

the political and intellectual history of that epoch; . . . consequently 
ever since the dissolution of the primeval communal ownership of 
land all history has been a history of class struggles, of struggles 
between exploited and exploiting, between dominated and dominating 
classes at various stages of social evolution; . . . this struggle, however, 
has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed class 
(the proletariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the class which 
exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), without at the same time 
forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation, oppression and 
class struggles.² (Preface to the German edition of The Communist 
ManifestoKarl Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. I92-93.) 
A third feature of production is that the rise of new productive forces 
and of the relations of production corresponding to them does not take 
place separately from the old system, after the disappearance of the old 
system, but within the old system; it takes place not as a result of the 
deliberate and conscious activity of man, but spontaneously, unconsciously, 
independently of the will of man. It takes place spontaneously and independently 
of the will of man for two reasons. 
First, because men are not free to choose one mode of production 
or another, because as every new generation enters life it finds productive 
forces and relations of production already existing as the result of the work 
of former generations, owing to which it is obliged at first to accept and 
adapt itself to everything it finds ready made in the sphere of production 
in order to be able to produce material values. 
Secondly, because, when improving one instrument of production 
or another, one element of the productive forces or another, men do not 
realize, do not understand or stop to reflect what social results these 
improvements will lead to, but only think of their everyday interests, of 
lightening their labour and of securing some direct and tangible advantage 
for themselves. 
When, gradually and gropingly, certain members of primitive communal 
society passed from the use of stone tools to the use of iron tools, 
they, of course, did not know and did not stop to reflect what social results 
this innovation would lead to; they did not understand or realize that 
the change to metal tools meant a revolution in production, that it would 
in the long run lead to the slave system. They simply wanted to lighten 
their labour and secure an immediate and tangible advantage; their conscious 
activity was confined within the narrow bounds of this everyday 
personal interest. 
When, in the period of the feudal system, the young bourgeoisie of

129 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
Europe began to erect, alongside of the small guild workshops, large 
manufactories, and thus advanced the productive forces of society, it, of 
course, did not know and did not stop to reflect what social consequences 
this innovation would lead to; it did not realize or understand that this 
³small² innovation would lead to a regrouping of social forces which 
was to end in a revolution both against the power of kings, whose favours 
it so highly valued, and against the nobility, to whose ranks its foremost 
representatives not infrequently aspired. It simply wanted to lower the 
cost of producing goods, to throw large quantities of goods on the markets 
of Asia and of recently discovered America, and to make bigger profits. 
Its conscious activity was confined within the narrow bounds of this commonplace 
practical aim. 
When the Russian capitalists, in conjunction with foreign capitalists, 
energetically implanted modern large-scale machine industry in Russia, 
while leaving tsardom intact and turning the peasants over to the tender 
mercies of the landlords, they, of course, did not know and did not stop 
to reflect what social consequences this extensive growth of productive 
forces would lead to, they did not realize or understand that this big leap 
in the realm of the productive forces of society would lead to a regrouping 
of social forces that would enable the proletariat to effect a union with 
the peasantry and to bring about a victorious Socialist revolution. They 
simply wanted to expand industrial production to the limit, to gain control 
of the huge home market, to become monopolists, and to squeeze as much 
profit as possible out of the national economy. Their conscious activity 
did not extend beyond their commonplace, strictly practical interests. Accordingly, 
Marx says: 
³In the social production which men carry on (that is, in the 
production of the material values necessary to the life of menEd.) 
they enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent* 
of their will; these relations of production correspond to a 
definite stage of development of their material forces of production.² 
(Karl Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 356.) 
This, however, does not mean that changes in the relations of production, 
and the transition from old relations of production to new 
relations of production proceed smoothly, without conflicts, without upheavals. 
On the contrary, such a transition usually takes place by means 
of the revolutionary overthrow of the old relations of production and the 
establishment of new relations of production. Up to a certain period the 
development of the productive forces and the changes in the realm of 
* Our italics.Ed.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 130 
the relations of production proceed spontaneously, independently of the will 
of men. But that is so only up to a certain moment, until the new and developing 
productive forces have reached a proper state of maturity. 
After the new productive forces have matured, the existing relations of 
production and their upholdersthe ruling classesbecome that ³insuperable² 
obstacle which can only be removed by the conscious action of the new 
classes, by the forcible acts of these classes, by revolution. Here there 
stands out in bold relief the tremendous role of new social ideas, of new 
political institutions, of a new political power, whose mission it is to abolish 
by force the old relations of production. Out of the conflict between the 
new productive forces and the old relations of production, out of the new 
economic demands of society there arise new social ideas; the new ideas 
organize and mobilize the masses; the masses become welded into a new 
political army, create a new revolutionary power, and make use of it to 
abolish by force the old system of relations of production, and firmly to 
establish the new system. The spontaneous process of development 
yields place to the conscious actions of men, peaceful development to violent 
upheaval, evolution to revolution. 
³The proletariat,² says Marx, ³during its contest with the bourgeoisie 
is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself 
as a class . . . by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, 
and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production.² 
(The Communist ManifestoKarl Marx, Selected Works, Vol. I, 
p. 228.) 
And further: 
a) ³The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by 
degrees, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments 
of production in the hands of the state, i.e., of the proletariat organized 
as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as 
rapidly as possible.² (Ibid., p. 227.) 
b) ³Force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new 
one.² (Karl Marx, Capital, Vol. I, p. 776.) 
Here is the brilliant formulation of the essence of historical materialism 
given by Marx in 1859 in his historic Preface to his famous book, Critique 
of Political Economy: 
³In the social production which men carry on they enter into 
definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will; 
these relations of production correspond to a definite stage of development 
of their material forces of production. The sum total of these 
relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society

131 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure 
and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The 
mode of production in material life determines the social, political and 
intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men 
that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being 
that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of their development, 
the material forces of production in society come in conflict 
with the existing relations of production, orwhat is but a legal expression 
for the same thingwith the property relations within which 
they have been at work before. From forms of development of the 
forces of production these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins 
an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic 
foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly 
transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should 
always be made between the material transformation of the economic 
conditions of production which can be determined with the precision 
of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, esthetic or philosophic
in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious 
of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our opinion of an individual 
is not based on what he thinks of himself, so can we not judge of 
such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the 
contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions 
of material life, from the existing conflict between the 
social forces of production and the relations of production. No social 
order ever disappears before all the productive forces for which there 
is room in it have been developed; and new higher relations of production 
never appear before the material conditions of their existence 
have matured in the womb of the old society itself. Therefore, mankind 
always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking 
at the matter more closely, we will always find that the task itself 
arises only when the material conditions necessary for its solution 
already exists or are at least in the process of formation.² (Karl Marx, 
Selected Works, Vol. I, pp. 356-57.) 
Such is Marxist materialism as applied to social life, to the history 
of society. 
Such are the principal features of dialectical and historical materialism. 
It will be seen from this what a theoretical treasure was safeguarded 
by Lenin for the Party and protected from the attacks of the revisionists 
and renegades, and how important was the appearance of Lenin¹s book, 
Materialism and Empirio-Criticism, for the development of our Party.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 132 
3. BOLSHEVIKS AND MENSHEVIKS IN THE PERIOD OF THE 
STOLYPIN REACTION. STRUGGLE OF THE BOLSHEVIKS AGAINST 
THE LIQUIDATORS AND OTZOVISTS 
During the years of reaction, the work in the Party organizations 
was far more difficult than during the preceding period of development 
of the revolution. The Party membership had sharply declined. Many 
of the petty-bourgeois fellow-travelers of the Party, especially the intellectuals, 
deserted its ranks from fear of persecution by the tsarist government. 
Lenin pointed out that at such moments revolutionary parties should 
perfect their knowledge. During the period of rise of the revolution they 
learned how to advance; during the period of reaction they should learn 
how to retreat properly, how to go underground, how to preserve and 
strengthen the illegal party, how to make use of legal opportunities, of 
all legally existing, especially mass, organizations in order to strengthen 
their connections with the masses. 
The Mensheviks retreated in panic, not believing that a new rise in 
the tide of revolution was possible; they disgracefully renounced the 
revolutionary demands of the program and the revolutionary slogans of 
the Party; they wanted to liquidate, to abolish, the revolutionary illegal 
party of the proletariat. For this reason, Mensheviks of this type came 
to be known as Liquidators. 
Unlike the Mensheviks, the Bolsheviks were certain that within the 
next few years there would be a rise in the tide of revolution, and held 
that it was the duty of the Party to prepare the masses for this new rise. 
The fundamental problems of the revolution had not been solved. The 
peasants had not obtained the landlords¹ land, the workers had not obtained 
the 8-hour day, the tsarist autocracy, so detested by the people, 
had not been overthrown, and it had again suppressed the meagre political 
liberties which the people had wrung from it in 1905. Thus the 
causes which had given rise to the Revolution of 1905 still remained in 
force. That is why the Bolsheviks were certain that there would be a 
new rise of the revolutionary movement, prepared for it and mustered the 
forces of the working class. 
The Bolsheviks derived their certainty that a new rise in the tide 
of the revolution was inevitable also from the fact that the Revolution of 
1905 had taught the working class to fight for its rights in mass revolutionary 
struggle. During the period of reaction, when the capitalists took 
the offensive, the workers could not forget these lessons of 1905. Lenin 
quoted letters from workers in which they told how factory owners were

133 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
again oppressing and humiliating them, and in which they said: ³Wait, 
another I 905 will come!² 
The fundamental political aim of the Bolsheviks remained what it 
had been in 1905, namely, to overthrow tsardom, to carry the bourgeoisdemocratic 
revolution to its conclusion and to proceed to the Socialist 
revolution. Never for a moment did the Bolsheviks forget this aim, and 
they continued to put before the masses the principal revolutionary slogans 
a democratic republic, the confiscation of the landed estates, and an 
8-hour day. 
But the tactics of the Party could not remain what they had been 
during the rising tide of the revolution in 1905. For example, it would 
have been wrong in the immediate future to call the masses to a general 
political strike or to an armed uprising, for the revolutionary movement 
was on the decline, the working class was in a state of extreme 
fatigue, and the position of the reactionary classes had been strengthened 
considerably. The Party had to reckon with the new situation. Offensive 
tactics had to be replaced by defensive tactics, the tactics of mustering 
forces, the tactics of withdrawing the cadres underground and of carrying 
on the work of the Party from underground, the tactics of combining 
illegal work with work in the legal working-class organizations. 
And the Bolsheviks proved able to accomplish this. 
³We knew how to work during the long years preceding the 
revolution. Not for nothing do they say that we are as firm as a rock. 
The Social-Democrats have formed a proletarian party which will not 
lose heart at the failure of the first armed onslaught, will not lose 
its head, and will not be carried away by adventures,² wrote Lenin. 
(Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XII, p. 126.) 
The Bolsheviks strove to preserve and strengthen the illegal Party 
organizations. But at the same time they deemed it essential to utilize 
every legal opportunity, every legal opening to maintain and preserve 
connections with the masses and thus strengthen the Party. 
³This was a period when our Party turned from the open revolutionary 
struggle against tsardom to roundabout methods of struggle, 
to the utilization of each and every legal opportunityfrom 
mutual aid societies to the Duma platform. This was a period of 
retreat after we had been defeated in the Revolution of 1905. This 
turn made it incumbent upon us to master new methods of struggle, 
in order to muster our forces and resume the open revolutionary 
struggle against tsardom.² (J. Stalin, Verbatim Report of the Fifteenth 
Party Congress, Russ. ed., pp. 366-67, 1935.)

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 134 
The surviving legal organizations served as a sort of screen for the 
underground organizations of the Party and as a means of maintaining 
connections with the masses. In order to preserve their connections with 
the masses, the Bolsheviks made use of the trade unions and other legally 
existing public organizations, such as sick benefit societies, workers¹ cooperative 
societies, clubs, educational societies and People¹s Houses. The 
Bolsheviks made use of the platform of the State Duma to expose the 
policy of the tsarist government, to expose the Constitutional-Democrats, 
and to win the support of the peasants for the proletariat. The preservation 
of the illegal Party organization, and the direction of all other forms of 
political work through this organization, enabled the Party to pursue a 
correct line and to muster forces in preparation for a new rise in the 
tide of revolution. 
The Bolsheviks carried out their revolutionary line in a fight on 
two fronts, a fight against the two varieties of opportunism within the 
Partyagainst the Liquidators, who were open adversaries of the Party, 
and against what were known as the Otzovists, who were concealed foes 
of the Party. 
The Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin, waged a relentless struggle against 
liquidationism from the very inception of this opportunist trend. Lenin 
pointed out that the Liquidators were agents of the liberal bourgeoisie 
within the Party. 
In December 1908, the Fifth (All-Russian) Conference of the 
R.S.D.L.P. was held in Paris. On Lenin¹s motion, this conference condemned 
liquidationism, that is, the attempts of a certain section of the Party 
intellectuals (Mensheviks) ³to liquidate the existing organization of the 
R.S.D.L.P. and to replace it at all costs, even at the price of down-right 
renunciation of the program, tactics and traditions of the Party, by an 
amorphous association functioning legally.² (C.P.S.U.[B.] in Resolutions, 
Russ. ed., Part I, p. 128.) 
The conference called upon all Party organizations to wage a resolute 
struggle against the attempts of the Liquidators. 
But the Mensheviks did not abide by this decision of the conference 
and increasingly committed themselves to liquidationism, betrayal of the 
revolution, and collaboration with the Constitutional-Democrats. The 
Mensheviks were more and more openly renouncing the revolutionary 
program of the proletarian Party, the demands for a democratic republic, 
for an 8-hour day and for the confiscation of the landed estates. They 
wanted, at the price of renouncing the program and tactics of the Party, 
to obtain the consent of the tsarist government to the existence of an 
open, legal, supposedly ³labour² party. They were prepared to make

135 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
peace with and to adapt themselves to the Stolypin regime. That is why 
the Liquidators were also called the ³Stolypin Labour Party.² 
Besides fighting the overt adversaries of the revolution, the Liquidators, 
who were headed by Dan, Axelrod, and Potressov, and assisted by 
Martov, Trotsky and other Mensheviks, the Bolsheviks also waged a 
relentless struggle against the covert Liquidators, the Otzovists, who 
camouflaged their opportunism by ³Left² phraseology. Otzovists was 
the name given to certain former Bolsheviks who demanded the recall 
(otzyv means recall) of the workers¹ deputies from the State Duma 
and the discontinuation of work in legally existing organizations altogether. 
In 1908 a number of Bolsheviks demanded the recall of the Social- 
Democratic deputies from the State Duma. Hence, they were called 
Otzovists. The Otzovists formed their own group (Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, 
Alexinsky, Pokrovsky, Bubnov and others) which started a struggle 
against Lenin and Lenin¹s line. The Otzovists stubbornly refused 
to work in the trade unions and other legally existing societies. In doing so 
they did great injury to the workers¹ cause. The Otzovists were driving 
a wedge between the Party and the working class, tending to deprive 
the Party of its connections with the non-party masses; they wanted 
to seclude themselves within the underground organization, yet at the 
same time they placed it in jeopardy by denying it the opportunity of 
utilizing legal cover. The Otzovists did not understand that in the 
State Duma, and through the State Duma, the Bolsheviks could influence 
the peasantry, could expose the policy of the tsarist government 
and the policy of the Constitutional-Democrats, who were trying to 
gain the following of the peasantry by fraud. The Otzovists hampered 
the mustering of forces for a new advance of the revolution. The 
Otzovists were therefore ³Liquidators inside-out²: they endeavoured to 
destroy the possibility of utilizing the legally existing organizations and, 
in fact, renounced proletarian leadership of the broad non-party masses, 
renounced revolutionary work. 
A conference of the enlarged editorial board of the Bolshevik newspaper 
Proletary, summoned in 1909 to discuss the conduct of the Otzovists, 
condemned them. The Bolsheviks announced that they had nothing 
in common with the Otzovists and expelled them from the Bolshevik 
organization. 
Both the Liquidators and the Otzovists were nothing but pettybourgeois 
fellow-travelers of the proletariat and its Party. When times 
were hard for the proletariat the true character of the Liquidators and 
Otzovists became revealed with particular clarity.

4. STRUGGLE OF THE BOLSHEVIKS AGAINST TROTSKYISM. ANTIPARTY 
AUGUST BLOC 
At a time when the Bolsheviks were waging a relentless struggle on 
two frontsagainst the Liquidators and against the Otzovistsdefending 
the consistent line of the proletarian party, Trotsky supported the 
Menshevik Liquidators. It was at this period that Lenin branded him 
³Judas Trotsky.² Trotsky formed a group of writers in Vienna (Austria) 
and began to publish an allegedly non-factional, but in reality Menshevik 
newspaper. ³Trotsky behaves like a most despicable careerist and factionalist. 
. . . He pays lip service to the Party, but behaves worse than any 
other factionalist,² wrote Lenin at the time. 
Later, in 1912, Trotsky organized the August Bloc, a bloc of all 
the anti-Bolshevik groups and trends directed against Lenin and the 
Bolshevik Party. The Liquidators and the Otzovists united in this anti- 
Bolshevik bloc, thus demonstrating their kinship. Trotsky and the Trotskyites 
took up a liquidationist stand on all fundamental issues. But Trotsky 
masked his liquidationism under the guise of Centrism, that is, conciliationism; 
he claimed that he belonged to neither the Bolsheviks nor the Mensheviks 
and that he was trying to reconcile them. In this connection, 
Lenin said that Trotsky was more vile and pernicious than the open 
Liquidators, because he was trying to deceive the workers into believing 
that he was ³above factions,² whereas in fact he entirely supported the 
Menshevik Liquidators. The Trotskyites were the principal group that 
fostered Centrism. 
³Centrism,² writes Comrade Stalin, ³is a political concept. Its 
ideology is one of adaptation, of subordination of the interests of the 
proletariat to the interests of the petty-bourgeoisie within one common 
party. This ideology is alien and abhorrent to Leninism.² (Stalin, 
Leninism, Vol. II, ³The Industrialization of the Country and the 
Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U.,² p. 97.) 
At this period Kamenev, Zinoviev and Rykov were actually covert 
agents of Trotsky, for they often helped him against Lenin. With the 
aid of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov and other covert allies of Trotsky, a 
Plenum of the Central Committee was convened in January 1910 against 
Lenin¹s wishes. By that time the composition of the Central Committee 
had changed owing to the arrest of a number of Bolsheviks, and the 
vacillating elements were able to force through anti-Leninist decisions. 
Thus, it was decided at this plenum to close down the Bolshevik newspaper 
Proletary and to give financial support to Trotsky¹s newspaper

137 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
Pravda, published in Vienna. Kamenev joined the editorial board of 
Trotsky¹s newspaper and together with Zinoviev strove to make it the 
organ of the Central Committee. 
It was only on Lenin¹s insistence that the January Plenum of the 
Central Committee adopted a resolution condemning liquidationism and 
otzovism, but here too Zinoviev and Kamenev insisted on Trotsky¹s proposal 
that the Liquidators should not be referred to as such. 
It turned out as Lenin had foreseen and forewarned: only the Bolsheviks 
obeyed the decision of the plenum of the Central Committee and 
closed down their organ, Proletary, whereas the Mensheviks continued 
to publish their financial liquidationist newspaper Golos Sotsial-Demokrat 
(Voice of the Social-Democrat). 
Lenin¹s position was fully supported by Comrade Stalin who published 
a special article in Sotsial-Demokrat, No. 11, in which he condemned 
the conduct of the accomplices of Trotskyism, and spoke of the 
necessity of putting an end to the abnormal situation created within the 
Bolshevik group by the treacherous conduct of Kamenev, Zinoviev and 
Rykov. The article advanced as immediate tasks what was later carried 
into effect at the Prague Party Conference, namely, convocation of a 
general Party conference, publication of a Party newspaper appearing 
legally, and creation of an illegal practical Party centre in Russia. Comrade 
Stalin¹s article was based on decisions of the Baku Committee, which 
fully supported Lenin. 
To counteract Trotsky¹s anti-Party August Bloc, which consisted 
exclusively of anti-Party elements, from the Liquidators and Trotskyites 
to the Otzovists and ³god-builders,² a Party bloc was formed consisting 
of people who wanted to preserve and strengthen the illegal proletarian 
Party. This bloc consisted of the Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin, and a 
small number of pro-Party Mensheviks, headed by Plekhanov. Plekhanov 
and his group of pro-Party Mensheviks, while maintaining the Menshevik 
position on a number of questions, emphatically dissociated themselves 
from the August Bloc and the Liquidators and sought to reach agreement 
with the Bolsheviks. Lenin accepted Plekhanov¹s proposal and consented 
to a temporary bloc with him against the anti-Party elements on the ground 
that such a bloc would be advantageous to the Party and fatal to the 
Liquidators. 
Comrade Stalin fully supported this bloc. He was in exile at the time 
and from there wrote a letter to Lenin, saying: 
³In my opinion the line of the bloc (Lenin-Plekhanov) is the 
only correct one: 1) this line, and it alone, answers to the real inter

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 138 
ests of the work in Russia, which demands that all Party elements 
should rally together; 2) this line, and it alone, will expedite the process 
of emancipation of the legal organizations from the yoke of the Liquidators, 
by digging a gulf between the Mek* workers and the Liquidators, 
and dispersing and disposing of the latter.² (Lenin and Stalin, 
Russ. ed., Vol. I, pp. 529-30.) 
Thanks to a skilful combination of illegal and legal work, the Bolsheviks 
were able to become a serious force in the legal workers¹ organizations. 
This was revealed, incidentally, in the great influence which the 
Bolsheviks exercised on the workers¹ groups at four legally held congresses 
that took place at that perioda congress of people¹s universities, 
a women¹s congress, a congress of factory physicians, and a temperance 
congress. The speeches of the Bolsheviks at these congresses were of 
great political value and awakened a response all over the country. For 
example, at the congress of people¹s universities, the Bolshevik workers¹ 
delegation exposed the policy of tsardom which stifled all cultural activity, 
and contended that no real cultural progress in the country was conceivable 
unless tsardom were abolished. The workers¹ delegation at the 
congress of factory physicians told of the frightfully unsanitary conditions 
in which the workers had to live and work, and drew the conclusion 
that factory hygiene could not be properly ensured until tsardom was 
overthrown. 
The Bolsheviks gradually squeezed the Liquidators out of the various 
legal organizations that still survived. The peculiar tactics of a united 
front with the Plekhanov pro-Party group enabled the Bolsheviks to win 
over a number of Menshevik worker organizations (in the Vyborg district, 
Ekaterinoslav, etc.). 
In this difficult period the Bolsheviks set an example of how legal work 
should be combined with illegal work. 
5. PRAGUE PARTY CONFERENCE, I9I2. BOLSHEVIKS CONSTITUTE 
THEMSELVES AN INDEPENDENT MARXIST PARTY 
The fight against the Liquidators and Otzovists, as well as against 
the Trotskyites, confronted the Bolsheviks with the urgent necessity of 
uniting all the Bolsheviks and forming them into an independent Bolshevik 
Party. This was absolutely essential not only in order to put an end 
to the opportunist trends within the Party which were splitting the work- 
* Mek, an abbreviation for Menshevik.Ed.

139 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
ing class, but also in order to complete the work of mustering the forces 
of the working class and preparing it for a new upward swing of the 
revolution. 
But before this task could be accomplished the Party had to be rid 
of opportunists, of Mensheviks. 
No Bolshevik now doubted that it was unthinkable for the Bolsheviks 
to remain in one party with the Mensheviks. The treacherous 
conduct of the Mensheviks in the period of the Stolypin reaction, their 
attempts to liquidate the proletarian party and to organize a new, reformist 
party, made a rupture with them inevitable. By remaining in 
one party with the Mensheviks, the Bolsheviks in one way or another 
accepted moral responsibility for the behaviour of the Mensheviks. But 
for the Bolsheviks to accept moral responsibility for the open treachery 
of the Mensheviks was unthinkable, unless they themselves wanted to 
become traitors to the Party and the working class. Unity with the 
Mensheviks within a single party was thus assuming the character of a 
betrayal of the working class and its party. Consequently, the actual 
rupture with the Mensheviks had to be carried to its conclusion: a formal 
organizational rupture and the expulsion of the Mensheviks from the 
Party. 
Only in this way was it possible to restore the revolutionary party 
of the proletariat with a single program, single tactics, and a single class 
organization. 
Only in this way was it possible to restore the real (not just formal) 
unity of the Party, which the Mensheviks had destroyed. 
This task was to be performed by the Sixth General Party Conference, 
for which the Bolsheviks were making preparations. 
But this was only one aspect of the matter. A formal rupture with 
the Mensheviks and the formation by the Bolsheviks of a separate party 
was, of course, a very important political task. But the Bolsheviks were 
confronted with another and even more important task. The task of 
the Bolsheviks was not merely to break with the Mensheviks and formally 
constitute themselves a separate party, but above all, having broken with 
the Mensheviks, to create a new party, to create a party of a new type, 
different from the usual Social-Democratic parties of the West, one that 
was free of opportunist elements and capable of leading the proletariat 
in a struggle for power. 
In fighting the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks of all shades, from Axelrod 
and Martynov to Martov and Trotsky, invariably used weapons borrowed 
from the arsenal of the West-European Social-Democrats. They 
wanted in Russia a party similar, let us say, to the German or French

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 140 
Social-Democratic Party. They fought the Bolsheviks just because they 
sensed something new in them, something unusual and different from the 
Social-Democrats of the West. And what did the Social-Democratic 
parties of the West represent at that time? A mixture, a hodge-podge 
of Marxist and opportunist elements, of friends and foes of the revolution, 
of supporters and opponents of the Party principle, the former 
gradually becoming ideologically reconciled to the latter, and virtually 
subordinated to them. Conciliation with the opportunists, with the traitors 
to the revolution, for the sake of what?the Bolsheviks asked the West- 
European Social-Democrats. For the sake of ³peace within the Party,² 
for the sake of ³unity²the latter replied. Unity with whom, with the 
opportunists? Yes, they replied, with the opportunists. It was clear that 
such parties could not be revolutionary parties. 
The Bolsheviks could not help seeing that after Engels¹ death the 
West-European Social-Democratic parties had begun to degenerate from 
parties of social revolution into parties of ³social reforms,² and that each 
of these parties, as an organization, had already been converted from a 
leading force into an appendage of its own parliamentary group. 
The Bolsheviks could not help knowing that such a party boded no 
good to the proletariat, that such a party was not capable of leading the 
working class to revolution. 
The Bolsheviks could not help knowing that the proletariat needed, 
not such a party, but a different kind of party, a new and genuinely 
Marxist party, which would be irreconcilable towards the opportunists 
and revolutionary towards the bourgeoisie, which would be firmly knit 
and monolithic, which would be a party of social revolution, a party 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
It was this new kind of party that the Bolsheviks wanted. And the 
Bolsheviks worked to build up such a party. The whole history of the 
struggle against the ³Economists,² Mensheviks, Trotskyites, Otzovists 
and idealists of all shades, down to the empirio-criticists, was a history 
of the building up of just such a party. The Bolsheviks wanted to create 
a new party, a Bolshevist party, which would serve as a model for all 
who wanted to have a real revolutionary Marxist party. The Bolsheviks 
had been working to build up such a party ever since the time of the old 
Iskra. They worked for it stubbornly, persistently, in spite of everything. 
A fundamental and decisive part was played in this work by the writings 
of LeninWhat Is To Be Done?, Two Tactics, etc. Lenin¹s What 
Is To Be Done? was the ideological preparation for such a party. Lenin¹s 
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back was the organizational preparation 
for such a party. Lenin¹s Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Demo

141 1 9 0 8 - 1 9 1 2 
cratic Revolution was the political preparation for such a party. And, 
lastly, Lenin¹s Materialism and Empirio-Criticism was the theoretical 
preparation for such a party. 
It may be safely said that never in history has any political group 
been so thoroughly prepared to constitute itself a party as the Bolshevik 
group was. 
The conditions were therefore fully ripe and ready for the Bolsheviks 
to constitute themselves a party. 
It was the task of the Sixth Party Conference to crown the completed 
work by expelling the Mensheviks and formally constituting the new 
party, the Bolshevik Party. 
The Sixth All-Russian Party Conference was held in Prague in 
January 1912. Over twenty Party organizations were represented. The 
conference, therefore, had the significance of a regular Party congress. 
In the statement of the conference which announced that the shattered 
central apparatus of the Party had been restored and a Central 
Committee set up, it was declared that the period of reaction had been 
the most difficult the Russian Social-Democratic Party had experienced 
since it had taken shape as a definite organization. In spite of all persecution, 
in spite of the severe blows dealt it from without and the treachery 
and vacillation of the opportunists within, the party of the proletariat had 
preserved intact its banner and its organization. 
³Not only have the banner of the Russian Social-Democratic Party, 
its program and its revolutionary traditions survived, but so has its organization, 
which persecution may have undermined and weakened, but could 
never utterly destroy²the statement of the conference declared. 
The conference recorded the first symptoms of a new rise of the 
working-class movement in Russia and a revival in Party work. 
In its resolution on the reports presented by the local organizations, 
the conference noted that ³energetic work is being conducted everywhere 
among the Social-Democratic workers with the object of strengthening 
the local illegal Social-Democratic organizations and groups.² 
The conference noted that the most important rule of Bolshevik tactics 
in periods of retreat, namely, to combine illegal work with legal work 
within the various legally existing workers¹ societies and unions, was being 
observed in all the localities. 
The Prague Conference elected a Bolshevik Central Committee of 
the Party, consisting of Lenin, Stalin, Ordjonikidze, Sverdlov, Spandaryan, 
Goloshchekin and others. Comrades Stalin and Sverdlov were 
elected to the Central Committee in their absence, as they were in exile

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 142 
at the time. Among the elected alternate members of the Central Committee 
was Comrade Kalinin. 
For the direction of revolutionary work in Russia a practical centre 
(the Russian Bureau of the C.C.) was set up with Comrade Stalin at 
its head and including Comrades Y. Sverdlov, S. Spandaryan, S. Ordjonikidze, 
M. Kalinin and Goloshchekin. 
The Prague Conference reviewed the whole preceding struggle of 
the Bolsheviks against opportunism and decided to expel the Mensheviks 
from the Party. 
By expelling the Mensheviks from the Party, the Prague Conference 
formally inaugurated the independent existence of the Bolshevik Party. 
Having routed the Mensheviks ideologically and organizationally and 
expelled them from the Party, the Bolsheviks preserved the old banner 
of the Partyof the R.S.D.L.P. That is why the Bolshevik Party continued 
until 1918 to call itself the Russian Social-Democratic Labour 
Party, adding the word ³Bolsheviks² in brackets. 
Writing to Gorky at the beginning of 1912, on the results of the 
Prague Conference, Lenin said: 
³At last we have succeeded, in spite of the Liquidator scum, in 
restoring the Party and its Central Committee. I hope you will rejoice 
with us over the fact.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. 
XXIX, p. 19.) 
Speaking of the significance of the Prague Conference, Comrade 
Stalin said: 
³This conference was of the utmost importance in the history 
of our Party, for it drew a boundary line between the Bolsheviks 
and the Mensheviks and amalgamated the Bolshevik organizations 
all over the country into a united Bolshevik Party.² (Verbatim Report 
of the Fifteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.[B.], Russ. ed., pp. 
361-362.) 
After the expulsion of the Mensheviks and the constitution by the 
Bolsheviks of an independent party, the Bolshevik Party became firmer 
and stronger. The Party strengthens itself by purging its ranks of opportunist 
elementsthat is one of the maxims of the Bolshevik Party, 
which is a party of a new type fundamentally different from the Social- 
Democratic parties of the Second International. Although the parties 
of the Second International called themselves Marxist parties, in reality 
they tolerated foes of Marxism, avowed opportunists, in their ranks and 
allowed them to corrupt and to ruin the Second International. The Bol

sheviks, on the contrary, waged a relentless struggle against the opportunists, 
purged the proletarian party of the filth of opportunism and 
succeeded in creating a party of a new type, a Leninist Party, the Party 
which later achieved the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
If the opportunists had remained within the ranks of the proletarian 
party, the Bolshevik Party could not have come out on the broad highway 
and led the proletariat, it could not have taken power and set up the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, it could not have emerged victorious from 
the Civil War and built Socialism. 
The Prague Conference decided to put forward as the chief immediate 
political slogans of the Party the demands contained in the minimum 
program: a democratic republic, an 8-hour day, and the confiscation of the 
landed estates. 
It was under these revolutionary slogans that the Bolsheviks conducted 
their campaign in connection with the elections to the Fourth State 
Duma. 
It was these slogans that guided the new rise of the revolutionary 
movement of the working-class masses in the years I9I2-I4. 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
The years I908-I2 were a most difficult period for revolutionary 
work. After the defeat of the revolution, when the revolutionary movement 
was on the decline and the masses were fatigued, the Bolsheviks 
changed their tactics and passed from the direct struggle against tsardom 
to a roundabout struggle. In the difficult conditions that prevailed during 
the Stolypin reaction, the Bolsheviks made use of the slightest legal 
opportunity to maintain their connections with the masses (from sick 
benefit societies and trade unions to the Duma platform). The Bolsheviks 
indefatigably worked to muster forces for a new rise of the revolutionary 
movement. 
In the difficult conditions brought about by the defeat of the revolution, 
the disintegration of the oppositional trends, the disappointment with 
the revolution, and the increasing endeavours of intellectuals who had 
deserted the Party (Bogdanov, Bazarov and others) to revise its theoretical 
foundations, the Bolsheviks were the only force in the Party 
who did not furl the Party banner, who remained faithful to the Party 
program, and who beat off the attacks of the ³critics² of Marxist theory 
(Lenin¹s Materialism and Empirio-Criticism). What helped the leading 
core of the Bolsheviks, centred around Lenin, to safeguard the Party

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 144 
and its revolutionary principles was that this core had been tempered 
by Marxist-Leninist ideology and had grasped the perspectives of the 
revolution. ³Not for nothing do they say that we are as firm as a rock,² 
Lenin stated in referring to the Bolsheviks. 
The Mensheviks at that period were drawing farther and farther 
away from the revolution. They became Liquidators, demanding the 
liquidation, abolition, of the illegal revolutionary party of the proletariat; 
they more and more openly renounced the Party program and the revolutionary 
aims and slogans of the Party, and endeavoured to organize 
their own, reformist party, which the workers christened a ³Stolypin 
Labour Party.² Trotsky supported the Liquidators, pharisaically using 
the slogan ³unity of the Party² as a screen, but actually meaning unity 
with the Liquidators. 
On the other hand, some of the Bolsheviks, who did not understand 
the necessity for the adoption of new and roundabout ways of combating 
tsardom, demanded that legal opportunities should not be utilized and that 
the workers¹ deputies in the State Duma be recalled. These Otzovists 
were driving the Party towards a rupture with the masses and were 
hampering the mustering of forces for a new rise of the revolution. 
Using ³Left² phraseology as a screen, the Otzovists, like the Liquidators, 
in essence renounced the revolutionary struggle. 
The Liquidators and Otzovists united against Lenin in a common 
bloc, known as the August Bloc, organized by Trotsky. 
In the struggle against the Liquidators and Otzovists, in the struggle 
against the August Bloc, the Bolsheviks gained the upper hand and succeeded 
in safeguarding the illegal proletarian party. 
The outstanding event of this period was the Prague Conference 
of the R.S.D.L.P. (January 1912). At this conference the Mensheviks 
were expelled from the Party, and the formal unity of the Bolsheviks 
with the Mensheviks within one party was ended forever. From a political 
group, the Bolsheviks formally constituted themselves an independent 
party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). The 
Prague Conference inaugurated a party of a new type, the party of 
Leninism, the Bolshevik Party. 
The purge of the ranks of the proletarian party of opportunists, Mensheviks, 
effected at the Prague Conference, had an important and decisive 
influence on the subsequent development of the Party and the revolution. 
If the Bolsheviks had not expelled the betrayers of the workers¹ cause, 
the Menshevik compromisers, from the Party, the proletarian party 
would have been unable in 1917 to rouse the masses for the fight for 
the dictatorship of the proletariat.

THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY DURING THE NEW 
RISE OF THE WORKING-CLASS MOVEMENT 
BEFORE THE FIRST IMPERIALIST WAR 
( 1 9 1 2 - 1 9 1 4 ) 
1. RISE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN THE PERIOD 
1912-14 
The triumph of the Stolypin reaction was shortlived. A government 
which would offer the people nothing but the knout and the gallows 
could not endure. Repressive measures became so habitual that they 
ceased to inspire fear in the people. The fatigue felt by the workers in 
the years immediately following the defeat of the revolution began to 
wear off. The workers resumed the struggle. The Bolsheviks¹ forecast 
that a new rise in the tide of revolution was inevitable proved correct. 
In 1911 the number of strikers already exceeded 100,000, whereas in 
each of the previous years it had been no more than 50,000 or 60,000. 
The Prague Party Conference, held in January 1912, could already 
register the beginnings of a revival of the working-class movement. But 
the real rise in the revolutionary movement began in April and May 
1912, when mass political strikes broke out in connection with the shooting 
down of workers in the Lena goldfields. 
On April 4, 1912, during a strike in the Lena goldfields in Siberia, 
over 500 workers were killed or wounded upon the orders of a tsarist 
officer of the gendarmerie. The shooting down of an unarmed body 
of Lena miners who were peacefully proceeding to negotiate with the 
management stirred the whole country. This new bloody deed of the 
tsarist autocracy was committed to break an economic strike of the miners 
and thus please the masters of the Lena goldfields, the British capitalists. 
The British capitalists and their Russian partners derived huge 
profits from the Lena goldfieldsover 7,000,000 rubles annuallyby 
most shamelessly exploiting the workers. They paid the workers miserable 
wages and supplied them with rotten food unfit to eat. Unable to 
endure the oppression and humiliation any longer, six thousand workers 
of the Lena goldfields went on strike. 
The proletariat of St. Petersburg, Moscow and all other industrial 
145

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 146 
centres and regions replied to the Lena shooting by mass strikes, demonstrations 
and meetings. 
³We were so dazed and shocked that we could not at once find 
words to express our feelings. Whatever protest we made would be 
but a pale reflection of the anger that seethed in the hearts of all of us. 
Nothing can help us, neither tears nor protests, but an organized mass 
struggle²the workers of one group of factories declared in their resolution. 
The furious indignation of the workers was further aggravated when 
the tsarist Minister Makarov, who was interpellated by the Social-Democratic 
group in the State Duma on the subject of the Lena massacre, 
insolently declared: ³So it was, so it will be!² The number of participants 
in the political protest strikes against the bloody massacre of the 
Lena workers rose to 300,000. 
The Lena events were like a hurricane which rent the atmosphere 
of ³peace² created by the Stolypin regime. 
This is what Comrade Stalin wrote in this connection in 1912 i n 
the St. Petersburg Bolshevik newspaper, Zvezda (Star): 
³The Lena shooting has broken the ice of silence and the river 
of the people¹s movement has begun to flow. The ice is broken! . . . 
All that was evil and pernicious in the present regime, all the ills of 
much-suffering Russia were focussed in the one fact, the Lena 
events. That is why it was the Lena shooting that served as a signal 
for the strikes and demonstrations.² 
The efforts of the Liquidators and Trotskyites to bury the revolution 
had been in vain. The Lena events showed that the forces of revolution 
were alive, that a tremendous store of revolutionary energy had 
accumulated in the working class. The May Day strikes of 1912 i nvolved 
about 400,000 workers. These strikes bore a marked political 
character and were held under the Bolshevik revolutionary slogans of a 
democratic republic, an 8-hour day, and the confiscation of the landed 
estates. These main slogans were designed to unite not only the broad 
masses of the workers, but also the peasants and soldiers for a revolutionary 
onslaught on the autocracy. 
³The huge May Day strike of the proletariat of all Russia and 
the accompanying street demonstrations, revolutionary proclamations, 
and revolutionary speeches to gatherings of workers have clearly 
shown that Russia has entered the phase of a rise in the revolution² 
wrote Lenin in an article entitled ³The Revolutionary Rise.² 
(Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XV, p. 533.)

147 1 9 1 2 - 1 9 1 4 
Alarmed by the revolutionary spirit of the workers, the Liquidators 
came out against the strike movement; they called it a ³strike fever.² 
The Liquidators and their ally, Trotsky, wanted to substitute for the 
revolutionary struggle of the proletariat a ³petition campaign.² They 
invited the workers to sign a petition, a scrap of paper, requesting the 
granting of ³rights² (abolition of the restrictions on the right of association, 
the right to strike, etc.), which was then to be sent to the State 
Duma. The Liquidators managed to collect only 1,300 signatures at a 
time when hundreds of thousands of workers backed the revolutionary 
slogans of the Bolsheviks. 
The working class followed the path indicated by the Bolsheviks. 
The economic situation in the country at that period was as follows: 
In 1910 industrial stagnation had already been succeeded by a revival, 
an extension of production in the main branches of industry. 
Whereas the output of pig iron had amounted to 186,000,000 poods 
in 1910, and to 256,000,000 poods in 1912, in 1913 it amounted to 
283,000,000 poods. The output of coal rose from 1,522,000,000 poods 
in 1910 to 2,214,000,000 poods in 1913. 
The expansion of capitalist industry was accompanied by a rapid 
growth of the proletariat. A distinguishing feature of the development 
of industry was the further concentration of production in large plants. 
Whereas in 1901 the number of workers engaged in large plants employing 
500 workers and over amounted to 46.7 per cent of the total number 
of workers, the corresponding figure in 1910 was already about 54 
per cent, or over half the total number of workers. Such a degree of 
concentration of industry was unprecedented. Even in a country so 
industrially developed as the United States only about one-third the total 
number of workers were employed in large plants at that period. 
The growth of the proletariat and its concentration in large enterprises, 
combined with the existence of such a revolutionary party as the 
Bolshevik Party, were converting the working class of Russia into the 
greatest force in the political life of the country. The barbarous methods 
of exploitation of the workers practised in the factories, combined with 
the intolerable police regime of the tsarist underlings, lent every big 
strike a political character. Furthermore, the intertwining of the economic 
and political struggles imparted exceptional revolutionary force to 
the mass strikes. 
In the van of the revolutionary working-class movement marched 
the heroic proletariat of St. Petersburg; St. Petersburg was followed by 
the Baltic Provinces, Moscow and the Moscow Province, the Volga region 
and the south of Russia. In 1913 the movement spread to the Western

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 148 
Territory, Poland and the Caucasus. In all, 725,000 workers, according 
to official figures, and over one million workers according to fuller 
statistics, took part in strikes in 1912, and 861,000 according to official 
figures, and 1,272,000 according to fuller statistics, took part in strikes 
in 1913. In the first half of 1914 the number of strikers already 
amounted to about one and a half million. 
Thus the revolutionary rise of 1912-14, the sweep of the strike 
movement, created a situation in the country similar to that which had 
existed at the beginning of the Revolution of 1905. 
The revolutionary mass strikes of the proletariat were of moment to 
the whole people. They were directed against the autocracy, and they 
met with the sympathy of the vast majority of the labouring population. 
The manufacturers retaliated by locking out the workers. In 1913, 
in the Moscow Province, the capitalists threw 50,000 textile workers 
on the streets. In March 1914, 70,000 workers were discharged in 
St. Petersburg in a single day. The workers of other factories and 
branches of industry assisted the strikers and their locked-out comrades 
by mass collections and sometimes by sympathy strikes. 
The rising working-class movement and the mass strikes also stirred 
up the peasants and drew them into the struggle. The peasants again 
began to rise against the landlords; they destroyed manors and kulak 
farmholds. In the years 1910-14 there were over 13,000 outbreaks of 
peasant disaffection. 
Revolutionary outbreaks also took place among the armed forces. In 
1912 there was an armed revolt of troops in Turkestan. Revolt was 
brewing in the Baltic Fleet and in Sevastopol. 
The revolutionary strike movement and demonstrations, led by the 
Bolshevik Party, showed that the working class was fighting not for 
partial demands, not for ³reforms,² but for the liberation of the people 
from tsardom. The country was heading for a new revolution. 
In the summer of 1912, Lenin removed from Paris to Galicia (formerly 
Austria) in order to be nearer to Russia. Here he presided over 
two conferences of members of the Central Committee and leading 
Party workers, one of which took place in Cracow at the end of 1912, 
and the other in Poronino, a small town near Cracow, in the autumn 
of 1913. These conferences adopted decisions on important questions 
of the working-class movement: the rise in the revolutionary movement, 
the tasks of the Party in connection with the strikes, the strengthening 
of the illegal organizations, the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, 
the Party press, the labour insurance campaign.

2. THE BOLSHEVIK NEWSPAPER ³PRAVDA.² THE BOLSHEVIK 
GROUP IN THE FOURTH STATE DUMA 
A powerful instrument used by the Bolshevik Party to strengthen 
its organizations and to spread its influence among the masses was the 
Bolshevik daily newspaper Pravda (Truth), published in St. Petersburg. 
It was founded, according to Lenin¹s instructions, on the initiative of 
Stalin, Olminsky and Poletayev. Pravda was a mass working-class paper 
founded simultaneously with the new rise of the revolutionary movement. 
Its first issue appeared on April 22 (May 5, New Style), 1912. 
This was a day of real celebration for the workers. In honour of 
Pravda¹s appearance it was decided henceforward to celebrate May 5 as 
workers¹ press day. 
Previous to the appearance of Pravda, the Bolsheviks already had a 
weekly newspaper called Zvezda, intended for advanced workers. Zvezda 
played an important part at the time of the Lena events. It printed a 
number of trenchant political articles by Lenin and Stalin which mobilized 
the working class for the struggle. But in view of the rising revolutionary 
tide, a weekly newspaper no longer met the requirements of the 
Bolshevik Party. A daily mass political newspaper designed for the 
broadest sections of the workers was needed. Pravda was such a newspaper. 
Pravda played an exceptionally important part at this period. It 
gained support for Bolshevism among broad masses of the working class. 
Because of incessant police persecution, fines, and confiscations of issues 
due to the publication of articles and letters not to the liking of the 
censor, Pravda could exist only with the active support of tens of thousands 
of advanced workers. Pravda was able to pay the huge fines only 
thanks to large collections made among the workers. Not infrequently, 
considerable portions of confiscated issues of Pravda nevertheless found 
their way into the hands of readers, because the more active workers 
would come to the printing shop at night and carry away bundles of the 
newspaper. 
The tsarist government suppressed Pravda eight times in the space 
of two and a half years; but each time, with the support of the workers, 
it reappeared under a new but similar name, e.g., Za Pravdu (For 
Truth), Put Pravdy (Path of Truth), Trudovaya Pravda (Labour 
Truth). 
While the average circulation of Pravda was 40,000 copies per day, 
the circulation of Luch (Ray), the Menshevik daily, did not exceed 
15,000 or 16,000.

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
The workers regarded Pravda as their own newspaper; they had 
great confidence in it and were very responsive to its calls. Every copy 
was read by scores of readers, passing from hand to hand; it moulded 
their class consciousness, educated them, organized them, and summoned 
them to the struggle. 
What did Pravda write about? 
Every issue contained dozens of letters from workers describing their 
life, the savage exploitation and the various forms of oppression and 
humiliation they suffered at the hands of the capitalists, their managers 
and foremen. These were trenchant and telling indictments of capitalist 
conditions. Pravda often reported cases of suicide of unemployed 
and starving workers who had lost hope of ever finding jobs again. 
Pravda wrote of the needs and demands of the workers of various 
factories and branches of industry, and told how the workers were fighting 
for their demands. Almost every issue contained reports of strikes 
at various factories. In big and protracted strikes, the newspaper helped 
to organize collections among the workers of other factories and branches 
of industry for the support of the strikers. Sometimes tens of thousands 
of rubles were collected for the strike funds, huge sums for those days 
when the majority of the workers received not more than 70 or 80 
kopeks per day. This fostered a spirit of proletarian solidarity among the 
workers and a consciousness of the unity of interests of all workers. 
The workers reacted to every political event, to every victory or 
defeat, by sending to Pravda letters, greetings, protests, etc. In its 
articles Pravda dealt with the tasks of the working-class movement from 
a consistent Bolshevik standpoint. A legally published newspaper could 
not call openly for the overthrow of tsardom. It had to resort to hints, 
which, however, the class-conscious workers understood very well, and 
which they explained to the masses. When, for example, Pravda wrote 
of the ³full and uncurtailed demands of the Year Five,² the workers 
understood that this meant the revolutionary slogans of the Bolsheviks, 
namely, the overthrow of tsardom, a democratic republic, the confiscation 
of the landed estates, and an 8-hour day. 
Pravda organized the advanced workers on the eve of the elections 
to the Fourth Duma. It exposed the treacherous position of those who 
advocated an agreement with the liberal bourgeoisie, the advocates of 
the ³Stolypin Labour Party²the Mensheviks. Pravda called upon the 
workers to vote for those who advocated the ³full and uncurtailed demands 
of the Year Five,² that is, the Bolsheviks. The elections were 
indirect, held in a series of stages: first, meetings of workers elected 
delegates; then these delegates chose electors; and it was these electors

151 1 9 1 2 - 1 9 1 4 
who participated in the elections of the workers¹ deputy to the Duma. 
On the day of the elections of the electors Pravda published a list of 
Bolshevik candidates and recommended the workers to vote for this 
list. The list could not be published earlier without exposing those on 
the list to the danger of arrest. 
Pravda helped to organize the mass actions of the proletariat. At 
the time of a big lockout in St. Petersburg in the spring of 1914, when 
it was inexpedient to declare a mass strike, Pravda called upon the workers 
to resort to other forms of struggle, such as mass meetings in the 
factories and demonstrations in the streets. This could not be stated 
openly in the newspaper. But the call was understood by class-conscious 
workers when they read an article by Lenin bearing the modest title 
³Forms of the Working-Class Movement² and stating that at the given 
moment strikes should yield place to a higher form of the working-class 
movementwhich meant a call to organize meetings and demonstrations. 
In this way the illegal revolutionary activities of the Bolsheviks were 
combined with legal forms of agitation and organization of the masses 
of the workers through Pravda. 
Pravda not only wrote of the life of the workers, their strikes and 
demonstrations, but also regularly described the life of the peasants, the 
famines from which they suffered, their exploitation by the feudal landlords. 
It described how as a result of the Stolypin ³reform² the kulak 
farmers robbed the peasants of the best parts of their land. Pravda drew the 
attention of the class-conscious workers to the widespread and burning 
discontent in the countryside. It taught the proletariat that the objectives 
of the Revolution of 1905 had not been attained, and that a new revolution 
was impending. It taught that in this second revolution the proletariat 
must act as the real leader and guide of the people, and that in 
this revolution it would have so powerful an ally as the revolutionary 
peasantry. 
The Mensheviks worked to get the proletariat to drop the idea of 
revolution, to stop thinking of the people, of the starvation of the peasants, 
of the domination of the Black-Hundred feudal landlords, and to 
fight only for ³freedom of association,² to present ³petitions² to this effect 
to the tsarist government. The Bolsheviks explained to the workers 
that this Menshevik gospel of renunciation of revolution, renunciation of 
an alliance with the peasantry, was being preached in the interests of 
the bourgeoisie, that the workers would most certainly defeat tsardom if 
they won over the peasantry as their ally, and that bad shepherds like 
the Mensheviks should be driven out as enemies of the revolution.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 152 
What did Pravda write about in its ³Peasant Life² section? 
Let us take, as an example, several letters relating to the year 1913. 
One letter from Samara, headed ³An Agrarian Case,² reports that 
of 45 peasants of the village of Novokhasbulat, Bugulma uyezd, accused 
of interfering with a surveyor who was marking out communal land 
to be allotted to peasants withdrawing from the commune, the majority 
were condemned to long terms of imprisonment. 
A brief letter from the Pskov Province states that the ³peasants of 
the village of Psitsa (near Zavalye Station) offered armed resistance to 
the rural police. Several persons were wounded. The clash was due to 
an agrarian dispute. Rural police have been dispatched to Psitsa, and the 
vice-governor and the procurator are on the way to the village.² 
A letter from the Ufa Province reported that peasant¹s allotments 
were being sold off in great numbers, and that famine and the law permitting 
withdrawal from the village communes were causing increasing 
numbers of peasants to lose their land. Take the hamlet of Borisovka. 
Here there are 27 peasant households owning 543 dessiatins of arable 
land between them. During the famine five peasants sold 31 dessiatins 
outright at prices varying from 25 to 33 rubles per dessiatin, though land 
is worth three or four times as much. In this village, too, seven peasants 
have mortgaged between them 177 dessiatins of arable land, receiving 
18 to 20 rubles per dessiatin for a term of six years at a rate of 12 per 
cent per annum. When the poverty of the population and the usurious 
rate of interest are borne in mind, it may be safely said that half of the 
177 dessiatins is bound to pass into the possession of the usurer, for it is not 
likely that even half the debtors can repay so large a sum in six years. 
In an article printed in Pravda and entitled ³Big Landlord and 
Small Peasant Land Ownership in Russia,² Lenin strikingly demonstrated 
to the workers and peasants what tremendous landed property 
was in the hands of the parasite landlords. Thirty thousand big landlords 
alone owned about 70,000,000 dessiatins of land between them. 
An equal area fell to the share of 10,000,000 peasant households. On an 
average, the big landlords owned 2,300 dessiatins each, while peasant 
households, including the kulaks, owned 7 dessiatins each; moreover, 
five million households of small peasants, that is, half the peasantry, 
owned no more than one or two dessiatins each. These figures clearly 
showed that the root of the poverty of the peasants and the recurrent 
famines lay in the large landed estates, in the survivals of serfdom, of 
which the peasants could rid themselves only by a revolution led by 
the working class. 
Through workers connected with the countryside, Pravda found its

153 1 9 1 2 - 1 9 1 4 
way into the villages and roused the politically advanced peasants to a 
revolutionary struggle. 
At the time Pravda was founded the illegal Social-Democratic organizations 
were entirely under the direction of the Bolsheviks. On the other 
hand, the legal forms of organization, such as the Duma group, the 
press, the sick benefit societies, the trade unions, had not yet been fully 
wrested from the Mensheviks. The Bolsheviks had to wage a determined 
struggle to drive the Liquidators out of the legally existing organizations 
of the working class. Thanks to Pravda, this fight ended in victory. 
Pravda stood in the centre of the struggle for the Party principle, 
for the building up of a mass working-class revolutionary party. Pravda 
rallied the legally existing organizations around the illegal centres of the 
Bolshevik Party and directed the working-class movement towards one 
definite aimpreparation for revolution. 
Pravda had a vast number of worker correspondents. In one year 
alone it printed over eleven thousand letters from workers. But it was 
not only by letters that Pravda maintained contact with the workingclass 
masses. Numbers of workers from the factories visited the editorial 
office every day. In the Pravda editorial office was concentrated a large 
share of the organizational work of the Party. Here meetings were 
arranged with representatives from Party nuclei; here reports were 
received of Party work in the mills and factories; and from here were 
transmitted the instructions of the St. Petersburg Committee and the 
Central Committee of the Party. 
As a result of two and a half years of persistent struggle against the 
Liquidators for the building up of a mass revolutionary working-class 
party, by the summer of 1914 the Bolsheviks had succeeded in winning 
the support of four-fifths of the politically active workers of Russia for 
the Bolshevik Party and for the Pravda tactics. This was borne out, 
for instance, by the fact that out of a total number of 7,000 workers¹ 
groups which collected money for the labour press in 1914, 5,600 
groups collected for the Bolshevik press, and only 1,400 groups for the 
Menshevik press. But, on the other hand, the Mensheviks had a large 
number of ³rich friends² among the liberal bourgeoisie and the bourgeois 
intelligentsia who advanced over half the funds required for the 
maintenance of the Menshevik newspaper. 
The Bolsheviks at that time were called ³Pravdists.² A whole generation 
of the revolutionary proletariat was reared by Pravda, the 
generation which subsequently made the October Socialist Revolution. 
Pravda was backed by tens and hundreds of thousands of workers. During 
the rise of the revolutionary movement (1912-14) the solid founda

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 154 
tion was laid of a mass Bolshevik Party, a foundation which no persecution 
by tsardom could destroy during the imperialist war. 
³The Pravda of 1912 was the laying of the corner-stone of the 
victory of Bolshevism in 1917.² (Stalin.) 
Another legally functioning central organ of the Party was the Bolshevik 
group in the Fourth State Duma. 
In 1912 the government decreed elections to the Fourth Duma. Our 
Party attributed great importance to participation in the elections. The 
Duma Social-Democratic group and Pravda were the chief bases of the 
revolutionary work of the Bolshevik Party among the masses, functioning 
legally on a countrywide scale. 
The Bolshevik Party acted independently, under its own slogans, in 
the Duma elections, simultaneously attacking both the government parties 
and the liberal bourgeoisie (Constitutional-Democrats). The slogans of 
the Bolsheviks in the election campaign were a democratic republic, an 
8-hour day and the confiscation of the landed estates. 
The elections to the Fourth Duma were held in the autumn of 1912. 
At the beginning of October, the government, dissatisfied with the course 
of the elections in St. Petersburg, tried to encroach on the electoral rights 
of the workers in a number of the large factories. In reply, the St. 
Petersburg Committee of our Party, on Comrade Stalin¹s proposal, 
called upon the workers of the large factories to declare a one-day strike. 
Placed in a difficult position, the government was forced to yield, and 
the workers were able at their meetings to elect whom they wanted. The 
vast majority of the workers voted for the Mandate (Nakaz) to their 
delegates and the deputy, which had been drawn up by Comrade Stalin. 
The ³Mandate of the Workingmen of St. Petersburg to Their Labour 
Deputy² called attention to the unaccomplished tasks of 1905. 
³We think,² the Mandate stated, ³that Russia is on the eve of 
the onset of mass movements, which will perhaps be more profound 
than in 1905. . . . As in 1905, in the van of these movements will be 
the most advanced class in Russian society, the Russian proletariat. 
Its only ally can be the much-suffering peasantry, which is vitally 
interested in the emancipation of Russia.² 
The Mandate declared that the future actions of the people should 
take the form of a struggle on two frontsagainst the tsarist government 
and against the liberal bourgeoisie, which was seeking to come to 
terms with tsardom. 
Lenin attached great importance to the Mandate, which called the

155 1 9 1 2 - 1 9 1 4 
workers to a revolutionary struggle. And in their resolutions the workers 
responded to this call. 
The Bolsheviks scored a victory in the elections, and Comrade Badayev 
was elected to the Duma by the workers of St. Petersburg. 
The workers voted in the elections to the Duma separately from 
other sections of the population (this was known as the worker curia). 
Of the nine deputies elected from the worker curia, six were members 
of the Bolshevik Party: Badayev, Petrovsky, Muranov, Samoilov, Shagov 
and Malinovsky (the latter subsequently turned out to be an agentprovocateur). 
The Bolshevik deputies were elected from the big industrial 
centres, in which not less than four-fifths of the working class were 
concentrated. On the other hand, several of the elected Liquidators did 
not get their mandates from the worker curia, that is, were not elected 
by the workers. The result was that there were seven Liquidators in 
the Duma as against six Bolsheviks. At first the Bolsheviks and Liquidators 
formed a joint Social-Democratic group in the Duma. In October 
1913, after a stubborn struggle against the Liquidators, who hampered 
the revolutionary work of the Bolsheviks, the Bolshevik deputies, on the 
instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, withdrew from the 
joint Social-Democratic group and formed an independent Bolshevik 
group. 
The Bolshevik deputies made revolutionary speeches in the Duma in 
which they exposed the autocratic system and interpellated the government 
on cases of repression of the workers and on the inhuman exploitation 
of the workers by the capitalists. 
They also spoke in the Duma on the agrarian question, calling upon 
the peasants to fight the feudal landlords, and exposing the Constitutional-
Democratic Party, which was opposed to the confiscation and 
handing over of the landed estates to the peasants. 
The Bolsheviks introduced a bill in the State Duma providing for 
an 8-hour working day; of course it was not adopted by this Black- 
Hundred Duma, but it had great agitational value. 
The Bolshevik group in the Duma maintained close connections with 
the Central Committee of the Party and with Lenin, from whom they 
received instructions. They were directly guided by Comrade Stalin 
while he was living in St. Petersburg. 
The Bolshevik deputies did not confine themselves to work within 
the Duma, but were very active outside the Duma as well. They visited 
mills and factories and toured the working-class centres of the country 
where they made speeches, arranged secret meetings at which they ex

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 156 
plained the decisions of the Party, and formed new Party organizations. 
The deputies skilfully combined legal activities with illegal, underground 
work. 
3. VICTORY OF THE BOLSHEVIKS IN THE LEGALLY EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS. 
CONTINUED RISE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY 
MOVEMENT. EVE OF THE IMPERIALIST WAR 
The Bolshevik Party during this period set an example of leadership 
in all forms and manifestations of the class struggle of the proletariat. 
It built up illegal organizations. It issued illegal leaflets. It carried on 
secret revolutionary work among the masses. At the same time it steadily 
gained the leadership of the various legally existing organizations of 
the working class. The Party strove to win over the trade unions and 
gain influence in People¹s Houses, evening universities, clubs and sick 
benefit societies. These legally existing organizations had long served as 
the refuge of the Liquidators. The Bolsheviks started an energetic struggle 
to convert the legally existing societies into strongholds of our Party. 
By skilfully combining illegal work with legal work, the Bolsheviks won 
over a majority of the trade union organizations in the two capital cities, 
St. Petersburg and Moscow. Particularly brilliant was the victory gained 
in the election of the Executive Committee of the Metal Workers¹ 
Union in St. Petersburg in 1913; of the 3,000 metal workers attending 
the meeting, barely 150 voted for the Liquidators. 
The same may be said of so important a legal organization as the 
Social-Democratic group in the Fourth State Duma. Although the Mensheviks 
had seven deputies in the Duma and the Bolsheviks six, the 
Menshevik deputies, chiefly elected from non-working class districts, represented 
barely one-fifth of the working class, whereas the Bolshevik 
deputies, who were elected from the principal industrial centres of the 
country (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Gostroma, Ekaterinoslav 
and Kharkov), represented over four-fifths of the working 
class of the country. The workers regarded the six Bolsheviks (Badayev, 
Petrovsky and the others) and not the seven Mensheviks as their deputies. 
The Bolsheviks succeeded in winning over the legally existing organizations 
because, in spite of savage persecution by the tsarist government 
and vilification by the Liquidators and the Trotskyites, they were able 
to preserve the illegal Party and maintain firm discipline in their ranks, 
they staunchly defended the interests of the working class, had close connections 
with the masses, and waged an uncompromising struggle against 
the enemies of the working-class movement.

157 1 9 1 2 - 1 9 1 4 
Thus the victory of the Bolsheviks and the defeat of the Mensheviks 
in the legally existing organizations developed all along the line. Both 
in respect to agitational work from the platform of the Duma and in 
respect to the labour press and other legally existing organizations, the 
Mensheviks were forced into the background. The revolutionary movement 
took strong hold of the working class, which definitely rallied 
around the Bolsheviks and swept the Mensheviks aside. 
To culminate all, the Mensheviks also proved bankrupt as far as the 
national question was concerned. The revolutionary movement in the 
border regions of Russia demanded a clear program on the national 
question. But the Mensheviks had no program, except the ³cultural 
autonomy² of the Bund, which could satisfy nobody. Only the Bolsheviks 
had a Marxist program on the national question, as set forth in 
Comrade Stalin¹s article, ³Marxism and the National Question,² and in 
Lenin¹s articles, ³The Right of Nations to Self-Determination² and 
³Critical Notes on the National Question.² 
It is not surprising that after the Mensheviks had suffered such defeats, 
the August Bloc should begin to break up. Composed as it was of 
heterogeneous elements, it could not withstand the onslaught of the 
Bolsheviks and began to fall apart. Formed for the purpose of combating 
Bolshevism, the August Bloc soon went to pieces under the blows of the 
Bolsheviks. The first to quit the bloc were the Vperyod-ites (Bogdanov, 
Lunacharsky and others); next went the Letts, and the rest followed 
suit.
Having suffered defeat in their struggle against the Bolsheviks, the 
Liquidators appealed for help to the Second International. The Second 
International came to their aid. Under the pretence of acting as a ³conciliator² 
between the Bolsheviks and the Liquidators, and establishing 
³peace in the Party,² the Second International demanded that the 
Bolsheviks should desist from criticizing the compromising policy of the 
Liquidators. But the Bolsheviks were irreconcilable: they refused to 
abide by the decisions of the opportunist Second International and would 
agree to make no concessions. 
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the legally existing organizations 
was not, and could not have been, accidental. It was not accidental, not 
only because the Bolsheviks alone had a correct Marxist theory, a clear 
program, and a revolutionary proletarian party which had been steeled 
and tempered in battle, but also because the victory of the Bolsheviks 
reflected the rising tide of revolution. 
The revolutionary movement of the workers steadily developed, 
spreading to town after town and region after region. In the beginning

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 158 
of 1914, the workers¹ strikes, far from subsiding, acquired a new momentum. 
They became more and more stubborn and embraced ever 
larger numbers of workers. On January 9, 250,000 workers were on 
strike, St. Petersburg accounting for 140,000. On May 1, over half 
a million workers were on strike, St. Petersburg accounting for more 
than 250,000. The workers displayed unusual steadfastness in the strikes. 
A strike at the Obukhov Works in St. Petersburg lasted for over two 
months, and another at the Lessner Works for about three months. 
Wholesale poisoning of workers at a number of St. Petersburg factories 
was the cause of a strike of 115,000 workers which was accompanied by 
demonstrations. The movement continued to spread. In the first half 
of 1914 (including the early part of July) a total of 1,425,000 workers 
took part in strikes. 
In May a general strike of oil workers, which broke out in Baku, 
focussed the attention of the whole proletariat of Russia. The strike was 
conducted in an organized way. On June 20 a demonstration of 20,000 
workers was held in Baku. The police adopted ferocious measures against 
the Baku workers. A strike broke out in Moscow as a mark of protest 
and solidarity with the Baku workers and spread to other districts. 
On July 3 a meeting was held at the Putilov Works in St. Petersburg 
in connection with the Baku strike. The police fired on the workers. 
A wave of indignation swept over the St. Petersburg proletariat. 
On July 4, at the call of the St. Petersburg Party Committee, 90,000 
St. Petersburg workers stopped work in protest; the number rose to 
130,000 on July 7, 150,000 on July 8 and 200,000 on July 11. 
Unrest spread to all the factories, and meetings and demonstrations 
were held everywhere. The workers even started to throw up barricades. 
Barricades were erected also in Baku and Lodz. In a number of places 
the police fired on the workers. The government adopted ³emergency² 
measures to suppress the movement; the capital was turned into an 
armed camp; Pravda was suppressed. 
But at that moment a new factor, one of international import, 
appeared on the arena. This was the imperialist war, which was to 
change the whole course of events. It was during the revolutionary 
developments of July that Poincaré, the French President, arrived in 
St. Petersburg to discuss with the tsar the war that was about to begin. 
A few days later Germany declared war on Russia. The tsarist government 
took advantage of the war to smash the Bolshevik organizations 
and to crush the working-class movement. The advance of the revolution 
was interrupted by the World War, in which the tsarist government 
sought salvation from revolution.

B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
During the period of the new rise of the revolution (1912-14), the 
Bolshevik Party headed the working-class movement and led it forward 
to a new revolution under Bolshevik slogans. The Party ably combined 
illegal work with legal work. Smashing the resistance of the Liquidators 
and their friendsthe Trotskyites and Otzoviststhe Party gained 
the leadership of all forms of the legal movement and turned the legally 
existing organizations into bases of its revolutionary work. 
In the fight against the enemies of the working class and their agents 
within the working-class movement, the Party consolidated its ranks 
and extended its connections with the working class. Making wide use 
of the Duma as a platform for revolutionary agitation, and having 
founded a splendid mass workers¹ newspaper, Pravda, the Party trained 
a new generation of revolutionary workersthe Pravdists. During the 
imperialist war this section of the workers remained faithful to the banner 
of internationalism and proletarian revolution. It subsequently 
formed the core of the Bolshevik Party during the revolution of October 
1917.
On the eve of the imperialist war the Party led the working class 
in its revolutionary actions. These were vanguard engagements which 
were interrupted by the imperialist war only to be resumed three years 
later to end in the overthrow of tsardom. The Bolshevik Party entered 
the difficult period of the imperialist war with the banners of proletarian 
internationalism unfurled.

THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY IN THE PERIOD 
OF THE IMPERIALIST WAR. 
THE SECOND REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA 
( 1 9 1 4 - MARCH 1 9 1 7 ) 
1. OUTBREAK AND CAUSES OF THE IMPERIALIST WAR 
On July 14 (27, New Style), 1914, the tsarist government proclaimed 
a general mobilization. On July 19 (August 1, New Style) 
Germany declared war on Russia. 
Russia entered the war. 
Long before the actual outbreak of the war the Bolsheviks, headed 
by Lenin, had foreseen that it was inevitable. At international Socialist 
congresses Lenin had put forward proposals the purpose of which was 
to determine a revolutionary line of conduct for the Socialists in the 
event of war. 
Lenin had pointed out that war is an inevitable concomitant of capitalism. 
Plunder of foreign territory, seizure and spoliation of colonies 
and the capture of new markets had many times already served as causes 
of wars of conquest waged by capitalist states. For capitalist countries 
war is just as natural and legitimate a condition of things as the exploitation 
of the working class. 
Wars became inevitable particularly when, at the end of the nineteenth 
century and the beginning of the twentieth century, capitalism 
definitely entered the highest and last stage of its developmentimperialism. 
Under imperialism the powerful capitalist associations (monopolies) 
and the banks acquired a dominant position in the life of the capitalist 
states. Finance capital became master in the capitalist states. Finance 
capital demanded new markets, the seizure of new colonies, new fields 
for the export of capital, new sources of raw material. 
But by the end of the nineteenth century the whole territory of the 
globe had already been divided up among the capitalist states. Yet in 
the era of imperialism the development of capitalism proceeds extremely 
unevenly and by leaps: some countries, which previously held a foremost 
position, now develop their industry at a relatively slow rate, while 
others, which were formerly backward, overtake and outstrip them by 
160

161 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
rapid leaps. The relative economic and military strength of the imperialist 
states was undergoing a change. There arose a striving for a redivision 
of the world, and the struggle for this redivision made imperialist 
war inevitable. The war of 1914 was a war for the redivision of the 
world and of spheres of influence. All the imperialist states had long 
been preparing for it. The imperialists of all countries were responsible 
for the war. 
But in particular, preparations for this war were made by Germany 
and Austria, on the one hand, and by France and Great Britain, as 
well as by Russia, which was dependent on the latter two, on the other. 
The Triple Entente, an alliance of Great Britain, France and Russia, 
was formed in 1907. Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy formed 
another imperialist alliance. But on the outbreak of the war of 1914 
Italy left this alliance and later joined the Entente. Germany and 
Austria-Hungary were supported by Bulgaria and Turkey. 
Germany prepared for the imperialist war with the design of taking 
away colonies from Great Britain and France, and the Ukraine, Poland 
and the Baltic Provinces from Russia. By building the Baghdad railway, 
Germany created a menace to Britain¹s domination in the Near 
East. Great Britain feared the growth of Germany¹s naval armaments. 
Tsarist Russia strove for the partition of Turkey and dreamed of 
seizing Constantinople and the straits leading from the Black Sea to the 
Mediterranean (the Dardanelles). The plans of the tsarist government 
also included the seizure of Galicia, a part of Austria-Hungary. 
Great Britain strove by means of war to smash its dangerous competitor
Germanywhose goods before the war were steadily driving 
British goods out of the world markets. In addition, Great Britain 
intended to seize Mesopotamia and Palestine from Turkey and to secure 
a firm foothold in Egypt. 
The French capitalists strove to take away from Germany the Saar 
Basin and Alsace-Lorraine, two rich coal and iron regions, the latter of 
which Germany had seized from France in the war of 1870-71. 
Thus the imperialist war was brought about by profound antagonisms 
between two groups of capitalist states. 
This rapacious war for the redivision of the world affected the interests 
of all the imperialist countries, with the result that Japan, the United 
States and a number of other countries were subsequently drawn into it. 
The war became a world war. 
The bourgeoisie kept the preparations for imperialist war a profound 
secret from their people. When the war broke out each imperialist gov

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 162 
ernment endeavoured to prove that it had not attacked its neighbours, 
but had been attacked by them. The bourgeoisie deceived the people, 
concealing the true aims of the war and its imperialist, annexationist 
character. Each imperialist government declared that it was waging 
war in defence of its country. 
The opportunists of the Second International helped the bourgeoisie 
to deceive the people. The Social-Democrats of the Second International 
vilely betrayed the cause of Socialism, the cause of the international 
solidarity of the proletariat. Far from opposing the war, they 
assisted the bourgeoisie in inciting the workers and peasants of the belligerent 
countries against each other on the plea of defending the fatherland.
That Russia entered the imperialist war on the side of the Entente, 
on the side of France and Great Britain, was not accidental. It should 
be borne in mind that before 1914 the most important branches of Russian 
industry were in the hands of foreign capitalists, chiefly those of 
France, Great Britain and Belgium, that is, the Entente countries. The 
most important of Russia¹s metal works were in the hands of French 
capitalists. In all, about three-quarters (72 per cent) of the metal industry 
depended on foreign capital. The same was true of the coal 
industry of the Donetz Basin. Oilfields owned by British and French 
capital accounted for about half the oil output of the country. A considerable 
part of the profits of Russian industry flowed into foreign banks, 
chiefly British and French. All these circumstances, in addition to the 
thousands of millions borrowed by the tsar from France and Britain in 
loans, chained tsardom to British and French imperialism and converted 
Russia into a tributary, a semi-colony of these countries. 
The Russian bourgeoisie went to war with the purpose of improving 
its position: to seize new markets, to make huge profits on war contracts, 
and at the same time to crush the revolutionary movement by taking 
advantage of the war situation. 
Tsarist Russia was not ready for war. Russian industry lagged far 
behind that of other capitalist countries. It consisted predominantly of 
out-of-date mills and factories with worn-out machinery. Owing to the 
existence of land ownership based on semi-serfdom, and the vast numbers 
of impoverished and ruined peasants, her agriculture could not provide 
a solid economic base for a prolonged war. 
The chief mainstay of the tsar was the feudal landlords. The Black- 
Hundred big landlords, in alliance with the big capitalists, domineered 
the country and the State Duma. They wholly supported the home 
and foreign policy of the tsarist government. The Russian imperialist

163 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
bourgeoisie placed its hopes in the tsarist autocracy as a mailed fist that 
could ensure the seizure of new markets and new territories, on the 
one hand, and crush the revolutionary movement of the workers and 
peasants, on the other. 
The party of the liberal bourgeoisiethe Constitutional-Democratic 
Partymade a show of opposition, but supported the foreign policy of 
the tsarist government unreservedly. 
From the very outbreak of the war, the petty-bourgeois parties, the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, using the flag of Socialism 
as a screen, helped the bourgeoisie to deceive the people by concealing 
the imperialist, predatory character of the war. They preached the necessity 
of defending, of protecting the bourgeois ³fatherland² from the 
³Prussian barbarians²; they supported a policy of ³civil peace,² and thus 
helped the government of the Russian tsar to wage war, just as the 
German Social-Democrats helped the government of the German kaiser 
to wage war on the ³Russian barbarians.² 
Only the Bolshevik Party remained faithful to the great cause of 
revolutionary internationalism and firmly adhered to the Marxist position 
of a resolute struggle against the tsarist autocracy, against the landlords 
and capitalists, against the imperialist war. From the very outbreak of 
the war the Bolshevik Party maintained that it had been started, not 
for the defence of the country, but for the seizure of foreign territory, 
for the spoliation of foreign nations in the interests of the landlords and 
capitalists, and that the workers must wage a determined war on this war. 
The working class supported the Bolshevik Party. 
True, the bourgeois jingoism displayed in the early days of the war 
by the intelligentsia and the kulak sections of the peasantry also infected 
a certain section of the workers. But these were chiefly members of the 
ruffian ³League of the Russian People² and some workers who were 
under the influence of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
They naturally did not, and could not, reflect the sentiments of the 
working class. It was these elements who took part in the jingo demonstrations 
of the bourgeoisie engineered by the tsarist government in the 
early days of the war. 
2. PARTIES OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL SIDE WITH THEIR 
IMPERIALIST GOVERNMENTS. DISINTEGRATION OF THE SECOND 
INTERNATIONAL INTO SEPARATE SOCIAL-CHAUVINIST PARTIES 
Lenin had time and again warned against the opportunism of the 
Second International and the wavering attitude of its leaders. He had

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 164 
always insisted that the leaders of the Second International only talked 
of being opposed to war, and that if war were to break out they would 
change their attitude, desert to the side of the imperialist bourgeoisie and 
become supporters of the war. What Lenin had foretold was borne out 
in the very first days of the war. 
In 1910, at the Copenhagen Congress of the Second International, 
it was decided that Socialists in parliament should vote against war credits. 
At the time of the Balkan War of 1912, the Basle World Congress of 
the Second International declared that the workers of all countries considered 
it a crime to shoot one another for the sake of increasing the 
profits of the capitalists. That is what they said, that is what they proclaimed 
in their resolutions. 
But when the storm burst, when the imperialist war broke out, and 
the time had come to put these decisions into effect, the leaders of the 
Second International proved to be traitors, betrayers of the proletariat 
and servitors of the bourgeoisie. They became supporters of the war. 
On August 4, 1914, the German Social-Democrats in parliament 
voted for the war credits; they voted to support the imperialist war. 
So did the overwhelming majority of the Socialists in France, Great 
Britain, Belgium and other countries. 
The Second International ceased to exist. Actually it broke up into 
separate social-chauvinist parties which warred against each other. 
The leaders of the Socialist parties betrayed the proletariat and 
adopted the position of social-chauvinism and defence of the imperialist 
bourgeoisie. They helped the imperialist governments to hoodwink the 
working class and to poison it with the venom of nationalism. Using 
the defence of the fatherland as a plea, these social-traitors began to 
incite the German workers against the French workers, and the British 
and French workers against the German workers. Only an insignificant 
minority of the Second International kept to the internationalist position 
and went against the current; true, they did not do so confidently and 
definitely enough, but go against the current they did. 
Only the Bolshevik Party immediately and unhesitatingly raised the 
banner of determined struggle against the imperialist war. In the theses 
on the war that Lenin wrote in the autumn of 1914, he pointed out 
that the fall of the Second International was not accidental. The Second 
International had been ruined by the opportunists, against whom the 
foremost representatives of the revolutionary proletariat had long been 
warning. 
The parties of the Second International had already been infected 
by opportunism before the war. The opportunists had openly preached

165 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
renunciation of the revolutionary struggle; they had preached the theory 
of the ³peaceful growing of capitalism into Socialism.² The Second International 
did not want to combat opportunism; it wanted to live in 
peace with opportunism, and allowed it to gain a firm hold. Pursuing 
a conciliatory policy towards opportunism, the Second International itself 
became opportunist. 
The imperialist bourgeoisie systematically bribed the upper stratum 
of skilled workers, the so-called labour aristocracy, by means of higher 
wages and other sops, using for this purpose part of the profits it derived 
from the colonies, from the exploitation of backward countries. This 
section of workers had produced quite a number of trade union and cooperative 
leaders, members of municipal and parliamentary bodies, journalists 
and functionaries of Social-Democratic organizations. When the 
war broke out, these people, fearing to lose their positions, became foes 
of revolution and most zealous defenders of their own bourgeoisies, of 
their own imperialist governments. 
The opportunists became social-chauvinists. 
The social-chauvinists, the Russian Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
among their number, preached class peace between the workers 
and the bourgeoisie at home and war on other nations abroad. They 
deceived the masses by concealing from them who was really responsible 
for the war and declaring that the bourgeoisie of their particular country 
was not to blame. Many social-chauvinists became ministers of the imperialist 
governments of their countries. 
No less dangerous to the cause of the proletariat were the covert 
social-chauvinists, the so-called Centrists. The CentristsKautsky, 
Trotsky, Martov and othersjustified and defended the avowed socialchauvinists, 
thus joining the social-chauvinists in betraying the proletariat; 
they masked their treachery by ³Leftist² talk about combating the war, 
talk designed to deceive the working class. As a matter of fact, the 
Centrists supported the war, for their proposal not to vote against war 
credits, but merely to abstain when a vote on the credits was being taken, 
meant supporting the war. Like the social-chauvinists, they demanded 
the renunciation of the class struggle during the war so as not to hamper 
their particular imperialist government in waging the war. The Centrist 
Trotsky opposed Lenin and the Bolshevik Party on all the important 
questions of the war and Socialism. 
From the very outbreak of the war Lenin began to muster forces 
for the creation of a new International, the Third International. In 
the manifesto against the war it issued in November 1914, the Central 
Committee of the Bolshevik Party already called for the formation of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 166 
the Third International in place of the Second International which had 
suffered disgraceful bankruptcy. 
In February 1915, a conference of Socialists of the Entente countries 
was held in London. Comrade Litvinov, on Lenin¹s instructions, spoke 
at this conference demanding that the Socialists (Vandervelde, Sembat 
and Guesde) should resign from the bourgeois government of Belgium 
and France, completely break with the imperialists and refuse to collaborate 
with them. He demanded that all Socialists should wage a determined 
struggle against their imperialist governments and condemn the 
voting of war credits. But no voice in support of Litvinov was raised 
at this conference. 
At the beginning of September 1915 the first conference of internationalists 
was held in Zimmerwald. Lenin called this conference the 
³first step² in the development of an international movement against the 
war. At this conference Lenin formed the Zimmerwald Left group. 
But within the Zimmerwald Left group only the Bolshevik Party, headed 
by Lenin, took a correct and thoroughly consistent stand against the war. 
The Zimmerwald Left group published a magazine in German called 
the Vorbote (Herald), to which Lenin contributed articles. 
In 1916 the internationalists succeeded in convening a second conference 
in the Swiss village of Kienthal. It is known as the Second Zimmerwald 
Conference. By this time groups of internationalists had been 
formed in nearly every country and the cleavage between the internationalist 
elements and the social-chauvinists had become more sharply defined. 
But the most important thing was that by this time the masses 
themselves had shifted to the Left under the influence of the war and 
its attendant distress. The manifesto drawn up by the Kienthal Conference 
was the result of an agreement between various conflicting 
groups; it was an advance on the Zimmerwald Manifesto. 
But like the Zimmerwald Conference, the Kienthal Conference did 
not accept the basic principles of the Bolshevik policy, namely, the conversion 
of the imperialist war into a civil war, the defeat of one¹s own 
imperialist government in the war, and the formation of the Third International. 
Nevertheless, the Kienthal Conference helped to crystallize 
the internationalist elements of whom the Communist Third International 
was subsequently formed. 
Lenin criticized the mistakes of the inconsistent internationalists among 
the Left Social-Democrats, such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, 
but at the same time he helped them to take the correct position.

167 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
3. THEORY AND TACTICS OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY ON THE 
QUESTION OF WAR, PEACE AND REVOLUTION 
The Bolsheviks were not mere pacifists who sighed for peace and 
confined themselves to the propaganda of peace, as the majority of the 
Left Social-Democrats did. The Bolsheviks advocated an active revolutionary 
struggle for peace, to the point of overthrowing the rule of 
the bellicose imperialist bourgeoisie. The Bolsheviks linked up the cause 
of peace with the cause of the victory of the proletarian revolution, holding 
that the surest way of ending the war and securing a just peace, a 
peace without annexations and indemnities, was to overthrow the rule 
of the imperialist bourgeoisie. 
In opposition to the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary renunciation 
of revolution and their treacherous slogan of preserving ³civil 
peace² in time of war, the Bolsheviks advanced the slogan of ³converting 
the imperialist war into a civil, war.² This slogan meant that the labouring 
people, including the armed workers and peasants clad in soldiers¹ 
uniform, were to turn their weapons against their own bourgeoisie and 
overthrow its rule if they wanted to put an end to the war and achieve 
a just peace. 
In opposition to the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary policy of 
defending the bourgeois fatherland, the Bolsheviks advanced the policy 
of ³the defeat of one¹s own government in the imperialist war.² This 
meant voting against war credits, forming illegal revolutionary organizations 
in the armed forces, supporting fraternization among the soldiers 
at the front, organizing revolutionary actions of the workers and peasants 
against the war, and turning these actions into an uprising against 
one¹s own imperialist government. 
The Bolsheviks maintained that the lesser evil for the people would 
be the military defeat of the tsarist government in the imperialist war, 
for this would facilitate the victory of the people over tsardom and the 
success of the struggle of the working class for emancipation from capitalist 
slavery and imperialist wars. Lenin held that the policy of working 
for the defeat of one¹s own imperialist government must be pursued not 
only by the Russian revolutionaries, but by the revolutionary parties of 
the working class in all the belligerent countries. 
It was not to every kind of war that the Bolsheviks were opposed. 
They were only opposed to wars of conquest, imperialist wars. The 
Bolsheviks held that there are two kinds of war: 
a) Just wars, wars that are not wars of conquest but wars of liberation, 
waged to defend the people from foreign attack and from attempt

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 168 
to enslave them, or to liberate the people from capitalist slavery, or, 
lastly, to liberate colonies and dependent countries from the yoke of 
imperialism; and 
b) Unjust wars, wars of conquest, waged to conquer and enslave 
foreign countries and foreign nations. 
Wars of the first kind the Bolsheviks supported. As to wars of the 
second kind, the Bolsheviks maintained that a resolute struggle must be 
waged against them to the point of revolution and the overthrow of 
one¹s own imperialist government. 
Of great importance to the working class of the world was Lenin¹s 
theoretical work during the war. In the spring of 1916 Lenin wrote 
a book entitled Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In this 
book he showed that imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism, a stage 
at which it has already become transformed from ³progressive² capitalism 
to parasitic capitalism, decaying capitalism, and that imperialism is 
moribund capitalism. This, of course, did not mean that capitalism would 
die away of itself, without a revolution of the proletariat, that it would 
just rot on the stalk. Lenin always taught that without a revolution of 
the working class capitalism cannot be overthrown. Therefore, while 
defining imperialism as moribund capitalism, Lenin at the same time 
showed that ³imperialism is the eve of the social revolution of the 
proletariat.² 
Lenin showed that in the era of imperialism the capitalist yoke becomes 
more and more oppressive, that under imperialism the revolt of 
the proletariat against the foundations of capitalism grows, and that the 
elements of a revolutionary outbreak accumulate in capitalist countries. 
Lenin showed that in the era of imperialism the revolutionary crisis 
in the colonial and dependent countries becomes more acute, that the 
elements of revolt against imperialism, the elements of a war of liberation 
from imperialism accumulate. 
Lenin showed that under imperialism the unevenness of development 
and the contradictions of capitalism have grown particularly acute, 
that the struggle for markets and fields for the export of capital, the 
struggle for colonies, for sources of raw material, makes periodical imperialist 
wars for the redivision of the world inevitable. 
Lenin showed that it is just this unevenness of development of capitalism 
that gives rise to imperialist wars, which undermine the strength 
of imperialism and make it possible to break the front of imperialism at 
its weakest point. 
From all this Lenin drew the conclusion that it was quite possible for 
the proletariat to break the imperialist front in one place or in several

169 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
places, that the victory of Socialism was possible first in several countries 
or even in one country, taken singly, that the simultaneous victory of 
Socialism in all countries was impossible owing to the unevenness of development 
of capitalism, and that Socialism would be victorious first in 
one country or in several countries, while the others would remain 
bourgeois countries for some time longer. 
Here is the formulation of this brilliant deduction as given by Lenin 
in two articles written during the imperialist war: 
1) ³Uneven economic and political development is an absolute 
law of capitalism. Hence, the victory of Socialism is possible first in 
several or even in one capitalist country, taken singly. The victorious 
proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and 
organized its own Socialist production, would stand up against the 
rest of the world, the capitalist world, attracting to its cause the oppressed 
classes of other countries. . . .² (From the article, ³The 
United States of Europe Slogan,² written in August, 1915.Lenin, 
Selected Works, Vol. V, p. 141.) 
2) ³The development of capitalism proceeds extremely unevenly 
in the various countries. It cannot be otherwise under the commodity 
production system. From this it follows irrefutably that Socialism 
cannot achieve victory simultaneously in all countries. It will achieve 
victory first in one or several countries, while the others will remain 
bourgeois or pre-bourgeois for some time. This must not only create 
friction, but a direct striving on the part of the bourgeoisie of other 
countries to crush the victorious proletariat of the Socialist country. 
In such cases a war on our part would be a legitimate and just war. 
It would be a war for Socialism, for the liberation of other nations 
from the bourgeoisie.² (From the article, ³War Program of the 
Proletarian Revolution,² written in the autumn of 1916.Lenin, 
Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XIX, p. 325.) 
This was a new and complete theory of the Socialist revolution, a 
theory affirming the possibility of the victory of Socialism in separate 
countries, and indicating the conditions of this victory and its prospects, 
a theory whose fundamentals were outlined by Lenin as far back as 
1905 in his pamphlet, Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic 
Revolution. 
This theory fundamentally differed from the view current among the 
Marxists in the period of pre-imperialist capitalism, when they held that 
the victory of Socialism in one separate country was impossible, and that 
it would take place simultaneously in all the civilized countries. On the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 170 
basis of the facts concerning imperialist capitalism set forth in his remarkable 
book, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin displaced 
this view as obsolete and set forth a new theory, from which it follows 
that the simultaneous victory of Socialism in all countries is impossible, 
while the victory of Socialism in one capitalist country, taken singly, is 
possible. 
The inestimable importance of Lenin¹s theory of Socialist revolution 
lies not only in the fact that it has enriched Marxism with a new theory 
and has advanced Marxism, but also in the fact that it opens up a revolutionary 
perspective for the proletarians of separate countries, that it 
unfetters their initiative in the onslaught on their own, national bourgeoisie, 
that it teaches them to take advantage of a war situation to 
organize this onslaught, and that it strengthens their faith in the victory 
of the proletarian revolution. 
Such was the theoretical and tactical stand of the Bolsheviks on the 
questions of war, peace and revolution. 
It was on the basis of this stand that the Bolsheviks carried on their 
practical work in Russia. 
At the beginning of the war, in spite of severe persecution by the 
police, the Bolshevik members of the DumaBadayev, Petrovsky, Muranov, 
Samoilov and Shagovvisited a number of organizations and 
addressed them on the policy of the Bolsheviks towards the war and 
revolution. In November 1914 a conference of the Bolshevik group 
in the State Duma was convened to discuss policy towards the war. 
On the third day of the conference all present were arrested. The court 
sentenced the Bolshevik members of the State Duma to forfeiture of 
civil rights and banishment to Eastern Siberia. The tsarist government 
charged them with ³high treason.² 
The picture of the activities of the Duma members unfolded in 
court did credit to our Party. The Bolshevik deputies conducted themselves 
manfully, transforming the tsarist court into a platform from 
which they exposed the annexationist policy of tsardom. 
Quite different was the conduct of Kamenev, who was also tried 
in this case. Owing to his cowardice, he abjured the policy of the Bolshevik 
Party at the first contact with danger. Kamenev declared in 
court that he did not agree with the Bolsheviks on the question of the 
war, and to prove this he requested that the Menshevik Jordansky be 
summoned as witness. 
The Bolsheviks worked very effectively against the War Industry 
Committees set up to serve the needs of war, and against the attempts of 
the Mensheviks to bring the workers under the influence of the impe

171 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
rialist bourgeoisie. It was of vital interest to the bourgeoisie to make 
everybody believe that the imperialist war was a people¹s war. During 
the war the bourgeoisie managed to attain considerable influence in affairs 
of state and set up a countrywide organization of its own known as the 
Unions of Zemstvos and Towns. It was necessary for the bourgeoisie to 
bring the workers, too, under its leadership and influence. It conceived a 
way to do this, namely, by forming ³Workers¹ Groups² of the War 
Industry Committees. The Mensheviks jumped at this idea. It was 
to the advantage of the bourgeoisie to have on these War Industry Committees 
representatives of the workers who would urge the working class 
masses to increase productivity of labour in the factories producing shells, 
guns, rifles, cartridges and other war material. ³Everything for the 
war, all for the war²was the slogan of the bourgeoisie. Actually, 
this slogan meant ³get as rich as you can on war contracts and seizures 
of foreign territory.² The Mensheviks took an active part in this pseudopatriotic 
scheme of the bourgeoisie. They helped the capitalists by conducting 
an intense campaign among the workers to get them to take 
part in the elections of the ³Workers¹ Groups² of the War Industry 
Committees. The Bolsheviks were against this scheme. They advocated 
a boycott of the War Industry Committees and were successful in 
securing this boycott. But some of the workers, headed by a prominent 
Menshevik, Gvozdev, and an agent-provocateur, Abrosimov, did take 
part in the activities of the War Industry Committees. When, however, 
the workers¹ delegates met, in September 1915, for the final elections of 
the ³Workers¹ Groups² of the War Industry Committees, it turned 
out that the majority of the delegates were opposed to participation in 
them. A majority of the workers¹ delegates adopted a trenchant resolution 
opposing participation in the War Industry Committees and declared 
that the workers had made it their aim to fight for peace and for the 
overthrow of tsardom. 
The Bolsheviks also developed extensive activities in the army and 
navy. They explained to the soldiers and sailors who was to blame for 
the unparalleled horrors of the war and the sufferings of the people; 
they explained that there was only one way out for the people from the 
imperialist shambles, and that was revolution. The Bolsheviks formed 
nuclei in the army and navy, at the front and in the rear, and distributed 
leaflets calling for a fight against the war. 
In Kronstadt, the Bolsheviks formed a ³Central Collective of the 
Kronstadt Military Organization² which had close connections with 
the Petrograd Committee of the Party. A military organization of the 
Petrograd Party Committee was set up for work among the garrison.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 172 
In August 1916, the chief of the Petrograd Okhrana reported that 
³in the Kronstadt Collective, things are very well organized, conspiratorially, 
and its members are all taciturn and cautious people. This Collective 
also has representatives on shore.² 
At the front, the Party agitated for fraternization between the soldiers 
of the warring armies, emphasizing the fact that the world bourgeoisie 
was the enemy, and that the war could be ended only by converting 
the imperialist war into a civil war and turning one¹s weapons against 
one¹s own bourgeoisie and its government. Cases of refusal of army 
units to take the offensive became more and more frequent. There were 
already such instances in 1915, and even more in 1916. 
Particularly extensive were the activities of the Bolsheviks in the 
armies on the Northern Front, in the Baltic provinces. At the beginning 
of 1917 General Ruzsky, Commander of the Army on the Northern 
Front, informed Headquarters that the Bolsheviks had developed intense 
revolutionary activities on that front. 
The war wrought a profound change in the life of the peoples, in 
the life of the working class of the world. The fate of states, the fate 
of nations, the fate of the Socialist movement was at stake. The war 
was therefore a touchstone, a test for all parties and trends calling themselves 
Socialist. Would these parties and trends remain true to the cause 
of Socialism, to the cause of internationalism, or would they choose to 
betray the working class, to furl their banners and lay them at the feet 
of their national bourgeoisie?that is how the question stood at the time. 
The war showed that the parties of the Second International had 
not stood the test, that they had betrayed the working class and had 
surrendered their banners to the imperialist bourgeoisie of their own 
countries. 
And these parties, which had cultivated opportunism in their midst, 
and which had been brought up to make concessions to the opportunists, 
to the nationalists, could not have acted differently. 
The war showed that the Bolshevik Party was the only party which 
had passed the test with flying colours and had remained consistently 
faithful to the cause of Socialism, the cause of proletarian internationalism.
And that was to be expected: only a party of a new type, only a 
party fostered in the spirit of uncompromising struggle against opportunism, 
only a party that was free from opportunism and nationalism, only 
such a party could stand the great test and remain faithful to the cause 
of the working class, to the cause of Socialism and internationalism. 
And the Bolshevik Party was such a party.

4. DEFEAT OF THE TSARIST ARMY. ECONOMIC DISRUPTION. CRISIS 
OF TSARDOM 
The war had already been in progress for three years. Millions of 
people had been killed in the war, or had died of wounds or from 
epidemics caused by war conditions. The bourgeoisie and landlords were 
making fortunes out of the war. But the workers and peasants were 
suffering increasing hardship and privation. The war was undermining 
the economic life of Russia. Some fourteen million able-bodied men 
had been torn from economic pursuits and drafted into the army. Mills 
and factories were coming to a standstill. The crop area had diminished 
owing to a shortage of labour. The population and the soldiers at the 
front went hungry, barefoot and naked. The war was eating up the 
resources of the country. 
The tsarist army suffered defeat after defeat. The German artillery 
deluged the tsarist troops with shells, while the tsarist army lacked guns, 
shells and even rifles. Sometimes three soldiers had to share one rifle. 
While the war was in progress it was discovered that Sukhomlinov, the 
tsar¹s Minister of War, was a traitor, who was connected with German 
spies, and was carrying out the instructions of the German espionage 
service to disorganize the supply of munitions and to leave the front 
without guns and rifles. Some of the tsarist ministers and generals surreptitiously 
assisted the success of the German army: together with the 
tsarina, who had German ties, they betrayed military secrets to the 
Germans. It is not surprising that the tsarist army suffered reverses 
and was forced to retreat. By 1916 the Germans had already seized 
Poland and part of the Baltic provinces. 
All this aroused hatred and anger against the tsarist government 
among the workers, peasants, soldiers and intellectuals, fostered and intensified 
the revolutionary movement of the masses against the war and 
against tsardom, both in the rear and at the front, in the central and 
in the border regions. 
Dissatisfaction also began to spread to the Russian imperialist bourgeoisie. 
It was incensed by the fact that rascals like Rasputin, who were 
obviously working for a separate peace with Germany, lorded it at the 
tsar¹s court. The bourgeoisie grew more and more convinced that the 
tsarist government was incapable of waging war successfully. It feared 
that the tsar might, in order to save his position, conclude a separate 
peace with the Germans. The Russian bourgeoisie therefore decided to 
engineer a palace coup with the object of deposing Tsar Nicholas II and 
replacing him by his brother, Michael Romanov, who was connected

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 174 
with the bourgeoisie. In this way it wanted to kill two birds with one 
stone: first, to get into power itself and ensure the further prosecution 
of the imperialist war, and, secondly, to prevent by a small palace coup 
the outbreak of a big popular revolution, the tide of which was swelling. 
In this the Russian bourgeoisie had the full support of the British 
and French governments who saw that the tsar was incapable of 
carrying on the war. They feared that he might end it by concluding 
a separate peace with the Germans. If the tsarist government were to 
sign a separate peace, the British and French governments would lose 
a war ally which not only diverted enemy forces to its own fronts, but 
also supplied France with tens of thousands of picked Russian soldiers. 
The British and French governments therefore supported the attempts 
of the Russian bourgeoisie to bring about a palace coup. 
The tsar was thus isolated. 
While defeat followed defeat at the front, economic disruption grew 
more and more acute. In January and February 1917 the extent and 
acuteness of the disorganization of the food, raw material and fuel supply 
reached a climax. The supply of foodstuffs to Petrograd and Moscow 
had almost ceased. One factory after another closed down and 
this aggravated unemployment. Particularly intolerable was the condition 
of the workers. Increasing numbers of the people were arriving 
at the conviction that the only way out of the intolerable situation was 
to overthrow the tsarist autocracy. 
Tsardom was clearly in the throes of a mortal crisis. 
The bourgeoisie thought of solving the crisis by a palace coup. 
But the people solved it in their own way. 
5. THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION. FALL OF TSARDOM. FORMATION 
OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS¹ AND SOLDIERS¹ DEPUTIES. FORMATION 
OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. DUAL POWER 
The year 1917 was inaugurated by the strike of January 9. In 
the course of this strike demonstrations were held in Petrograd, Moscow, 
Baku and Nizhni-Novgorod. In Moscow about one-third of the workers 
took part in the strike of January 9. A demonstration of two thousand 
persons on Tverskoi Boulevard was dispersed by mounted police. A 
demonstration on the Vyborg Chaussée in Petrograd was joined by 
soldiers. 
³The idea of a general strike,² the Petrograd police reported, ³is 
daily gaining new followers and is becoming as popular as it was in 
1905.²

175 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries tried to direct this 
incipient revolutionary movement into the channels the liberal bourgeoisie 
needed. The Mensheviks proposed that a procession of workers to the 
State Duma be organized on February 14, the day of its opening. But 
the working-class masses followed the Bolsheviks, and went, not to the 
Duma, but to a demonstration. 
On February 18, 1917, a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in 
Petrograd. On February 22 the workers of most of the big factories 
were on strike. On International Women¹s Day, February 23 (March 
8), at the call of the Petrograd Bolshevik Committee, working women 
came out in the streets to demonstrate against starvation, war and tsardom. 
The Petrograd workers supported the demonstration of the working 
women by a city-wide strike movement. The political strike began 
to grow into a general political demonstration against the tsarist system. 
On February 24 (March 9) the demonstration was resumed with 
even greater vigour. About 200,000 workers were already on strike. 
On February 25 (March 10) the whole of working-class Petrograd 
had joined the revolutionary movement. The political strikes in the 
districts merged into a general political strike of the whole city. Demonstrations 
and clashes with the police took place everywhere. Over the 
masses of workers floated red banners bearing the slogans: ³Down 
with the tsar!² ³Down with the war!² ³We want bread!² 
On the morning of February 26 (March 11) the political strike 
and demonstration began to assume the character of an uprising. The 
workers disarmed police and gendarmes and armed themselves. Nevertheless, 
the clashes with the police ended with the shooting down of a 
demonstration on Znamenskaya Square. 
General Khabalov, Commander of the Petrograd Military Area, 
announced that the workers must return to work by February 28 
(March 13), otherwise they would be sent to the front. On February 
25 (March 10) the tsar gave orders to General Khabalov: ³I command 
you to put a stop to the disorders in the capital not later than tomorrow.² 
But ³to put a stop² to the revolution was no longer possible. 
On February 26 (March 11) the 4th Company of the Reserve 
Battalion of the Pavlovsky Regiment opened fire, not on the workers, 
however, but on squads of mounted police who were engaged in a skirmish 
with the workers. A most energetic and persistent drive was made 
to win over the troops, especially by the working women, who addressed 
themselves directly to the soldiers, fraternized with them and called upon 
them to help the people to overthrow the hated tsarist autocracy. 
The practical work of the Bolshevik Party at that time was directed

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 176 
by the Bureau of the Central Committee of our Party which had its 
quarters in Petrograd and was headed by Comrade Molotov. On February 
26 (March 11) the Bureau of the Central Committee issued a 
manifesto calling for the continuation of the armed struggle against 
tsardom and the formation of a Provisional Revolutionary Government. 
On February 27 (March 12) the troops in Petrograd refused to 
fire on the workers and began to line up with the people in revolt. The 
number of soldiers who had joined the revolt by the morning of February 
27 was still no more than 10,000, but by the evening it already exceeded 
60,000. 
The workers and soldiers who had risen in revolt began to arrest 
tsarist ministers and generals and to free revolutionaries from jail. The 
released political prisoners joined the revolutionary struggle. 
In the streets, shots were still being exchanged with police and gendarmes 
posted with machine guns in the attics of houses. But the troops 
rapidly went over to the side of the workers, and this decided the fate 
of the tsarist autocracy. 
When the news of the victory of the revolution in Petrograd spread 
to other towns and to the front, the workers and soldiers everywhere 
began to depose the tsarist officials. 
The February bourgeois-democratic revolution had won. 
The revolution was victorious because its vanguard was the working 
class which headed the movement of millions of peasants clad in soldiers¹ 
uniform demanding ³peace, bread and liberty.² It was the hegemony 
of the proletariat that determined the success of the revolution. 
³The revolution was made by the proletariat. The proletariat 
displayed heroism; it shed its blood; it swept along with it the broadest 
masses of the toiling and poor population,² wrote Lenin in the 
early days of the revolution. (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., 
Vol. XX, pp. 23-4.) 
The First Revolution, that of 1905, had prepared the way for the 
swift success of the Second Revolution, that of 1917. 
³Without the tremendous class battles,² Lenin wrote, ³and 
the revolutionary energy displayed by the Russian proletariat during 
the three years, 1905-07, the second revolution could not possibly 
have been so rapid in the sense that its initial stage was completed 
in a few days.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. VI, pp. 3-4.) 
Soviets arose in the very first days of the revolution. The victorious 
revolution rested on the support of the Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ 
Deputies. The workers and soldiers who rose in revolt created Soviets

177 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies. The Revolution of 1905 had shown 
that the Soviets were organs of armed uprising and at the same time the 
embryo of a new, revolutionary power. The idea of Soviets lived in the 
minds of the working-class masses, and they put it into effect as soon 
as tsardom was overthrown, with this difference, however, that in 1905 
it was Soviets only of Workers¹ Deputies that were formed, whereas in 
February 1917, on the initiative of the Bolsheviks, there arose Soviets 
of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies. 
While the Bolsheviks were directly leading the struggle of the masses 
in the streets, the compromising parties, the Mensheviks and Socialist- 
Revolutionaries, were seizing the seats in the Soviets, and building up a 
majority there. This was partly facilitated by the fact that the majority 
of the leaders of the Bolshevik Party were in prison or exile (Lenin was 
in exile abroad and Stalin and Sverdlov in banishment in Siberia) while 
the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries were freely promenading 
the streets of Petrograd. The result was that the Petrograd Soviet and 
its Executive Committee were headed by representatives of the compromising 
parties: Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. This was also 
the case in Moscow and a number of other cities. Only in Ivanovo- 
Voznesensk, Krasnoyarsk and a few other places did the Bolsheviks have 
a majority in the Soviets from the very outset. 
The armed peoplethe workers and soldierssent their representatives 
to the Soviet as to an organ of power of the people. They thought 
and believed that the Soviet of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies would 
carry out all the demands of the revolutionary people, and that, in the 
first place, peace would be concluded. 
But the unwarranted trustfulness of the workers and soldiers served 
them in evil stead. The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks had 
not the slightest intention of terminating the war, of securing peace. 
They planned to take advantage of the revolution to continue the war. 
As to the revolution and the revolutionary demands of the people, the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks considered that the revolution 
was already over, and that the task now was to seal it and to pass 
to a ³normal² constitutional existence side by side with the bourgeoisie. 
The Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders of the Petrograd 
Soviet therefore did their utmost to shelve the question of terminating 
the war, to shelve the question of peace, and to hand over the power to 
the bourgeoisie. 
On February 27 (March 12), 1917, the liberal members of the 
Fourth State Duma, as the result of a backstairs agreement with the 
Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders, set up a Provisional

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 178 
Committee of the State Duma, headed by Rodzyanko, the President of 
the Duma, a landlord and a monarchist. And a few days later, the 
Provisional Committee of the State Duma and the Socialist-Revolutionary 
and Menshevik leaders of the Executive Committee of the Soviet of 
Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies, acting secretly from the Bolsheviks, 
came to an agreement to form a new government of Russiaa bourgeois 
Provisional Government, headed by Prince Lvov, the man whom, 
prior to the February Revolution, even Tsar Nicholas II was about to 
make the Prime Minister of his government. The Provisional Government 
included Milyukov, the head of the Constitutional-Democrats, 
Guchkov, the head of the Octobrists, and other prominent representatives 
of the capitalist class, and, as the representative of the ³democracy,² 
the Socialist-Revolutionary Kerensky. 
And so it was that the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders 
of the Executive Committee of the Soviet surrendered the power to the 
bourgeoisie. Yet when the Soviet of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies 
learned of this, its majority formally approved of the action of the 
Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders, despite the protest of 
the Bolsheviks. 
Thus a new state power arose in Russia, consisting, as Lenin said, of representatives 
of the ³bourgeoisie and landlords who had become bourgeois.² 
But alongside of the bourgeois government there existed another 
powerthe Soviet of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies. The soldier 
deputies on the Soviet were mostly peasants who had been mobilized 
for the war. The Soviet of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies was an 
organ of the alliance of workers and peasants against the tsarist regime, 
and at the same time it was an organ of their power, an organ of the 
dictatorship of the working class and the peasantry. 
The result was a peculiar interlocking of two powers, of two dictatorships: 
the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, represented by the Provisional 
Government, and the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, 
represented by the Soviet of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies. 
The result was a dual power. 
How is it to be explained that the majority in the Soviets at first 
consisted of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries? 
How is it to be explained that the victorious workers and peasants voluntarily 
surrendered the power to the representatives of the bourgeoisie? 
Lenin explained it by pointing out that millions of people, inexperienced 
in politics, had awakened and pressed forward to political 
activity. These were for the most part small owners, peasants, workers 
who had recently been peasants, people who stood midway between the

179 1 9 1 4 - 1 9 1 7 
bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Russia was at that time the most pettybourgeois 
of all the big European countries. And in this country, ³a 
gigantic petty-bourgeois wave has swept over everything and overwhelmed 
the class-conscious proletariat, not only by force of numbers 
but also ideologically; that is, it has infected and imbued very wide 
circles of workers with the petty-bourgeois political outlook.² (Lenin, 
Selected Works, Vol. VI, p. 49.) 
It was this elemental petty-bourgeois wave that swept the pettybourgeois 
Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties to the fore. 
Lenin pointed out that another reason was the change in the composition 
of the proletariat that had taken place during the war and the 
inadequate class-consciousness and organization of the proletariat at the 
beginning of the revolution. During the war big changes had taken 
place in the proletariat itself. About 40 per cent of the regular workers 
had been drafted into the army. Many small owners, artisans and shopkeepers, 
to whom the proletarian psychology was alien, had gone to the 
factories in order to evade mobilization. 
It was these petty-bourgeois sections of the workers that formed the 
soil which nourished the petty-bourgeois politiciansthe Mensheviks and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
That is why large numbers of the people, inexperienced in politics, 
swept into the elemental petty-bourgeois vortex, and intoxicated with 
the first successes of the revolution, found themselves in its early months 
under the sway of the compromising parties and consented to surrender 
the state power to the bourgeoisie in the naive belief that a bourgeois 
power would not hinder the Soviets in their work. 
The task that confronted the Bolshevik Party was, by patient 
work of explanation, to open the eyes of the masses to the imperialist 
character of the Provisional Government, to expose the treachery of the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks and to show that peace could 
not be secured unless the Provisional Government were replaced by a 
government of Soviets. 
And to this work the Bolshevik Party addressed itself with the 
utmost energy. 
It resumed the publication of its legal periodicals. The newspaper 
Pravda appeared in Petrograd five days after the February Revolution, 
and the Sotsial-Demokrat in Moscow a few days later. The Party was 
assuming leadership of the masses, who were losing their confidence in 
the liberal bourgeoisie and in the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
It patiently explained to the soldiers and peasants the necessity of 
acting jointly with the working class. It explained to them that the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 180 
peasants would secure neither peace nor land unless the revolution were 
further developed and the bourgeois Provisional Government replaced 
by a government of Soviets. 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
The imperialist war arose owing to the uneven development of the 
capitalist countries, to the upsetting of equilibrium between the principal 
powers, to the imperialists¹ need for a redivision of the world by means 
of war and for the creation of a new equilibrium. 
The war would not have been so destructive, and perhaps would 
not even have assumed such dimensions, if the parties of the Second 
International had not betrayed the cause of the working class, if they had 
not violated the anti-war decisions of the congresses of the Second International, 
if they had dared to act and to rouse the working class against 
their imperialist governments, against the warmongers. 
The Bolshevik Party was the only proletarian party which remained 
faithful to the cause of Socialism and internationalism and which organized 
civil war against its own imperialist government. All the other 
parties of the Second International, being tied to the bourgeoisie through 
their leaders, found themselves under the sway of imperialism and deserted 
to the side of the imperialists. 
The war, while it was a reflection of the general crisis of capitalism, 
at the same time aggravated this crisis and weakened world capitalism. 
The workers of Russia and the Bolshevik Party were the first in the 
world successfully to take advantage of the weakness of capitalism. They 
forced a breach in the imperialist front, overthrew the tsar and set up 
Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies. 
Intoxicated by the first successes of the revolution, and lulled by the 
assurances of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries that from now 
on everything would go well, the bulk of the petty-bourgeoisie, the 
soldiers, as well as the workers, placed their confidence in the Provisional 
Government and supported it. 
The Bolshevik Party was confronted with the task of explaining to 
the masses of workers and soldiers, who had been intoxicated by the first 
successes, that the complete victory of the revolution was still a long way 
off, that as long as the power was in the hands of the bourgeois Provisional 
Government, and as long as the Soviets were dominated by the 
compromisersthe Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionariesthe people 
would secure neither peace, nor land, nor bread, and that in order to 
achieve complete victory, one more step had to be taken and the power 
transferred to the Soviets.

OPEN POLITICAL WORK. LENIN ARRIVES IN PETROGRAD. 
LENIN¹S APRIL THESES. PARTY¹S POLICY OF TRANSITION TO 
SOCIALIST REVOLUTION 
The course of events and the conduct of the Provisional Government 
daily furnished new proofs of the correctness of the Bolshevik line. It 
became increasingly evident that the Provisional Government stood not 
for the people but against the people, not for peace but for war, and that 
it was unwilling and unable to give the people peace, land or bread. The 
explanatory work of the Bolsheviks found a fruitful soil. 
While the workers and soldiers were overthrowing the tsarist government 
and destroying the monarchy root and branch, the Provisional 
Government definitely wanted to preserve the monarchy. On March 2, 
1917, it secretly commissioned Guchkov and Shulgin to go and see the 
tsar. The bourgeoisie wanted to transfer the power to Nicholas Romanov¹s 
brother, Michael. But when, at a meeting of railwaymen, Guchkov 
ended his speech with the words, ³Long live Emperor Michael,² 
the workers demanded that Guchkov be immediately arrested and 
searched. ³Horse-radish is no sweeter than radish,² they exclaimed indignantly. 
It was clear that the workers would not permit the restoration of 
the monarchy. 
While the workers and peasants who were shedding their blood 
making the revolution expected that the war would be terminated, while 
they were fighting for bread and land and demanding vigorous measures 
to end the economic chaos, the Provisional Government remained 
deaf to these vital demands of the people. Consisting as it did of prominent 
representatives of the capitalists and landlords, this government had 
no intention of satisfying the demand of the peasants that the land be 
181

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 182 
turned over to them. Nor could they provide bread for the working 
people, because to do so they would have to encroach on the interests of 
the big grain dealers and to take grain from the landlords and the kulaks 
by every available means; and this the government did not dare to do, 
for it was itself tied up with the interests of these classes. Nor could it 
give the people peace. Bound as it was to the British and French imperialists, 
the Provisional Government had no intention of terminating the 
war; on the contrary, it endeavoured to take advantage of the revolution 
to make Russia¹s participation in the imperialist war even more active, 
and to realize its imperialist designs of seizing Constantinople, the Straits 
and Galicia. 
It was clear that the people¹s confidence in the policy of the Provisional 
Government must soon come to an end. 
It was becoming clear that the dual power which had arisen after 
the February Revolution could not last long, for the course of events 
demanded the concentration of power in the hands of one authority: 
either the Provisional Government or the Soviets. 
It was true that the compromising policy of the Mensheviks and the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries still met with support among the masses. There 
were quite a number of workers, and an even larger number of soldiers 
and peasants, who still believed that ³the Constituent Assembly will soon 
come and arrange everything in a peaceful way,² and who thought that 
the war was not waged for purposes of conquest, but from necessity 
to defend the state. Lenin called such people honestly-mistaken supporters 
of the war. These people still considered the Socialist-Revolutionary 
and Menshevik policy, which was one of promises and coaxing, the 
correct policy. But it was clear that promises and coaxing could not 
suffice for long, as the course of events and the conduct of the Provisional 
Government were daily revealing and proving that the compromising 
policy of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks was a 
policy of procrastination and of hoodwinking the credulous. 
The Provisional Government did not always confine itself to a covert 
struggle against the revolutionary movement of the masses, to backstairs 
scheming against the revolution. It sometimes attempted to make an 
open assault on the democratic liberties, to ³restore discipline,² especially 
among the soldiers, to ³establish order,² that is, to direct the revolution 
into channels that suited the needs of the bourgeoisie. But all its efforts 
in this direction failed, and the people eagerly exercised their democratic 
liberties, namely, freedom of speech, press, association, assembly and demonstration. 
The workers and soldiers endeavoured to make full use of 
their newly-won democratic rights in order to take an active part in the

183 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
political life of the country, to get an intelligent understanding of the 
situation and to decide what was to be done next. 
After the February Revolution, the organizations of the Bolshevik 
Party, which had worked illegally under the extremely difficult conditions 
of tsardom, emerged from underground and began to develop 
political and organizational work openly. The membership of the Bolshevik 
organizations at that time did not exceed 40,000 or 45,000. But 
these were all staunch revolutionaries, steeled in the struggle. The Party 
Committees were reorganized on the principle of democratic centralism. 
All Party bodies, from top to bottom, were made elective. 
When the Party began its legal existence, differences within its 
ranks became apparent. Kamenev and several workers of the Moscow 
organization, for example, Rykov, Bubnov and Nogin, held a semi- 
Menshevik position of conditionally supporting the Provisional Government 
and the policy of the partisans of the war. Stalin, who had 
just returned from exile, Molotov and others, together with the majority 
of the Party, upheld a policy of no-confidence in the Provisional Government, 
opposed the partisans of the war, and called for an active struggle 
for peace, a struggle against the imperialist war. Some of the Party 
workers vacillated, which was a manifestation of their political backwardness, 
a consequence of long years of imprisonment or exile. 
The absence of the leader of the Party, Lenin, was felt. 
On April 3 (16), 1917, after a long period of exile, Lenin returned 
to Russia. 
Lenin¹s arrival was of tremendous importance to the Party and the 
revolution. 
While still in Switzerland, Lenin, upon receiving the first news of 
the revolution, had written his ³Letters From Afar² to the Party and 
to the working class of Russia, in which he said: 
³Workers, you have displayed marvels of proletarian heroism, 
the heroism of the people, in the civil war against tsardom. You 
must now display marvels of organization, organization of the proletariat 
and of the whole people, in order to prepare the way for 
your victory in the second stage of the revolution.² (Lenin, Selected 
Works, Vol. VI, p. 11.) 
Lenin arrived in Petrograd on the night of April 3. Thousands of 
workers, soldiers and sailors assembled at the Finland Railway Station 
and in the station square to welcome him. Their enthusiasm as Lenin 
alighted from the train was indescribable. They lifted their leader shoulder 
high and carried him to the main waiting room of the station. There

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 184 
the Mensheviks Chkheidze and Skobelev launched into speeches of ³welcome² 
on behalf of the Petrograd Soviet, in which they ³expressed the 
hope² that they and Lenin would find a ³common language.² But 
Lenin did not stop to listen; sweeping past them, he went out to the 
masses of workers and soldiers. Mounting an armoured car, he delivered 
his famous speech in which he called upon the masses to fight for the 
victory of the Socialist revolution. ³Long live the Socialist revolution!² 
were the words with which Lenin concluded this first speech after long 
years of exile. 
Back in Russia, Lenin flung himself vigorously into revolutionary 
work. On the morrow of his arrival he delivered a report on the subject 
of the war and the revolution at a meeting of Bolsheviks, and then repeated 
the theses of this report at a meeting attended by Mensheviks as 
well as Bolsheviks. 
These were Lenin¹s famous April Theses, which provided the Party 
and the proletariat with a clear revolutionary line for the transition from 
the bourgeois to the Socialist revolution. 
Lenin¹s theses were of immense significance to the revolution and to 
the subsequent work of the Party. The revolution was a momentous 
turn in the life of the country. In the new conditions of the struggle 
that followed the overthrow of tsardom, the Party needed a new orientation 
to advance boldly and confidently along the new road. Lenin¹s 
theses gave the Party this orientation. 
Lenin¹s April Theses laid down for the Party a brilliant plan of struggle 
for the transition from the bourgeois-democratic to the Socialist revolution, 
from the first stage of the revolution to the second stagethe 
stage of the Socialist revolution. The whole history of the Party had 
prepared it for this great task. As far back as 1905, Lenin had said in 
his pamphlet, Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution, 
that after the overthrow of tsardom the proletariat would proceed 
to bring about the Socialist revolution. The new thing in the theses 
was that they gave a concrete, theoretically grounded plan for the initial 
stage of the transition to the Socialist revolution. 
The transitional steps in the economic field were: nationalization of 
all the land and confiscation of the landed estates, amalgamation of all 
the banks into one national bank to be under the control of the Soviet 
of Workers¹ Deputies, and establishment of control over the social production 
and distribution of products. 
In the political field, Lenin proposed the transition from a parliamentary 
republic to a republic of Soviets. This was an important step 
forward in the theory and practice of Marxism. Hitherto, Marxist theo

185 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
reticians had regarded the parliamentary republic as the best political 
form of transition to Socialism. Now Lenin proposed to replace the 
parliamentary republic by a Soviet republic as the most suitable form of 
political organization of society in the period of transition from capitalism 
to Socialism. 
³The specific feature of the present situation in Russia,² the 
theses stated, ³is that it represents a transition from the first stage of 
the revolutionwhich, owing to the insufficient class-consciousness 
and organization of the proletariat, placed the power in the hands of 
the bourgeoisieto the second stage, which must place the power 
in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest strata of the peasantry.² 
(Ibid., p. 22.) 
³Not a parliamentary republicto return to a parliamentary 
republic from the Soviets of Workers¹ Deputies would be a retrograde 
stepbut a republic of Soviets of Workers¹, Agricultural Labourers¹ 
and Peasants¹ Deputies throughout the country, from top 
to bottom.² (Ibid., p. 23.) 
Under the new government, the Provisional Government, the war 
continued to be a predatory imperialist war, Lenin said. It was the task 
of the Party to explain this to the masses and to show them that unless 
the bourgeoisie were overthrown, it would be impossible to end the war 
by a truly democratic peace and not a rapacious peace. 
As regards the Provisional Government, the slogan Lenin put forward 
was: ³No support for the Provisional Government!² 
Lenin further pointed out in the theses that our Party was still in 
the minority in the Soviets, that the Soviets were dominated by a bloc 
of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, which was an instrument 
of bourgeois influence on the proletariat. Hence, the Party¹s task consisted 
in the following: 
³It must be explained to the masses that the Soviets of Workers¹ 
Deputies are the only possible form of revolutionary government, and 
that therefore our task is, as long as this government yields to the 
influence of the bourgeoisie, to present a patient, systematic, and 
persistent explanation of the errors of their tactics, an explanation 
especially adapted to the practical needs of the masses. As long as 
we are in the minority we carry on the work of criticizing and exposing 
errors and at the same time we preach the necessity of transferring 
the entire power of state to the Soviets of Workers¹ Deputies. 
. . .² (Ibid., p. 23.)

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 186 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
This meant that Lenin was not calling for a revolt against the Provisional 
Government, which at that moment enjoyed the confidence of 
the Soviets, that he was not demanding its overthrow, but that he 
wanted, by means of explanatory and recruiting work, to win a majority 
in the Soviets, to change the policy of the Soviets, and through the 
Soviets to alter the composition and policy of the government. 
This was a line envisaging a peaceful development of the revolution. 
Lenin further demanded that the ³soiled shirt² be discarded, that 
is, that the Party no longer call itself a Social-Democratic Party. The 
parties of the Second International and the Russian Mensheviks called 
themselves Social-Democrats. This name had been tarnished and disgraced 
by the opportunists, the betrayers of Socialism. Lenin proposed 
that the Party of the Bolsheviks should be called the Communist Party, 
which was the name given by Marx and Engels to their party. This 
name was scientifically correct, for it was the ultimate aim of the Bolshevik 
Party to achieve Communism. Mankind can pass directly from 
capitalism only to Socialism, that is, to the common ownership of the 
means of production and the distribution of products according to the 
work performed by each. Lenin said that our Party looked farther 
ahead. Socialism was inevitably bound to pass gradually into Communism, 
on the banner of which is inscribed the maxim: ³From each according 
to his abilities, to each according to his needs.² 
Lastly, Lenin in his theses demanded the creation of a new International, 
the Third, Communist International, which would be free of 
opportunism and social-chauvinism. 
Lenin¹s theses called forth a frenzied outcry from the bourgeoisie, 
the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
The Mensheviks issued a proclamation to the workers which began 
with the warning: ³the revolution is in danger.² The danger, in the 
opinion of the Mensheviks, lay in the fact that the Bolsheviks had advanced 
the demand for the transfer of power to the Soviets of Workers¹ 
and Soldiers¹ Deputies. 
Plekhanov in his newspaper, Yedinstvo (Unity), wrote an article 
in which he termed Lenin¹s speech a ³raving speech.² He quoted the 
words of the Menshevik Chkheidze, who said: ³Lenin alone will remain 
outside the revolution, and we shall go our own way.² 
On April 14 a Petrograd City Conference of Bolsheviks was held. 
The conference approved Lenin¹s theses and made them the basis of 
its work. 
Within a short while the local organizations of the Party had also 
approved Lenin¹s theses.

187 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
The whole Party, with the exception of a few individuals of the 
type of Kamenev, Rykov and Pyatakov, received Lenin¹s theses with 
profound satisfaction. 
2. BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
APRIL CONFERENCE OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY 
While the Bolsheviks were preparing for the further development 
of the revolution, the Provisional Government continued to work against 
the people. On April 18, Milyukov, Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 
Provisional Government, informed the Allies that ³the whole people 
desire to continue the World War until a decisive victory is achieved 
and that the Provisional Government intends fully to observe the obligations 
undertaken towards our allies.² 
Thus the Provisional Government pledged its loyalty to the tsarist 
treaties and promised to go on shedding as much of the people¹s blood 
as the imperialists might require for a ³victorious finish.² 
On April 19 this statement (³Milyukov¹s note²) became known 
to the workers and soldiers. On April 20 the Central Committee of the 
Bolshevik Party called upon the masses to protest against the imperialist 
policy of the Provisional Government. On April 20-21 (May 3-4), 
1917, not less than 100,000 workers and soldiers, stirred to indignation 
by ³Milyukov¹s note,² took part in a demonstration. Their banners bore 
the demands: ³Publish the secret treaties!² ³Down with the war!² 
³All power to the Soviets!² The workers and soldiers marched from 
the outskirts of the city to the centre, where the Provisional Government 
was sitting. On the Nevsky Prospect and other places clashes with 
groups of bourgeois took place. 
The more outspoken counter-revolutionaries, like General Kornilov, 
demanded that fire be opened on the demonstrators, and even gave 
orders to that effect. But the troops refused to carry out the orders. 
During the demonstration, a small group of members of the Petrograd 
Party Committee (Bagdatyev and others) issued a slogan demanding 
the immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government. The 
Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party sharply condemned the conduct 
of these ³Left² adventurers, considering this slogan untimely and 
incorrect, a slogan that hampered the Party in its efforts to win over 
a majority in the Soviets and ran counter to the Party line of a peaceful 
development of the revolution. 
The events of April 20-21 signified the beginning of the crisis of the 
Provisional Government.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 188 
This was the first serious rift in the compromising policy of the 
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
On May 2, 1917, under the pressure of the masses, Milyukov and 
Guchkov were dropped from the Provisional Government. 
The first coalition Provisional Government was formed. It included, 
in addition to representatives of the bourgeoisie, Mensheviks 
(Skobelev and Tsereteli) and Socialist-Revolutionaries (Chernov, Kerensky 
and others). 
Thus the Mensheviks, who in 1905 had declared it impermissible for representatives 
of the Social-Democratic Party to take part in a revolutionary 
Provisional Government, now found it permissible for their 
representatives to take part in a counter-revolutionary Provisional Government. 
The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had thus deserted 
to the camp of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie. 
On April 24, 1917, the Seventh (April) Conference of the Bolshevik 
Party assembled. For the first time in the existence of the Party 
a Bolshevik Conference met openly. In the history of the Party this 
conference holds a place of importance equal to that of a Party Congress. 
The All-Russian April Conference showed that the Party was 
growing by leaps and bounds. The conference was attended by 133 
delegates with vote and by 18 with voice but no vote. They represented 
80,000 organized members of the Party. 
The conference discussed and laid down the Party line on all basic 
questions of the war and revolution: the current situation, the war, the 
Provisional Government, the Soviets, the agrarian question, the national 
question, etc. 
In his report, Lenin elaborated the principles he had already set 
forth in the April Theses. The task of the Party was to effect the 
transition from the first stage of the revolution, ³which placed the power 
in the hands of the bourgeoisie . . . to the second stage, which must place 
the power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest strata of the 
peasantry² (Lenin). The course the Party should take was to prepare 
for the Socialist revolution. The immediate task of the Party was set 
forth by Lenin in the slogan: ³All power to the Soviets!² 
The slogan, ³All power to the Soviets!² meant that it was necessary 
to put an end to the dual power, that is, the division of power between 
the Provisional Government and the Soviets, to transfer the whole power 
to the Soviets, and to drive the representatives of the landlords and capitalists 
out of the organs of government. 
The conference resolved that one of the most important tasks of

189 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
the Party was untiringly to explain to the masses the truth that ³the 
Provisional Government is by its nature an organ of the rule of the 
landlords and the bourgeoisie,² as well as to show how fatal was the 
compromising policy of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks 
who were deceiving the people with false promises and subjecting them 
to the blows of the imperialist war and counter-revolution. 
Kamenev and Rykov opposed Lenin at the Conference. Echoing 
the Mensheviks, they asserted that Russia was not ripe for a Socialist 
revolution, and that only a bourgeois republic was possible in Russia. 
They recommended the Party and the working class to confine themselves 
to ³controlling² the Provisional Government. In reality, they, 
like the Mensheviks, stood for the preservation of capitalism and of the 
power of the bourgeoisie. 
Zinoviev, too, opposed Lenin at the conference; it was on the question 
whether the Bolshevik Party should remain within the Zimmerwald 
alliance, or break with it and form a new International. As the years 
of war had shown, while this alliance carried on propaganda for peace, 
it did not actually break with the bourgeois partisans of the war. Lenin 
therefore insisted on immediate withdrawal from this alliance and on the 
formation of a new, Communist International. Zinoviev proposed that 
the Party should remain within the Zimmerwald alliance. Lenin vigorously 
condemned Zinoviev¹s proposal and called his tactics ³archopportunist 
and pernicious.² 
The April Conference also discussed the agrarian and national questions. 
In connection with Lenin¹s report on the agrarian question, the 
conference adopted a resolution calling for the confiscation of the landed 
estates, which were to be placed at the disposal of the peasant committees, 
and for the nationalization of all the land. The Bolsheviks called 
upon the peasants to fight for the land, showing them that the Bolshevik 
Party was the only revolutionary party, the only party that was really 
helping the peasants to overthrow the landlords. 
Of great importance was Comrade Stalin¹s report on the national 
question. Even before the revolution, on the eve of the imperialist war, 
Lenin and Stalin had elaborated the fundamental principles of the policy 
of the Bolshevik Party on the national question. Lenin and Stalin declared 
that the proletarian party must support the national liberation 
movement of the oppressed peoples against imperialism. Consequently, 
the Bolshevik Party advocated the right of nations to self-determination 
even to the point of secession and formation of independent states. This

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 190 
was the view defended by Comrade Stalin, in his report delivered at the 
conference on behalf of the Central Committee. 
Lenin and Stalin were opposed by Pyatakov, who, together with 
Bukharin, had already during the war taken up a national-chauvinist 
stand on the national question. Pyatakov and Bukharin were opposed 
to the right of nations to self-determination. 
The resolute and consistent position of the Party on the national 
question, its struggle for the complete equality of nations and for the 
abolition of all forms of national oppression and national inequality, secured 
for the Party the sympathy and support of the oppressed nationalities. 
The text of the resolution on the national question adopted by the 
April Conference is as follows: 
³The policy of national oppression, inherited from the autocracy 
and monarchy, is supported by the landlords, capitalists and petty 
bourgeoisie in order to protect their class privileges and to cause disunity 
among the workers of the various nationalities. Modern imperialism, 
which increases the striving to subjugate weak nations, 
is a new factor intensifying national oppression. 
³To the extent that the elimination of national oppression is 
achievable at all in capitalist society, it is possible only under a consistently 
democratic republican system and state administration that 
guarantee complete equality for all nations and languages. 
³The right of all the nations forming part of Russia freely to 
secede and form independent states must be recognized. To deny 
them this right, or to fail to take measures guaranteeing its practical 
realization, is equivalent to supporting a policy of seizure and annexation. 
It is only the recognition by the proletariat of the right of 
nations to secede that can ensure complete solidarity among the 
workers of the various nations and help to bring the nations closer 
together on truly democratic lines. . . . 
³The right of nations freely to secede must not be confused with 
the expediency of secession of a given nation at a given moment. 
The party of the proletariat must decide the latter question quite 
independently in each particular case from the standpoint of the interests 
of the social development as a whole and of the interests of 
the class struggle of the proletariat for Socialism. 
³The Party demands broad regional autonomy, the abolition of 
supervision from above, the abolition of a compulsory state language 
and the determination of the boundaries of the self-governing and 
autonomous regions by the local population itself in accordance with

191 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
the economic and social conditions, the national composition of the 
population, and so forth. 
³The party of the proletariat resolutely rejects what is known 
as national cultural autonomy,¹ under which education, etc., is removed 
from the competence of the state and placed within the competence 
of some kind of national Diets. National cultural autonomy 
artificially divides the workers living in one locality, and even 
working in the same industrial enterprise, according to their various 
national cultures¹; in other words it strengthens the ties between the 
workers and the bourgeois culture of individual nations, whereas the 
aim of the Social-Democrats is to develop the international culture of 
the world proletariat. 
³The Party demands that a fundamental law shall be embodied 
in the constitution annulling all privileges enjoyed by any nation 
whatever and all infringements of the rights of national minorities. 
³The interests of the working class demand that the workers of 
all the nationalities of Russia should have common proletarian organizations: 
political, trade union, educational institutions of the co-operatives 
and so forth. Only such common organizations of the workers 
of the various nationalities will make it possible for the proletariat 
to wage a successful struggle against international capital and bourgeois 
nationalism.² (Lenin and Stalin, The Russian Revolution, pp. 
52-3.) 
Thus the April Conference exposed the opportunist, anti-Leninist 
stand of Kamenev, Zinoviev, Pyatakov, Bukharin, Rykov and their small 
following. 
The conference unanimously supported Lenin by taking up a precise 
stand on all important questions and adopting a course leading to the 
victory of the Socialist revolution. 
3. SUCCESSES OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY IN THE CAPITAL. ABORTIVE 
OFFENSIVE OF THE ARMIES OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
SUPPRESSION OF THE JULY DEMONSTRATION OF 
WORKERS AND SOLDIERS 
On the basis of the decisions of the April Conference, the Party 
developed extensive activities in order to win over the masses, and to 
train and organize them for battle. The Party line in that period was, 
by patiently explaining the Bolshevik policy and exposing the compromising 
policy of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, to isolate 
these parties from the masses and to win a majority in the Soviets.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 192 
In addition to the work in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks carried on 
extensive activities in the trade unions and in the factory committees. 
Particularly extensive was the work of the Bolsheviks in the army. 
Military organizations began to arise everywhere. The Bolsheviks 
worked indefatigably at the front and in the rear to organize the soldiers 
and sailors. A particularly important part in making the soldiers active 
revolutionaries was played at the front by the Bolshevik newspaper, 
Okopnaya Pravda (Trench Truth). 
Thanks to Bolshevik propaganda and agitation, already in the early 
months of the revolution the workers in many cities held new elections 
to the Soviets, especially to the district Soviets, drove out the Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries and elected followers of the Bolshevik 
Party in their stead. 
The work of the Bolsheviks yielded splendid results, especially in 
Petrograd. 
A Petrograd Conference of Factory Committees was held from 
May 30 to June 3, 1917. At this conference three-quarters of the 
delegates already supported the Bolsheviks. Almost the entire Petrograd 
proletariat supported the Bolshevik slogan³All power to the Soviets!² 
On June 3 (16), 1917, the First All-Russian Congress of Soviets 
met. The Bolsheviks were still in the minority in the Soviets; they had 
a little over 100 delegates at this congress, compared with 700 or 800 
Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and others. 
At the First Congress of Soviets, the Bolsheviks insistently stressed 
the fatal consequences of compromise with the bourgeoisie and exposed 
the imperialist character of the war. Lenin made a speech at the congress 
in which he showed the correctness of the Bolshevik line and declared 
that only a government of Soviets could give bread to the working people, 
land to the peasants, secure peace and lead the country out of chaos. 
A mass campaign was being conducted at that time in the workingclass 
districts of Petrograd for the organization of a demonstration and 
for the presentation of demands to the Congress of Soviets. In its anxiety 
to prevent the workers from demonstrating without its authorization, 
and in the hope of utilizing the revolutionary sentiments of the masses 
for its own ends, the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet 
decided to call a demonstration for June 18 (July 1). The Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries expected that it would take place under 
anti-Bolshevik slogans. The Bolshevik Party began energetic preparations 
for this demonstration. Comrade Stalin wrote in Pravda that ³. . . it 
is our task to make sure that the demonstration in Petrograd on June 18 
takes place under our revolutionary slogans.²

193 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
The demonstration of June 18, 1917, was held at the graves of the 
martyrs of the revolution. It proved to be a veritable review of the 
forces of the Bolshevik Party. It revealed the growing revolutionary 
spirit of the masses and their growing confidence in the Bolshevik Party. 
The slogans displayed by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
calling for confidence in the Provisional Government and urging the 
continuation of the war were lost in a sea of Bolshevik slogans. Four 
hundred thousand demonstrators carried banners bearing the slogans: 
³Down with the war!² ³Down with the ten capitalist Ministers!² ³All 
power to the Soviets!² 
It was a complete fiasco for the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
a fiasco for the Provisional Government in the capital of the 
country. 
Nevertheless, the Provisional Government received the support of 
the First Congress of the Soviets and decided to continue the imperialist 
policy. On that very day, June 18, the Provisional Government, in 
obedience to the wishes of the British and French imperialists, drove the 
soldiers at the front to take the offensive. The bourgeoisie regarded this 
as the only means of putting an end to the revolution. In the event of 
the success of the offensive, the bourgeoisie hoped to take the whole 
power into its own hands, to push the Soviets out of the arena, and to 
crush the Bolsheviks. Again, in the event of its failure, the entire blame 
could be thrown upon the Bolsheviks by accusing them of disintegrating 
the army. 
There could be no doubt that the offensive would fail. And fail it 
did. The soldiers were worn out, they did not understand the purpose 
of the offensive, they had no confidence in their officers who were alien 
to them, there was a shortage of artillery and shells. All this made the 
failure of the offensive a foregone conclusion. 
The news of the offensive at the front, and then of its collapse, 
roused the capital. The indignation of the workers and soldiers knew 
no bounds. It became apparent that when the Provisional Government 
proclaimed a policy of peace it was hoodwinking the people, and that it 
wanted to continue the imperialist war. It became apparent that the 
All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets and the Petrograd 
Soviet were unwilling or unable to check the criminal deeds of the 
Provisional Government and themselves trailed in its wake. 
The revolutionary indignation of the Petrograd workers and soldiers 
boiled over. On July 3 (16) spontaneous demonstrations started in the 
Vyborg District of Petrograd. They continued all day. The separate 
demonstrations grew into a huge general armed demonstration demand

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 194 
ing the transfer of power to the Soviets. The Bolshevik Party was opposed 
to armed action at that time, for it considered that the revolutionary 
crisis had not yet matured, that the army and the provinces were not yet 
prepared to support an uprising in the capital, and that an isolated and 
premature rising might only make it easier for the counter-revolutionaries 
to crush the vanguard of the revolution. But when it became 
obviously impossible to keep the masses from demonstrating, the Party 
resolved to participate in the demonstration in order to lend it a peaceful 
and organized character. This the Bolshevik Party succeeded in 
doing. Hundreds of thousands of men and women marched to the 
headquarters of the Petrograd Soviet and the All-Russian Central Executive 
Committee of Soviets, where they demanded that the Soviets take 
the power into their own hands, break with the imperialist bourgeoisie, 
and pursue an active peace policy. 
Notwithstanding the pacific character of the demonstration, reactionary 
unitsdetachments of officers and cadets were brought out against 
it. The streets of Petrograd ran with the blood of workers and soldiers. 
The most ignorant and counter-revolutionary units of the army were 
summoned from the front to suppress the workers. 
After suppressing the demonstration of workers and soldiers, the 
Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, in alliance with the bourgeoisie 
and Whiteguard generals, fell upon the Bolshevik Party. The Pravda 
premises were wrecked. Pravda, Soldatskaya Pravda (Soldiers¹ Truth) 
and a number of other Bolshevik newspapers were suppressed. A worker 
named Voinov was killed by cadets in the street merely for selling Listok 
Pravdy (Pravda Bulletin). Disarming of the Red Guards began. 
Revolutionary units of the Petrograd garrison were withdrawn from 
the capital and dispatched to the trenches. Arrests were carried out in 
the rear and at the front. On July 7 a warrant was issued for Lenin¹s 
arrest. A number of prominent members of the Bolshevik Party were 
arrested. The Trud printing plant, where the Bolshevik publications were 
printed, was wrecked. The Procurator of the Petrograd Court of Sessions 
announced that Lenin and a number of other Bolsheviks were being 
charged with ³high treason² and the organization of an armed uprising. 
The charge against Lenin was fabricated at the headquarters of General 
Denikin, and was based on the testimony of spies and agents-provocateurs. 
Thus the coalition Provisional Governmentwhich included such 
leading representatives of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
as Tsereteli, Skobelev, Kerensky and Chernovsank to the depths of 
downright imperialism and counter-revolution. Instead of a policy of

195 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
peace, it had adopted the policy of continuing war. Instead of protecting 
the democratic rights of the people, it had adopted the policy of nullifying 
these rights and suppressing the workers and soldiers by force of 
arms. 
What Guchkov and Milyukov, the representatives of the bourgeoisie, 
had hesitated to do, was done by the ³socialists² Kerensky and Tsereteli, 
Chernov and Skobelev. 
The dual power had come to an end. 
It ended in favour of the bourgeoisie, for the whole power had passed 
into the hands of the Provisional Government, while the Soviets, with 
their Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik leaders, had become an appendage 
of the Provisional Government. 
The peaceful period of the revolution had ended, for now the bayonet 
had been placed on the agenda. 
In view of the changed situation, the Bolshevik Party decided to 
change its tactics. It went underground, arranged for a safe hiding place 
for its leader, Lenin, and began to prepare for an uprising with the object 
of overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie by force of arms and 
setting up the power of the Soviets. 
4. THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY ADOPTS THE COURSE OF PREPARING 
FOR ARMED UPRISING. SIXTH PARTY CONGRESS 
The Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party met in Petrograd in 
the midst of a frenzied campaign of Bolshevik-baiting in the bourgeois 
and petty-bourgeois press. It assembled ten years after the Fifth (London) 
Congress and five years after the Prague Conference of the Bolsheviks. 
The congress, which was held secretly, sat from July 26 to 
August 3, 1917. All that appeared in the press was an announcement 
of its convocation, the place of meeting was not divulged. The first 
sittings were held in the Vyborg District, the later ones in a school near 
the Narva Gate, where a House of Culture now stands. The bourgeois 
press demanded the arrest of the delegates. Detectives frantically scoured 
the city trying to discover the meeting place of the congress, but in vain. 
And so, five months after the overthrow of tsardom, the Bolsheviks 
were compelled to meet in secret, while Lenin, the leader of the proletarian 
party, was forced to go into hiding and took refuge in a shanty 
near Razliv Station. 
He was being hunted high and low by the sleuths of the Provisional 
Government and was therefore unable to attend the congress; but he

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 196 
guided its labours from his place of concealment through his close colleagues 
and disciples in Petrograd: Stalin, Sverdlov, Molotov, Ordjonikidze. 
The congress was attended by 157 delegates with vote and 128 with 
voice but no vote. At that time the Party had a membership of about 
240,000. On July 3, i.e., before the workers¹ demonstration was broken 
up, when the Bolsheviks were still functioning legally, the Party had 41 
publications, of which 29 were in Russian and 12 in other languages. 
The persecution to which the Bolsheviks and the working class were 
subjected during the July days, far from diminishing the influence of 
our Party, only enhanced it. The delegates from the provinces cited 
numerous facts to show that the workers and soldiers had begun to desert 
the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries en masse, contemptuously 
styling them ³social-jailers.² Workers and soldiers belonging to the 
Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties were tearing up their 
membership cards in anger and disgust and applying for admission to 
the Bolshevik Party. 
The chief items discussed at the congress were the political report 
of the Central Committee and the political situation. Comrade Stalin 
made the reports on both these questions. He showed with the utmost 
clarity how the revolution was growing and developing despite all the 
efforts of the bourgeoisie to suppress it. He pointed out that the revolution 
had placed on the order of the day the task of establishing workers¹ 
control over the production and distribution of products, of turning 
over the land to the peasants, and of transferring the power from the 
bourgeoisie to the working class and poor peasantry. He said that the 
revolution was assuming the character of a Socialist revolution. 
The political situation in the country had changed radically after the 
July days. The dual power had come to an end. The Soviets, led by 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, had refused to take over full 
power and had therefore lost all power. The power was now concentrated 
in the hands of the bourgeois Provisional Government, and the 
latter was continuing to disarm the revolution, to smash its organizations 
and to destroy the Bolshevik Party. All possibility of a peaceful development 
of the revolution had vanished. Only one thing remained, Comrade 
Stalin said, namely, to take power by force, by overthrowing the Provisional 
Government. And only the proletariat, in alliance with the poor 
peasants, could take power by force. 
The Soviets, still controlled by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
had landed in the camp of the bourgeoisie, and under existing 
conditions could be expected to act only as subsidiaries of the Provisional

197 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
Government. Now, after the July days, Comrade Stalin said, the slogan 
³All power to the Soviets!² had to be withdrawn. However, the temporary 
withdrawal of this slogan did not in any way imply a renunciation 
of the struggle for the power of the Soviets. It was not the Soviets in 
general, as organs of revolutionary struggle, that were in question, but 
only the existing Soviets, the Soviets controlled by the Mensheviks and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
³The peaceful period of the revolution has ended,² said Comrade 
Stalin, ³a non-peaceful period has begun, a period of clashes and 
explosions.² (Lenin and Stalin, Russian Revolution, pp. 139-140.) 
The Party was headed for armed uprising. 
There were some at the congress who, reflecting the bourgeois influence, 
opposed the adoption of the course of Socialist revolution. 
The Trotskyite Preobrazhensky proposed that the resolution on the 
conquest of power should state that the country could be directed towards 
Socialism only in the event of a proletarian revolution in the West. 
This Trotskyite motion was opposed by Comrade Stalin. He said: 
³The possibility is not excluded that Russia will be the country 
that will lay the road to Socialism. . . . We must discard the antiquated 
idea that only Europe can show us the way. There is dogmatic 
Marxism and creative Marxism. I stand by the latter.² (p. 146.) 
Bukharin, who held a Trotskyite position, asserted that the peasants 
supported the war, that they were in a bloc with the bourgeoisie and 
would not follow the working class. 
Retorting to Bukharin, Comrade Stalin showed that there were different 
kinds of peasants: there were the rich peasants who supported the 
imperialist bourgeoisie, and there were the poor peasants who sought an 
alliance with the working class and would support it in a struggle for 
the victory of the revolution. 
The congress rejected Preobrazhensky¹s and Bukharin¹s amendments 
and approved the resolution submitted by Comrade Stalin. 
The congress discussed the economic platform of the Bolsheviks and 
approved it. Its main points were the confiscation of the landed estates 
and the nationalization of all the land, the nationalization of the banks, 
the nationalization of large-scale industry, and workers¹ control over 
production and distribution. 
The congress stressed the importance of the fight for workers¹ control 
over production, which was later to play a significant part during the 
nationalization of the large industrial enterprises.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 198 
In all its decisions, the Sixth Congress particularly stressed Lenin¹s 
principle of an alliance between the proletariat and the poor peasantry as a 
condition for the victory of the Socialist revolution. 
The congress condemned the Menshevik theory that the trade unions 
should be neutral. It pointed out that the momentous tasks confronting 
the working class of Russia could be accomplished only if the trade 
unions remained militant class organizations recognizing the political 
leadership of the Bolshevik Party. 
The congress adopted a resolution on the Youth Leagues, which at 
that time frequently sprang up spontaneously. As a result of the Party¹s 
subsequent efforts it succeeded in definitely securing the adherence of 
these young organizations which became a reserve of the Party. 
The congress discussed whether Lenin should appear for trial. Kamenev, 
Rykov, Trotsky and others had held even before the congress that 
Lenin ought to appear before the counter-revolutionary court. Comrade 
Stalin was vigorously opposed to Lenin¹s appearing for trial. This was 
also the stand of the Sixth Congress, for it considered that it would be 
a lynching, not a trial. The congress had no doubt that the bourgeoisie 
wanted only one thingthe physical destruction of Lenin as the most 
dangerous enemy of the bourgeoisie. The congress protested against 
the police persecution of the leaders of the revolutionary proletariat by 
the bourgeoisie, and sent a message of greeting to Lenin. 
The Sixth Congress adopted new Party Rules. These rules provided 
that all Party organizations shall be built on the principle of democratic 
centralism. 
This meant: 
1) That all directing bodies of the Party, from top to bottom, shall 
be elected; 
2) That Party bodies shall give periodical accounts of their activities 
to their respective Party organizations; 
3) That there shall be strict Party discipline and the subordination 
of the minority to the majority; 
4) That all decisions of higher bodies shall be absolutely binding on 
lower bodies and on all Party members. 
The Party Rules provided that admission of new members to the 
Party shall be through local Party organizations on the recommendation 
of two Party members and on the sanction of a general membership 
meeting of the local organization. 
The Sixth Congress admitted the Mezhrayontsi and their leader, 
Trotsky, into the Party. They were a small group that had existed in 
Petrograd since 1913 and consisted of Trotskyite-Mensheviks and a

199 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
number of former Bolsheviks who had split away from the Party. During 
the war, the Mezhrayonsti were a Centrist organization. They 
fought the Bolsheviks, but in many respects disagreed with the Mensheviks, 
thus occupying an intermediate, centrist, vacillating position. 
During the Sixth Party Congress the Mezhrayonsti declared that 
they were in agreement with the Bolsheviks on all points and requested 
admission to the Party. The request was granted by the congress in the 
expectation that they would in time become real Bolsheviks. Some of 
the Mezhrayonsti, Volodarsky and Uritsky, for example, actually did 
become Bolsheviks. As to Trotsky and some of his close friends, they, 
as it later became apparent, had joined not to work in the interests 
of the Party, but to disrupt and destroy it from within. 
The decisions of the Sixth Congress were all intended to prepare 
the proletariat and the poorest peasantry for an armed uprising. The 
Sixth Congress headed the Party for armed uprising, for the Socialist 
revolution. 
The congress issued a Party manifesto calling upon the workers, 
soldiers and peasants to muster their forces for decisive battles with the 
bourgeoisie. It ended with the words: 
³Prepare, then, for new battles, comrades-in-arms! Staunchly, 
manfully and calmly, without yielding to provocation, muster your 
forces and form your fighting columns! Rally under the banner of 
the Party, proletarians and soldiers! Rally under our banner, downtrodden 
of the villages!² 
5. GENERAL KORNILOV¹S PLOT AGAINST THE REVOLUTION. SUPPRESSION 
OF THE PLOT. PETROGRAD AND MOSCOW SOVIETS GO 
OVER TO THE BOLSHEVIKS 
Having seized all power, the bourgeoisie began preparations to destroy 
the now weakened Soviets and to set up an open counter-revolutionary 
dictatorship. The millionaire Ryabushinsky insolently declared that 
the way out of the situation was ³for the gaunt hand of famine, of 
destitution of the people, to seize the false friends of the peoplethe 
democratic Soviets and Committeesby the throat.² At the front, 
courts-martial wreaked savage vengeance on the soldiers, and meted 
out death sentences wholesale. On August 3, 1917, General Kornilov, 
the Commander-in-Chief, demanded the introduction of the death 
penalty behind the lines as well. 
On August 12, a Council of State, convened by the Provisional

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 200 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
Government to mobilize the forces of the bourgeoisie and the landlords, 
opened in the Grand Theatre in Moscow. The Council was attended 
chiefly by representatives of the landlords, the bourgeoisie, the generals, 
the officers and Cossacks. The Soviets were represented by Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
In protest against the convocation of the Council of State, the Bolsheviks 
on the day of its opening called a general strike in Moscow in 
which the majority of the workers took part. Simultaneously, strikes 
took place in a number of other cities. 
The Socialist-Revolutionary Kerensky threatened in a fit of boasting 
at the Council to suppress ³by iron and blood² every attempt at a revolutionary 
movement, including unauthorized attempts of the peasants to 
seize the lands of the landlords. 
The counter-revolutionary General Kornilov bluntly demanded that 
³the Committees and Soviets be abolished.² 
Bankers, merchants and manufacturers flocked to Kornilov at General 
Headquarters, promising him money and support. 
Representatives of the ³Allies,² Britain and France, also came to 
General Kornilov, demanding that action against the revolution be not 
delayed. 
General Kornilov¹s plot against the revolution was coming to a head. 
Kornilov made his preparations openly. In order to distract attention, 
the conspirators started a rumour that the Bolsheviks were preparing an 
uprising in Petrograd to take place on August 27the end of the first 
six months of the revolution. The Provisional Government, headed by 
Kerensky, furiously attacked the Bolsheviks, and intensified the terror 
against the proletarian party. At the same time, General Kornilov 
massed troops in order to move them against Petrograd, abolish the 
Soviets and set up a military dictatorship. 
Kornilov had come to a preliminary agreement with Kerensky regarding 
his counter-revolutionary action. But no sooner had Kornilov¹s action 
begun than Kerensky made an abrupt right-about-face and dissociated 
himself from his ally. Kerensky feared that the masses who would rise 
against the Kornilovites and crush them would at the same time sweep 
away Kerensky¹s bourgeois government as well, unless it at once dissociated 
itself from the Kornilov affair. 
On August 25 Kornilov moved the Third Mounted Corps under the 
command of General Krymov against Petrograd, declaring that he intended 
to ³save the fatherland.² In face of the Kornilov revolt, the 
Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party called upon the workers and 
soldiers to put up active armed resistance to the counter-revolution. The

201 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
workers hurriedly began to arm and prepared to resist. The Red Guard 
detachments grew enormously during these days. The trade unions 
mobilized their members. The revolutionary military units in Petrograd 
were also held in readiness for battle. Trenches were dug around 
Petrograd, barbed wire entanglements erected, and the railway tracks 
leading to the city were torn up. Several thousand armed sailors arrived 
from Kronstadt to defend the city. Delegates were sent to the ³Savage 
Division² which was advancing on Petrograd; when these delegates 
explained the purpose of Kornilov¹s action to the Caucasian mountaineers 
of whom the ³Savage Division² was made up, they refused to 
advance. Agitators were also dispatched to other Kornilov units. Wherever 
there was danger, Revolutionary Committees and headquarters 
were set up to fight Kornilov. 
In those days the mortally terrified Socialist-Revolutionary and 
Menshevik leaders, Kerensky among them, turned for protection to the 
Bolsheviks, for they were convinced that the Bolsheviks were the only 
effective force in the capital that was capable of routing Kornilov. 
But while mobilizing the masses to crush the Kornilov revolt, the 
Bolsheviks did not discontinue their struggle against the Kerensky government. 
They exposed the government of Kerensky, the Mensheviks 
and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, to the masses, pointing out that their 
whole policy was in effect assisting Kornilov¹s counter-revolutionary plot. 
The result of these measures was that the Kornilov revolt was 
crushed. General Krymov committed suicide. Kornilov and his fellowconspirators, 
Denikin and Lukomsky, were arrested. (Very soon, however, 
Kerensky had them released.) 
The rout of the Kornilov revolt revealed in a flash the relative 
strength of the revolution and the counter-revolution. It showed that 
the whole counter-revolutionary camp was doomed, from the generals 
and the Constitutional-Democratic Party to the Mensheviks and Socialist- 
Revolutionaries who had become entangled in the meshes of the bourgeoisie. 
It became obvious that the influence of the Mensheviks and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries among the masses had been completely undermined 
by the policy of prolonging the unbearable strain of the war, 
and by the economic chaos caused by the protracted war. 
The defeat of the Kornilov revolt further showed that the Bolshevik 
Party had grown to be the decisive force of the revolution and was capable 
of foiling any attempt at counter-revolution. Our Party was not 
yet the ruling party, but during the Kornilov days it acted as the real 
ruling power, for its instructions were unhesitatingly carried out by the 
workers and soldiers.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 202
Lastly, the rout of the Kornilov revolt showed that the seemingly 
dead Soviets actually possessed tremendous latent power of revolutionary 
resistance. There could be no doubt that it was the Soviets and their 
Revolutionary Committees that barred the way of the Kornilov troops 
and broke their strength. 
The struggle against Kornilov put new vitality into the languishing 
Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies. It freed them from the 
sway of the policy of compromise. It led them into the open road 
of revolutionary struggle, and turned them towards the Bolshevik 
Party. 
The influence of the Bolsheviks in the Soviets grew stronger than 
ever.
Their influence spread rapidly in the rural districts as well. 
The Kornilov revolt made it clear to the broad masses of the peasantry 
that if the landlords and generals succeeded in smashing the Bolsheviks 
and the Soviets, they would next attack the peasantry. The mass 
of the poor peasants therefore began to rally closer to the Bolsheviks. 
As to the middle peasants, whose vacillations had retarded the development 
of the revolution in the period from April to August 1917, after 
the rout of Kornilov they definitely began to swing towards the Bolshevik 
Party, joining forces with the poor peasants. The broad masses of the 
peasantry were coming to realize that only the Bolshevik Party could 
deliver them from the war, and that only this Party was capable of crushing 
the landlords and was prepared to turn over the land to the peasants. 
The months of September and October 1917 witnessed a tremendous 
increase in the number of seizures of landed estates by the peasants. 
Unauthorized ploughing of the fields of landlords became widespread. 
The peasants had taken the road of revolution and neither coaxing 
nor punitive expeditions could any longer halt them. 
The tide of revolution was rising. 
There ensued a period of revival of the Soviets, of a change in their 
composition, their bolshevization. Factories, mills and military units held 
new elections and sent to the Soviets representatives of the Bolshevik 
Party in place of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. On August 
31, the day following the victory over Kornilov, the Petrograd Soviet 
endorsed the Bolshevik policy. The old Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary 
Presidium of the Petrograd Soviet, headed by Chkheidze, resigned, 
thus clearing the way for the Bolsheviks. On September 5, 
the Moscow Soviet of Workers¹ Deputies went over to the Bolsheviks. 
The Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik Presidium of the Moscow 
Soviet also resigned and left the way clear for the Bolsheviks.

203 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
This meant that the chief conditions for a successful uprising were 
now ripe. 
The slogan ³All power to the Soviets!² was again on the order 
of the day. 
But it was no longer the old slogan, the slogan of transferring the 
power to Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary Soviets. This time 
it was a slogan calling for an uprising of the Soviets against the Provisional 
Government, the object being to transfer the whole power in 
the country to the Soviets now led by the Bolsheviks. 
Disintegration set in among the compromising parties. 
Under the pressure of the revolutionary peasants, a Left wing formed 
within the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, known as the ³Left² Socialist- 
Revolutionaries, who expressed their disapproval of the policy of compromise 
with the bourgeoisie. 
Among the Mensheviks, too, their appeared a group of ³Lefts,² 
the so-called ³Internationalists,² who gravitated towards the Bolsheviks. 
As to the Anarchists, a group whose influence was insignificant to 
start with, they now definitely disintegrated into minute groups, some 
of which merged with criminal elements, thieves and provocateurs, the 
dregs of society; others became expropriators ³by conviction,² robbing 
the peasants and small townfolk, and appropriating the premises and 
funds of workers¹ clubs; while others still openly went over to the camp 
of the counter-revolutionaries, and devoted themselves to feathering their 
own nests as menials of the bourgeoisie. They were all opposed to authority 
of any kind, particularly and especially to the revolutionary authority 
of the workers and peasants, for they knew that a revolutionary government 
would not allow them to rob the people and steal public 
property. 
After the rout of Kornilov, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
made one more attempt to stem the rising tide of revolution. 
With this purpose in view, on September 12, 1917, they convened an 
All-Russian Democratic Conference, consisting of representatives of the 
Socialist parties, the compromising Soviets, trade unions, Zemstvos, commercial 
and industrial circles and military units. The conference set up 
a Provisional Council of the Republic, known as the Pre-parliament. 
The compromisers hoped with the help of the Pre-parliament to halt 
the revolution and to divert the country from the path of a Soviet revolution 
to the path of bourgeois constitutional development, the path of 
bourgeois parliamentarism. But this was a hopeless attempt on the part 
of political bankrupts to turn back the wheel of revolution. It was bound 
to end in a fiasco, and end in a fiasco it did. The workers jeered at the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 204 
parliamentary efforts of the compromisers and called the Predparlament 
(Pre-parliament) a ³predbannik² (³pre-bath-house²). 
The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party decided to boycott 
the Pre-parliament. True, the Bolshevik group in the Pre-parliament, 
consisting of people like Kamenev and Teodorovich, were loath to leave 
it, but the Central Committee of the Party compelled them to do so. 
Kamenev and Zinoviev stubbornly insisted on participation in the 
Pre-parliament, striving thereby to divert the Party from its preparations 
for the uprising. Comrade Stalin, speaking at a meeting of the 
Bolshevik group of the All-Russian Democratic Conference, vigorously 
opposed participation in the Pre-parliament. He called the Pre-parliament 
a ³Kornilov abortion.² 
Lenin and Stalin considered that it would be a grave mistake to 
participate in the Pre-parliament even for a short time, for it might 
encourage in the masses the false hope that the Pre-parliament could 
really do something for the working people. 
At the same time, the Bolsheviks made intensive preparations for the 
convocation of the Second Congress of Soviets, in which they expected 
to have a majority. Under the pressure of the Bolshevik Soviets, and 
notwithstanding the subterfuges of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
on the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the Second 
All-Russian Congress of Soviets was called for the second half of October 
1917. 
6. OCTOBER UPRISING IN PETROGRAD AND ARREST OF THE PROVISIONAL 
GOVERNMENT. SECOND CONGRESS OF SOVIETS AND 
FORMATION OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT. DECREES OF THE 
SECOND CONGRESS OF SOVIETS ON PEACE AND LAND. VICTORY 
OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTION. REASONS FOR THE VICTORY 
OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTION 
The Bolsheviks began intensive preparations for the uprising. Lenin 
declared that, having secured a majority in the Soviets of Workers¹ and 
Soldiers¹ Deputies in both the capitalsMoscow and Petrogradthe 
Bolsheviks could and should take the state power into their own hands. 
Reviewing the path that had been traversed, Lenin stressed the fact 
that ³the majority of the people are for us.² In his articles and letters 
to the Central Committee and the Bolshevik organizations, Lenin outlined 
a detailed plan for the uprising showing how the army units, the 
navy and the Red Guards should be used, what key positions in Petro

205 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
grad should be seized in order to ensure the success of the uprising, and 
so forth. 
On October 7, Lenin secretly arrived in Petrograd from Finland. 
On October 10, 1917, the historic meeting of the Central Committee 
of the Party took place at which it was decided to launch the armed 
uprising within the next few days. The historic resolution of the Central 
Committee of the Party, drawn up by Lenin, stated: 
³The Central Committee recognizes that the international position 
of the Russian revolution (the revolt in the German navy which 
is an extreme manifestation of the growth throughout Europe of the 
world Socialist revolution; the threat of conclusion of peace by the 
imperialists with the object of strangling the revolution in Russia) 
as well as its military position (the indubitable decision of the Russian 
bourgeoisie and Kerensky and Co. to surrender Petrograd to the 
Germans), and the fact that the proletarian party has gained a 
majority in the Sovietsall this, taken in conjunction with the peasant 
revolt and the swing of popular confidence towards our Party 
(the elections in Moscow), and, finally, the obvious preparations 
being made for a second Kornilov affair (the withdrawal of troops 
from Petrograd, the dispatch of Cossacks to Petrograd, the surrounding 
of Minsk by Cossacks, etc.)all this places the armed uprising 
on the order of the day. 
³Considering therefore that an armed uprising is inevitable, and 
that the time for it is fully ripe, the Central Committee instructs all 
Party organizations to be guided accordingly, and to discuss and 
decide all practical questions (the Congress of Soviets of the Northern 
Region, the withdrawal of troops from Petrograd, the action of 
our people in Moscow and Minsk, etc.) from this point of view.² 
(Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. VI, p. 303.) 
Two members of the Central Committee, Kamenev and Zinoviev, 
spoke and voted against this historic decision. Like the Mensheviks, 
they dreamed of a bourgeois parliamentary republic, and slandered the 
working class by asserting that it was not strong enough to carry out a 
Socialist revolution, that it was not mature enough to take power. 
Although at this meeting Trotsky did not vote against the resolution 
directly, he moved an amendment which would have reduced the chances 
of the uprising to nought and rendered it abortive. He proposed that the 
uprising should not be started before the Second Congress of Soviets 
met, a proposal which meant delaying the uprising, divulging its date, 
and forewarning the Provisional Government.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 206
The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party sent its representatives 
to the Donetz Basin, the Urals, Helsingfors, Kronstadt, the South- 
Western Front and other places to organize the uprising. Comrades 
Voroshilov, Molotov, Dzerzhinsky, Ordjonikidze, Kirov, Kaganovich, 
Kuibyshev, Frunze, Yaroslavsky and others were specially assigned by 
the Party to direct the uprising in the provinces. Comrade Zhdanov 
carried on the work among the armed forces in Shadrinsk, in the Urals. 
Comrade Yezhov made preparations for an uprising of the soldiers on the 
Western Front, in Byelorussia. The representatives of the Central Committee 
acquainted the leading members of the Bolshevik organizations 
in the provinces with the plan of the uprising and mobilized them in 
readiness to support the uprising in Petrograd. 
On the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, a Revolutionary 
Military Committee of the Petrograd Soviet was set up. 
This body became the legally functioning headquarters of the uprising. 
Meanwhile the counter-revolutionaries, too, were hastily mustering 
their forces. The officers of the army formed a counter-revolutionary 
organization known as the Officers¹ League. Everywhere the counterrevolutionaries 
set up headquarters for the formation of shock-battalions. 
By the end of October the counter-revolutionaries had 43 shock battalions 
at their command. Special battalions of Cavaliers of the Cross 
of St. George were formed. 
Kerensky¹s government considered the question of transferring the 
seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow. This made it clear that 
it was preparing to surrender Petrograd to the Germans in order to forestall 
the uprising in the city. The protest of the Petrograd workers and 
soldiers compelled the Provisional Government to remain in Petrograd. 
On October 16 an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of 
the Party was held. This meeting elected a Party Centre, headed by 
Comrade Stalin, to direct the uprising. This Party Centre was the 
leading core of the Revolutionary Military Committee of the Petrograd 
Soviet and had practical direction of the whole uprising. 
At the meeting of the Central Committee the capitulators Zinoviev 
and Kamenev again opposed the uprising. Meeting with a rebuff, they 
came out openly in the press against the uprising, against the Party. On 
October 18 the Menshevik newspaper, Novaya Zhizn, printed a statement 
by Kamenev and Zinoviev declaring that the Bolsheviks were 
making preparations for an uprising, and that they (Kamenev and 
Zinoviev) considered it an adventurous gamble. Kamenev and Zinoviev 
thus disclosed to the enemy the decision of the Central Committee regarding 
the uprising, they revealed that an uprising had been planned

207 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
to take place within a few days This was treachery. Lenin wrote in 
this connection: ³Kamenev and Zinoviev have betrayed the decision of 
the Central Committee of their Party on the armed uprising to Rodzyanko 
and Kerensky.² Lenin put before the Central Committee the 
question of Zinoviev¹s and Kamenev¹s expulsion from the Party. 
Forewarned by the traitors, the enemies of the revolution at once 
began to take measures to prevent the uprising and to destroy the directing 
staff of the revolutionthe Bolshevik Party. The Provisional Government 
called a secret meeting which decided upon measures for combating 
the Bolsheviks On October 19 the Provisional Government 
hastily summoned troops from the front to Petrograd. The streets were 
heavily patrolled. The counter-revolutionaries succeeded in massing 
especially large forces in Moscow. The Provisional Government drew 
up a plan: on the eve of the Second Congress of Soviets the Smolny 
the headquarters of the Bolshevik Central Committeewas to be attacked 
and occupied and the Bolshevik directing centre destroyed. For 
this purpose the government summoned to Petrograd troops in whose 
loyalty it believed. 
But the days and even the hours of the Provisional Government 
were already numbered. Nothing could now halt the victorious march 
of the Socialist revolution. 
On October 21 the Bolsheviks sent commissars of the Revolutionary 
Military Committee to all revolutionary army units. Throughout 
the remaining days before the uprising energetic preparations for action 
were made in the army units and in the mills and factories. 
Precise instructions were also issued to the warships Aurora and Zarya 
Svobody. 
At a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotsky in a fit of boasting 
blabbed to the enemy the date on which the Bolsheviks had planned to 
begin the armed uprising. In order not to allow Kerensky¹s government 
to frustrate the uprising, the Central Committee of the Party decided 
to start and carry it through before the appointed time, and set its date 
for the day before the opening of the Second Congress of Soviets. 
Kerensky began his attack on the early morning of October 24 
(November 6) by ordering the suppression of the central organ of the 
Bolshevik Party, Rabochy Put (Workers¹ Path), and the dispatch of 
armoured cars to its editorial premises and to the printing plant of the 
Bolsheviks. By 10 a.m., however, on the instructions of Comrade Stalin, 
Red Guards and revolutionary soldiers pressed back the armoured cars 
and placed a reinforced guard over the printing plant and the Rabochy 
Put editorial offices. Towards 11 a.m. Rabochy Put came out with a call

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 208 
for the overthrow of the Provisional Government. Simultaneously, on 
the instructions of the Party Centre of the uprising, detachments of revolutionary 
soldiers and Red Guards were rushed to the Smolny. 
The uprising had begun. 
On the night of October 24 Lenin arrived at the Smolny and 
assumed personal direction of the uprising. All that night revolutionary 
units of the army and detachments of the Red Guard kept arriving at 
the Smolny. The Bolsheviks directed them to the centre of the capital, 
to surround the Winter Palace, where the Provisional Government had 
entrenched itself. 
On October 25 (November 7), Red Guards and revolutionary 
troops occupied the railway stations, post office, telegraph office, the 
Ministries and the State Bank. 
The Pre-parliament was dissolved. 
The Smolny, the headquarters of the Petrograd Soviet and of the 
Bolshevik Central Committee, became the headquarters of the revolution, 
from which all fighting orders emanated. 
The Petrograd workers in those days showed what a splendid schooling 
they had received under the guidance of the Bolshevik Party. The 
revolutionary units of the army, prepared for the uprising by the work 
of the Bolsheviks, carried out fighting orders with precision and fought 
side by side with the Red Guard. The navy did not lag behind the 
army. Kronstadt was a stronghold of the Bolshevik Party, and had 
long since refused to recognize the authority of the Provisional Government. 
The cruiser Aurora trained its guns on the Winter Palace, and 
on October 25 their thunder ushered in a new era, the era of the Great 
Socialist Revolution. 
On October 25 (November 7) the Bolsheviks issued a manifesto 
³To the Citizens of Russia² announcing that the bourgeois Provisional 
Government had been deposed and that state power had passed into the 
hands of the Soviets. 
The Provisional Government had taken refuge in the Winter Palace 
under the protection of cadets and shock battalions. On the night of 
October 25 the revolutionary workers, soldiers and sailors took the 
Winter Palace by storm and arrested the Provisional Government. 
The armed uprising in Petrograd had won. 
The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets opened in the Smolny 
at 10:45 p.m. on October 25 (November 7), 1917, when the uprising 
in Petrograd was already in the full flush of victory and the power in 
the capital had actually passed into the hands of the Petrograd Soviet. 
The Bolsheviks secured an overwhelming majority at the congress.

209 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
The Mensheviks, Bundists and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, seeing 
that their day was done, left the congress, announcing that they refused 
to take any part in its labours. In a statement which was read at the 
Congress of Soviets they referred to the October Revolution as a ³military 
plot.² The congress condemned the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and, far from regretting their departure, welcomed it, for, it 
declared, thanks to the withdrawal of the traitors the congress had 
become a real revolutionary congress of workers¹ and soldiers¹ deputies. 
The congress proclaimed that all power had passed to the Soviets: 
³Backed by the will of the vast majority of the workers, soldiers 
and peasants, backed by the victorious uprising of the workers and 
the garrison which had taken place in Petrograd, the Congress takes 
the power into its own hands²the proclamation of the Second 
Congress of Soviets read. 
On the night of October 26 (November 8), 1917, the Second 
Congress of Soviets adopted the Decree on Peace. The congress called 
upon the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice for a 
period of not less than three months to permit negotiations for peace. 
While addressing itself to the governments and peoples of all the belligerent 
countries, the congress at the same time appealed to ³the class-conscious 
workers of the three most advanced nations of mankind and the 
largest states participating in the present war, namely, Great Britain, 
France and Germany.² It called upon these workers to help ³to bring 
to a successful conclusion the cause of peace, and at the same time the 
cause of the emancipation of the toiling and exploited masses of the population 
from all forms of slavery and all forms of exploitation.² 
That same night the Second Congress of Soviets adopted the Decree 
on Land, which proclaimed that ³landlord ownership of land is abolished 
forthwith without compensation.² The basis adopted for this 
agrarian law was a Mandate (Nakaz) of the peasantry, compiled from 
242 mandates of peasants of various localities. In accordance with this 
Mandate private ownership of land was to be abolished forever and 
replaced by public, or state ownership of the land. The lands of the 
landlords, of the tsar¹s family and of the monasteries were to be turned 
over to all the toilers for their free use. 
By this decree the peasantry received from the October Socialist 
Revolution over 150,000,000 dessiatins (over 400,000,000 acres) of 
land that had formerly belonged to the landlords, the bourgeoisie, the 
tsar¹s family, the monasteries and the churches. 
Moreover, the peasants were released from paying rent to the landlords, 
which had amounted to about 500,000,000 gold rubles annually.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 210 
All mineral resources (oil, coal, ores, etc.), forests and waters became 
the property of the people. 
Lastly, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets formed the first 
Soviet Governmentthe Council of People¹s Commissarswhich consisted 
entirely of Bolsheviks. Lenin was elected Chairman of the first 
Council of People¹s Commissars. 
This ended the labours of the historic Second Congress of Soviets. 
The congress delegates dispersed to spread the news of the victory of 
the Soviets in Petrograd and to ensure the extension of the power of 
the Soviets to the whole country. 
Not everywhere did power pass to the Soviets at once. While in 
Petrograd the Soviet Government was already in existence, in Moscow 
fierce and stubborn fighting continued in the streets several days longer. 
In order to prevent the power from passing into the hands of the Moscow 
Soviet, the counter-revolutionary Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary 
parties, together with Whiteguards and cadets, started an armed fight 
against the workers and soldiers. It took several days to rout the rebels 
and to establish the power of the Soviets in Moscow. 
In Petrograd itself, and in several of its districts, counter-revolutionary 
attempts to overthrow the Soviet power were made in the 
very first days of the victory of the revolution. On November 10, 1917, 
Kerensky, who during the uprising had fled from Petrograd to the 
Northern Front, mustered several Cossack units and dispatched them 
against Petrograd under the command of General Krasnov. On November 
11, 1917, a counter-revolutionary organization calling itself the 
³Committee for the Salvation of the Fatherland and the Revolution,² 
headed by Socialist-Revolutionaries, raised a mutiny of cadets in Petrograd. 
But the mutiny was suppressed by sailors and Red Guards without 
much difficulty by the evening of the same day, and on November 13 
General Krasnov was routed near the Pulkovo Hills. Lenin personally 
directed the suppression of the anti-Soviet mutiny, just as he had personally 
directed the October uprising. His inflexible firmness and calm 
confidence of victory inspired and welded the masses. The enemy was 
smashed. Krasnov was taken prisoner and pledged his ³word of honour² 
to terminate the struggle against the Soviet power. And on his ³word 
of honour² he was released. But, as it later transpired, the general violated 
his word of honour. As to Kerensky, disguised as a woman, he 
managed to ³disappear in an unknown direction.² 
In Moghilev, at the General Headquarters of the Army, General 
Dukhonin, the Commander-in-Chief, also attempted a mutiny. When 
the Soviet Government instructed him to start immediate negotiations for

211 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
an armistice with the German Command, he refused to obey. Thereupon 
Dukhonin was dismissed by order of the Soviet Government. The 
counter-revolutionary General Headquarters was broken up and Dukhonin 
himself was killed by the soldiers, who had risen against him. 
Certain notorious opportunists within the PartyKamenev, Zinoviev, 
Rykov, Shlyapnikov and othersalso made a sally against the Soviet 
power. They demanded the formation of an ³all-Socialist government² 
to include Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who had just been 
overthrown by the October Revolution. On November 15, 1917, the 
Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party adopted a resolution rejecting 
agreement with these counter-revolutionary parties, and proclaiming 
Kamenev and Zinoviev strikebreakers of the revolution. On November 
17, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov and Milyutin, disagreeing with the policy 
of the Party, announced their resignation from the Central Committee. 
That same day, November 17, Nogin, in his own name and in the names 
of Rykov, V. Milyutin, Teodorovich, A. Shlyapnikov, D. Ryazanov, 
Yurenev and Larin, members of the Council of People¹s Commissars, 
announced their disagreement with the policy of the Central Committee 
of the Party and their resignation from the Council of People¹s Commissars. 
The desertion of this handful of cowards caused jubilation 
among the enemies of the October Revolution. The bourgeoisie and its 
henchmen proclaimed with malicious glee the collapse of Bolshevism and 
presaged the early end of the Bolshevik Party. But not for a moment 
was the Party shaken by this handful of deserters. The Central Committee 
of the Party contemptuously branded them as deserters from the 
revolution and accomplices of the bourgeoisie, and proceeded with its work. 
As to the ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries, they, desirous of retaining 
their influence over the peasant masses, who definitely sympathized 
with the Bolsheviks, decided not to quarrel with the latter and for the 
time being to maintain a united front with them. The Congress of Peasant 
Soviets which took place in November 1917 recognized all the gains 
of the October Socialist Revolution and endorsed the decrees of the Soviet 
Government. An agreement was concluded with the ³Left² Socialist- 
Revolutionaries and several of their number were given posts on the 
Council of People¹s Commissars (Kolegayev, Spiridonova, Proshyan and 
Steinberg). However, this agreement lasted only until the signing of the 
Peace of Brest-Litovsk and the formation of the Committees of the Poor 
Peasants, when a deep cleavage took place among the peasantry and 
when the ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries, coming more and more to 
reflect the interests of the kulaks, started a revolt against the Bolsheviks 
and were routed by the Soviet Government.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 212 
In the interval from October 1917 to February 1918 the Soviet 
revolution spread throughout the vast territory of the country at such 
a rapid rate that Lenin referred to it as a ³triumphal march² of Soviet 
power. 
The Great October Socialist Revolution had won. 
There were several reasons for this comparatively easy victory of the 
Socialist revolution in Russia. The following chief reasons should be 
noted: 
1) The October Revolution was confronted by an enemy so comparatively 
weak, so badly organized and so politically inexperienced as the 
Russian bourgeoisie. Economically still weak, and completely dependent 
on government contracts, the Russian bourgeoisie lacked sufficient political 
self-reliance and initiative to find a way out of the situation. It had 
neither the experience of the French bourgeoisie, for example, in political 
combination and political chicanery on a broad scale nor the schooling of 
the British bourgeoisie in broadly conceived crafty compromise. It had 
but recently sought to reach an understanding with the tsar; yet now that 
the tsar had been overthrown by the February Revolution, and the bourgeoisie 
itself had come to power, it was unable to think of anything better 
than to continue the policy of the detested tsar in all its essentials. Like 
the tsar, it stood for ³war to a victorious finish,² although the war was 
beyond the country¹s strength and had reduced the people and the army 
to a state of utter exhaustion. Like the tsar, it stood for the preservation 
in the main of big landed property, although the peasantry was perishing 
from lack of land and the weight of the landlord¹s yoke. As to its labour 
policy the Russian bourgeoisie outstripped even the tsar in its hatred of 
the working class, for it not only strove to preserve and strengthen the 
yoke of the factory owners, but to render it intolerable by wholesale 
lockouts. 
It is not surprising that the people saw no essential difference between 
the policy of the tsar and the policy of the bourgeoisie, and that they 
transferred their hatred of the tsar to the Provisional Government of 
the bourgeoisie. 
As long as the compromising Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik 
parties possessed a certain amount of influence among the people, the 
bourgeoisie could use them as a screen and preserve its power. But after 
the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had exposed themselves as 
agents of the imperialist bourgeoisie, thus forfeiting their influence among 
the people, the bourgeoisie and its Provisional Government were left 
without a support. 
2) The October Revolution was headed by so revolutionary a class

213 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
as the working class of Russia, a class which had been steeled in battle, 
which had in a short space passed through two revolutions, and which by 
the eve of the third revolution had won recognition as the leader of the 
people in the struggle for peace, land, liberty and Socialism. If the revolution 
had not had a leader like the working class of Russia, a leader that 
had earned the confidence of the people, there would have been no 
alliance between the workers and peasants, and without such an alliance 
the victory of the October Revolution would have been impossible. 
3) The working class of Russia had so effective an ally in the revolution 
as the poor peasantry, which comprised the overwhelming majority 
of the peasant population. The experience of eight months of revolution 
which may unhesitatingly be compared to the experience of several 
decades of ³normal² developmenthad not been in vain as far as the 
mass of the labouring peasants were concerned. During this period they 
had had the opportunity to test all the parties of Russia in practice and 
convince themselves that neither the Constitutional-Democrats, nor the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks would seriously quarrel with 
the landlords or sacrifice themselves for the interests of the peasants; 
that there was only one party in Russiathe Bolshevik Partywhich 
was in no way connected with the landlords and which was prepared 
to crush them in order to satisfy the needs of the peasants. This served 
as a solid basis for the alliance of the proletariat and the poor peasantry. 
The existence of this alliance between the working class and the poor 
peasantry determined the conduct of the middle peasants, who had long 
been vacillating and only on the eve of the October uprising wholeheartedly 
swung over towards the revolution and joined forces with the poor 
peasants. 
It goes without saying that without this alliance the October Revolution 
could not have been victorious. 
4) The working class was headed by a party so tried and tested 
in political battles as the Bolshevik Party. Only a party like the Bolshevik 
Party, courageous enough to lead the people in decisive attack, and 
cautious enough to keep clear of all the submerged rocks in its path to 
the goalonly such a party could so skilfully merge into one common 
revolutionary torrent such diverse revolutionary movements as the general 
democratic movement for peace, the peasant democratic movement for 
the seizure of the landed estates, the movement of the oppressed nationalities 
for national liberation and national equality, and the Socialist 
movement of the proletariat for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and 
the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Undoubtedly, the merging of these diverse revolutionary streams

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
into one common powerful revolutionary torrent decided the fate of 
capitalism in Russia. 
5) The October Revolution began at a time when the imperialist 
war was still at its height, when the principal bourgeois states were split 
into two hostile camps, and when, absorbed in mutual war and undermining 
each other¹s strength, they were unable to intervene effectively 
in ³Russian affairs² and actively to oppose the October Revolution. 
This undoubtedly did much to facilitate the victory of the October 
Socialist Revolution. 
7. STRUGGLE OF THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY TO CONSOLIDATE THE 
SOVIET POWER. PEACE OF BREST-LITOVSK. SEVENTH PARTY 
CONGRESS 
In order to consolidate the Soviet power, the old, bourgeois state 
machine had to be shattered and destroyed and a new, Soviet state 
machine set up in its place. Further, it was necessary to destroy the 
survivals of the division of society into estates and the regime of national 
oppression, to abolish the privileges of the church, to suppress the counterrevolutionary 
press and counter-revolutionary organizations of all kinds, 
legal and illegal, and to dissolve the bourgeois Constituent Assembly. 
Following on the nationalization of the land, all large-scale industry 
had also to be nationalized. And, lastly, the state of war had to be 
ended, for the war was hampering the consolidation of the Soviet power 
more than anything else. 
All these measures were carried out in the course of a few months, 
from the end of 1917 to the middle of 1918. 
The sabotage of the officials of the old Ministries, engineered by 
the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, was smashed and overcome. 
The Ministries were abolished and replaced by Soviet administrative 
machinery and appropriate People¹s Commissariats. The Supreme 
Council of National Economy was set up to administer the 
industry of the country. The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission 
(Vecheka) was created to combat counter-revolution and sabotage, and 
F. Dzerzhinsky was placed at its head. The formation of a Red Army 
and Navy was decreed. The Constituent Assembly, the elections to 
which had largely been held prior to the October Revolution, and which 
refused to recognize the decrees of the Second Congress of Soviets on 
peace, land and the transfer of power to the Soviets, was dissolved. 
In order to put an end to the survivals of feudalism, the estates 
system, and inequality in all spheres of social life, decrees were issued 
abolishing the estates, removing restrictions based on nationality or religion,

215 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
separating the church from the state and the schools from the church, 
establishing equality for women and the equality of all the nationalities 
of Russia. 
A special edict of the Soviet Government known as ³The Declaration 
of Rights of the Peoples of Russia² laid down as a law the right 
of the peoples of Russia to unhampered development and complete 
equality. 
In order to undermine the economic power of the bourgeoisie and 
to create a new, Soviet national economy, and, in the first place, to 
create a new, Soviet industry, the banks, railways, foreign trade, the 
mercantile fleet and all large enterprises in all branches of industry 
coal, metal, oil, chemicals, machine-building, textiles, sugar, etc.were 
nationalized. 
To render our country financially independent of the foreign capitalists 
and free from exploitation by them, the foreign loans contracted 
by the Russian tsar and the Provisional Government were annulled. 
The people of our country refused to pay debts which had been incurred 
for the continuation of the war of conquest and which had placed our 
country in bondage to foreign capital. 
These and similar measures undermined the very root of the power 
of the bourgeoisie, the landlords, the reactionary officials and the counterrevolutionary 
parties, and considerably strengthened the position of the 
Soviet Government within the country. 
But the position of the Soviet Government could not be deemed 
fully secure as long as Russia was in a state of war with Germany and 
Austria. In order finally to consolidate the Soviet power, the war had 
to be ended. The Party therefore launched the fight for peace from 
the moment of the victory of the October Revolution. 
The Soviet Government called upon ³all the belligerent peoples and 
their governments to start immediate negotiations for a just, democratic 
peace.² But the ³allies²Great Britain and Francerefused to accept 
the proposal of the Soviet Government. In view of this refusal, the 
Soviet Government, in compliance with the will of the Soviets, decided 
to start negotiations with Germany and Austria. 
The negotiations began on December 3 in Brest-Litovsk. On 
December 5 an armistice was signed. 
The negotiations took place at a time when the country was in a 
state of economic disruption, when war-weariness was universal, when 
our troops were abandoning the trenches and the front was collapsing. 
It became clear in the course of the negotiations that the German imperialists 
were out to seize huge portions of the territory of the former

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 216 
tsarist empire, and to turn Poland, the Ukraine and the Baltic countries 
into dependencies of Germany. 
To continue the war under such conditions would have meant staking 
the very existence of the new-born Soviet Republic. The working 
class and the peasantry were confronted with the necessity of accepting 
onerous terms of peace, of retreating before the most dangerous marauder 
of the timeGerman imperialismin order to secure a respite 
in which to strengthen the Soviet power and to create a new army, the 
Red Army, which would be able to defend the country from enemy 
attack. 
All the counter-revolutionaries, from the Mensheviks and Socialist- 
Revolutionaries to the most arrant Whiteguards, conducted a frenzied 
campaign against the conclusion of peace. Their policy was clear: they 
wanted to wreck the peace negotiations, provoke a German offensive 
and thus imperil the still weak Soviet power and endanger the gains 
of the workers and peasants. 
Their allies in this sinister scheme were Trotsky and his accomplice 
Bukharin, the latter, together with Radek and Pyatakov, heading a 
group which was hostile to the Party but camouflaged itself under the 
name of ³Left Communists.² Trotsky and the group of ³Left Communists² 
began a fierce struggle within the Party against Lenin, demanding 
the continuation of the war. These people were clearly 
playing into the hands of the German imperialists and the counterrevolutionaries 
within the country, for they were working to expose the 
young Soviet Republic, which had not yet any army, to the blows of 
German imperialism. 
This was really a policy of provocateurs, skilfully masked by Left 
phraseology. 
On February 10, 1918, the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk were 
broken off. Although Lenin and Stalin, in the name of the Central 
Committee of the Party, had insisted that peace be signed, Trotsky, 
who was chairman of the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, treacherously 
violated the direct instructions of the Bolshevik Party. He announced 
that the Soviet Republic refused to conclude peace on the 
terms proposed by Germany. At the same time he informed the Germans 
that the Soviet Republic would not fight and would continue to 
demobilize the army. 
This was monstrous. The German imperialists could have desired 
nothing more from this traitor to the interests of the Soviet country. 
The German government broke the armistice and assumed the 
offensive. The remnants of our old army crumbled and scattered be

217 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 1 8 
fore the onslaught of the German troops. The Germans advanced 
swiftly, seizing enormous territory and threatening Petrograd. German 
imperialism invaded the Soviet land with the object of overthrowing 
the Soviet power and converting our country into its colony. The ruins 
of the old tsarist army could not withstand the armed hosts of German 
imperialism, and steadily retreated under their blows. 
But the armed intervention of the German imperialists was the 
signal for a mighty revolutionary upsurge in the country. The Party 
and the Soviet Government issued the call³The Socialist fatherland 
is in danger!² And in response the working class energetically began 
to form regiments of the Red Army. The young detachments of the 
new armythe army of the revolutionary peopleheroically resisted 
the German marauders who were armed to the teeth. At Narva and 
Pskov the German invaders met with a resolute repulse. Their advance 
on Petrograd was checked. February 23the day the forces of German 
imperialism were repulsedis regarded as the birthday of the Red Army. 
On February 18, 1918, the Central Committee of the Party had 
approved Lenin¹s proposal to send a telegram to the German government 
offering to conclude an immediate peace. But in order to secure 
more advantageous terms, the Germans continued to advance, and only 
on February 22 did the German government express its willingness to 
sign peace. The terms were now far more onerous than those originally 
proposed. 
Lenin, Stalin and Sverdlov had to wage a stubborn fight on the 
Central Committee against Trotsky, Bukharin and the other Trotskyites 
before they secured a decision in favour of the conclusion of peace. 
Bukharin and Trotsky, Lenin declared, ³actually helped the German 
imperialists and hindered the growth and development of the revolution 
in Germany.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXII, p. 307.) 
On February 23, the Central Committee decided to accept the terms 
of the German Command and to sign the peace treaty. The treachery 
of Trotsky and Bukharin cost the Soviet Republic dearly. Latvia, Esthonia, 
not to mention Poland, passed into German hands; the Ukraine 
was severed from the Soviet Republic and converted into a vassal of 
the German state. The Soviet Republic undertook to pay an indemnity 
to the Germans. 
Meanwhile, the ³Left Communists² continued their struggle against 
Lenin, sinking deeper and deeper into the slough of treachery. 
The Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party, of which the ³Left 
Communists² (Bukharin, Ossinsky, Yakovleva, Stukov and Mantsev)

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 218 
had temporarily seized control, passed a resolution of no-confidence in 
the Central Committee, a resolution designed to split the Party. The 
Bureau declared that it considered ³a split in the Party in the very 
near future scarcely avoidable.² The ³Left Communists² even went 
so far in their resolution as to adopt an anti-Soviet stand. ³In the interests 
of the international revolution,² they declared, ³we consider it expedient 
to consent to the possible loss of the Soviet power, which has 
now become purely formal.² 
Lenin branded this decision as ³strange and monstrous.² 
At that time the real cause of this anti-Party behaviour of Trotsky 
and the ³Left Communists² was not yet clear to the Party. But the 
recent trial of the Anti-Soviet ³Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites² (beginning 
of 1938) has now revealed that Bukharin and the group of ³Left 
Communists² headed by him, together with Trotsky and the ³Left² 
Socialist-Revolutionaries, were at that time secretly conspiring against 
the Soviet Government. Now it is known that Bukharin, Trotsky and 
their fellow-conspirators had determined to wreck the Peace of Brest- 
Litovsk, arrest V. I. Lenin, J. V. Stalin and Y. M. Sverdlov, assassinate 
them, and form a new government consisting of Bukharinites, Trotskyites 
and ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
While hatching this clandestine counter-revolutionary plot, the group 
of ³Left Communists,² with the support of Trotsky, openly attacked 
the Bolshevik Party, trying to split it and to disintegrate its ranks. But 
at this grave juncture the Party rallied around Lenin, Stalin and Sverdlov 
and supported the Central Committee on the question of peace as on 
all other questions. 
The ³Left Communist² group was isolated and defeated. 
In order that the Party might pronounce its final decision on the 
question of peace the Seventh Party Congress was summoned. 
The congress opened on March 6, 1918. This was the first congress 
held after our Party had taken power. It was attended by 46 
delegates with vote and 58 delegates with voice but no vote, representing 
145,000 Party members. Actually, the membership of the Party 
at that time was not less than 270,000. The discrepancy was due to 
the fact that, owing to the urgency with which the congress met, a large 
number of the organizations were unable to send delegates in time; and 
the organizations in the territories then occupied by the Germans were 
unable to send delegates at all. 
Reporting at this congress on the Brest-Litovsk Peace, Lenin said 
that ³. . . the severe crisis which our Party is now experiencing, owing 
to the formation of a Left opposition within it, is one of the gravest

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 219 
crises the Russian revolution has experienced.² (Lenin, Selected Works, 
Vol. VII, pp. 293-94.) 
The resolution submitted by Lenin on the subject of the Brest-Litovsk 
Peace was adopted by 30 votes against 12, with 4 abstentions. 
On the day following the adoption of this resolution, Lenin wrote 
an article entitled ³A Distressful Peace,² in which he said: 
³Intolerably severe are the terms of peace. Nevertheless, history 
will claim its own. . . . Let us set to work to organize, organize 
and organize. Despite all trials, the future is ours.² (Lenin, Collected 
Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXII, p. 288.) 
In its resolution, the congress declared that further military attacks 
by imperialist states on the Soviet Republic were inevitable, and that 
therefore the congress considered it the fundamental task of the Party to 
adopt the most energetic and resolute measures to strengthen the selfdiscipline 
and discipline of the workers and peasants, to prepare the 
masses for self-sacrificing defence of the Socialist country, to organize 
the Red Army, and to introduce universal military training. 
Endorsing Lenin¹s policy with regard to the Peace of Brest-Litovsk, 
the congress condemned the position of Trotsky and Bukharin and stigmatized 
the attempt of the defeated ³Left Communists² to continue 
their splitting activities at the congress itself. 
The Peace of Brest-Litovsk gave the Party a respite in which to consolidate 
the Soviet power and to organize the economic life of the country. 
The peace made it possible to take advantage of the conflicts within 
the imperialist camp (the war of Austria and Germany with the Entente, 
which was still in progress) to disintegrate the forces of the enemy, to 
organize a Soviet economic system and to create a Red Army. 
The peace made it possible for the proletariat to retain the support 
of the peasantry and to accumulate strength for the defeat of the Whiteguard 
generals in the Civil War. 
In the period of the October Revolution Lenin taught the Bolshevik 
Party how to advance fearlessly and resolutely when conditions favoured 
an advance. In the period of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Lenin taught the 
Party how to retreat in good order when the forces of the enemy are 
obviously superior to our own, in order to prepare with the utmost 
energy for a new offensive. 
History has fully proved the correctness of Lenin¹s line. 
It was decided at the Seventh Congress to change the name of the 
Party and to alter the Party Program. The name of the Party was 
changed to the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)R.C.P.(B.). 
Lenin proposed to call our Party a Communist Party because this name

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 220 
precisely corresponded to the aim of the Party, namely, the achievement 
of Communism. 
A special commission, which included Lenin and Stalin, was elected 
to draw up a new Party program, Lenin¹s draft program having been 
accepted as a basis. 
Thus the Seventh Congress accomplished a task of profound historical 
importance: it defeated the enemy hidden within the Party¹s ranks 
the ³Left Communists² and Trotskyites; it succeeded in withdrawing 
the country from the imperialist war; it secured peace and a respite; it 
enabled the Party to gain time for the organization of the Red Army; 
and it set the Party the task of introducing Socialist order in the national 
economy. 
8. LENIN¹S PLAN FOR THE INITIAL STEPS IN SOCIALIST CONSTRUCTION. 
COMMITTEES OF THE POOR PEASANTS AND THE 
CURBING OF THE KULAKS. REVOLT OF THE ³LEFT² SOCIALIST-
REVOLUTIONARIES AND ITS SUPPRESSION. FIFTH 
CONGRESS OF SOVIETS AND ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION 
OF THE R.S.F.S.R. 
Having concluded peace and thus gained a respite, the Soviet Government 
set about the work of Socialist construction. Lenin called the 
period from November 1917 to February 1918 the stage of ³the Red 
Guard attack on capital.² During the first half of 1918 the Soviet 
Government succeeded in breaking the economic might of the bourgeoisie, 
in concentrating in its own hands the key positions of the national 
economy (mills, factories, banks, railways, foreign trade, mercantile 
fleet, etc.), smashing the bourgeois machinery of state power, and victoriously 
crushing the first attempts of the counter-revolution to overthrow 
the Soviet power. 
But this was by no means enough. If there was to be progress, the 
destruction of the old order had to be followed by the building of a new. 
Accordingly, in the spring of 1918, a transition was begun ³from the 
expropriation of the expropriators² to a new stage of Socialist construction
the organizational consolidation of the victories gained, the building 
of the Soviet national economy. Lenin held that the utmost advantage 
should be taken of the respite in order to begin to lay the foundation 
of the Socialist economic system. The Bolsheviks had to learn to organize 
and manage production in a new way. The Bolshevik Party had 
convinced Russia, Lenin wrote; the Bolshevik Party had wrested Russia 
for the people from the hands of the rich, and now the Bolsheviks must 
learn to govern Russia.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 221 
Lenin held that the chief task at the given stage was to keep account 
of everything the country produced and to exercise control over the 
distribution of all products. Petty-bourgeois elements predominated in 
the economic system of the country. The millions of small owners in 
town and country were a breeding ground for capitalism. These small 
owners recognized neither labour discipline nor civil discipline; they 
would not submit to a system of state accounting and control. What 
was particularly dangerous at this difficult juncture was the petty-bourgeois 
welter of speculation and profiteering, the attempts of the small 
owners and traders to profit by the people¹s want. 
The Party started a vigorous war on slovenliness in work, on the 
absence of labour discipline in industry. The masses were slow in acquiring 
new habits of labour. The struggle for labour discipline consequently 
became the major task of the period. 
Lenin pointed to the necessity of developing Socialist emulation 
in industry; of introducing the piece rate system; of combating wage 
equalization; of resortingin addition to methods of education and 
persuasionto methods of compulsion with regard to those who wanted 
to grab as much as possible from the state, with regard to idlers and 
profiteers. He maintained that the new disciplinethe discipline of 
labour, the discipline of comradely relations, Soviet disciplinewas something 
that would be evolved by the labouring millions in the course of 
their daily, practical work, and that ³this task will take up a whole 
historical epoch.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. VII, p. 393.) 
All these problems of Socialist construction, of the new, Socialist 
relations of production, were dealt with by Lenin in his celebrated work, 
The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government. 
The ³Left Communists,² acting in conjunction with the Socialist- 
Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, fought Lenin over these questions too. 
Bukharin, Ossinsky and others were opposed to the introduction of discipline, 
one-man management in the enterprises, the employment of 
bourgeois experts in industry, and the introduction of efficient business 
methods. They slandered Lenin by claiming that this policy would mean 
a return to bourgeois conditions. At the same time, the ³Left Communists² 
preached the Trotskyite view that Socialist construction and the 
victory of socialism in Russia were impossible. 
The ³Left² phraseology of the ³Left Communists² served to camouflage 
their defence of the kulaks, idlers and profiteers who were opposed 
to discipline and hostile to the state regulation of economic life, to accounting 
and control. 
Having settled on the principles of organization of the new, Soviet 
industry, the Party proceeded to tackle the problems of the countryside,

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 222 
which at this period was in the throes of a struggle between the poor 
peasants and the kulaks. The kulaks were gaining strength and seizing 
the lands confiscated from the landlords. The poor peasants needed 
assistance. The kulaks fought the proletarian government and refused 
to sell grain to it at fixed prices. They wanted to starve the Soviet state 
into renouncing Socialist measures. The Party set the task of smashing 
the counter-revolutionary kulaks. Detachments of industrial workers were 
sent into the countryside with the object of organizing the poor peasants 
and ensuring the success of the struggle against the kulaks, who were 
holding back their grain surpluses. 
³Comrades, workers, remember that the revolution is in a critical 
situation,² Lenin wrote. ³Remember that you alone can save the 
revolution, nobody else. What we need is tens of thousands of picked, 
politically advanced workers, loyal to the cause of Socialism, incapable 
of succumbing to bribery and the temptations of pilfering, and capable 
of creating an iron force against the kulaks, profiteers, marauders, 
bribers and disorganizers.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., 
Vol. XXIII, p. 25.) 
³The struggle for bread is a struggle for Socialism,² Lenin said. 
And it was under this slogan that the sending of workers¹ detachments 
to the rural districts was organized. A number of decrees were issued 
establishing a food dictatorship and conferring emergency powers on the 
organs of the People¹s Commissariat of Food for the purchase of grain 
at fixed prices. 
A decree was issued on June 11, 1918, providing for the creation 
of Committees of the Poor Peasants. These committees played an important 
part in the struggle against the kulaks, in the redistribution of the 
confiscated land and the distribution of agricultural implements, in the 
collection of food surpluses from the kulaks, and in the supply of foodstuffs 
to the working-class centres and the Red Army. Fifty million 
hectares of kulak land passed into the hands of the poor and middle 
peasants. A large portion of the kulaks¹ means of production was confiscated 
and turned over to the poor peasants. 
The formation of the Committees of the Poor Peasants was a further 
stage in the development of the Socialist revolution in the countryside. 
The committees were strongholds of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
in the villages. It was largely through them that enlistment for the Red 
Army was carried out among the peasants. 
The proletarian campaign in the rural districts and the organization 
of the Committees of the Poor Peasants consolidated the Soviet power

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 223 
in the countryside and were of tremendous political importance in winning 
over the middle peasants to the side of the Soviet Government. 
At the end of 1918, when their task had been completed, the Committees 
of the Poor Peasants were merged with the rural Soviets and 
their existence was thus terminated. 
At the Fifth Congress of Soviets which opened on July 4, 1918, 
the ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries launched a fierce attack on Lenin in 
defence of the kulaks. They demanded the discontinuation of the fight 
against the kulaks and of the dispatch of workers¹ food detachments into 
the countryside. When the ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries saw that the 
majority of the congress was firmly opposed to their policy, they started 
a revolt in Moscow and seized Tryokhsvyatitelsky Alley, from which 
they began to shell the Kremlin. This foolhardy outbreak was put down 
by the Bolsheviks within a few hours. Attempts at revolt were made by 
³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries in other parts of the country, but everywhere 
these outbreaks were speedily suppressed. 
As the trial of the Anti-Soviet ³Block of Rights and Trotskyites² 
has now established, the revolt of the ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries 
was started with the knowledge and consent of Bukharin and Trotsky 
and was part of a general counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the Bukharinites, 
Trotskyites and ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries against the 
Soviet power. 
At this juncture, too, a ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionary by name of 
Blumkin, afterwards an agent of Trotsky, made his way into the German 
Embassy and assassinated Mirbach, the German Ambassador in 
Moscow, with the object of provoking a war with Germany. But the 
Soviet Government managed to avert war and to frustrate the provocateur 
designs of the counter-revolutionaries. 
The Fifth Congress of Soviets adopted the First Soviet Constitution 
the Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
During the eight months, February to October 1917, the Bolshevik 
Party accomplished the very difficult task of winning over the majority 
of the working class and the majority in the Soviets, and enlisting the 
support of millions of peasants for the Socialist revolution. It wrested 
these masses from the influence of the petty-bourgeois parties (Socialist- 
Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Anarchists), by exposing the policy of 
these parties step by step and showing that it ran counter to the interests 
of the working people. The Bolshevik Party carried on extensive political

TO MAO 


DISTRIBUTION 
work at the front and in the rear, preparing the masses for the October 
Socialist Revolution. 
The events of decisive importance in the history of the Party at this 
period were Lenin¹s arrival from exile abroad, his April Theses, the 
April Party Conference and the Sixth Party Congress. The Party decisions 
were a source of strength to the working class and inspired it with 
confidence in victory; in them the workers found solutions to the important 
problems of the revolution. The April Conference directed the 
efforts of the Party to the struggle for the transition from the bourgeoisdemocratic 
revolution to the Socialist revolution. The Sixth Congress 
headed the Party for an armed uprising against the bourgeoisie and its 
Provisional Government. 
The compromising Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties, 
the Anarchists, and the other non-Communist parties completed the 
cycle of their development: they all became bourgeois parties even before 
the October Revolution and fought for the preservation and integrity 
of the capitalist system. The Bolshevik Party was the only party 
which led the struggle of the masses for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie 
and the establishment of the power of the Soviets. 
At the same time, the Bolsheviks defeated the attempts of the capitulators 
within the PartyZinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, Bukharin, 
Trotsky and Pyatakovto deflect the Party from the path of Socialist 
revolution. 
Headed by the Bolshevik Party, the working class, in alliance with 
the poor peasants, and with the support of the soldiers and sailors, overthrew 
the power of the bourgeoisie, established the power of the Soviets, 
set up a new type of statea Socialist Soviet stateabolished the landlords¹ 
ownership of land, turned over the land to the peasants for their 
use, nationalized all the land in the country, expropriated the capitalists, 
achieved the withdrawal of Russia from the war and obtained peace, 
that is, obtained a much-needed respite, and thus created the conditions 
for the development of Socialist construction. 
The October Socialist Revolution smashed capitalism, deprived the 
bourgeoisie of the means of production and converted the mills, factories, 
land, railways and banks into the property of the whole people, into 
public property. 
It established the dictatorship of the proletariat and turned over the 
government of the vast country to the working class, thus making it the 
ruling class. 
The October Socialist Revolution thereby ushered in a new era 
in the history of mankindthe era of proletarian revolutions.

THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY IN THE PERIOD 
OF FOREIGN MILITARY INTERVENTION 
AND CIVIL WAR 
( 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 ) 
1. BEGINNING OF FOREIGN MILITARY INTERVENTION. FIRST 
PERIOD OF THE CIVIL WAR 
The conclusion of the Peace of Brest-Litovsk and the consolidation 
of the Soviet power, as a result of a series of revolutionary economic 
measures adopted by it, at a time when the war in the West was still 
in full swing, created profound alarm among the Western imperialists, 
especially those of the Entente countries. 
The Entente imperialists feared that the conclusion of peace between 
Germany and Russia might improve Germany¹s position in the war 
and correspondingly worsen the position of their own armies. They 
feared, moreover, that peace between Russia and Germany might stimulate 
the craving for peace in all countries and on all fronts, and thus 
interfere with the prosecution of the war and damage the cause of the 
imperialists. Lastly, they feared that the existence of a Soviet government 
on the territory of a vast country, and the success it had achieved 
at home after the overthrow of the power of the bourgeoisie, might 
serve as an infectious example for the workers and soldiers of the West. 
Profoundly discontented with the protracted war, the workers and soldiers 
might follow in the footsteps of the Russians and turn their bayonets 
against their masters and oppressors. Consequently, the Entente governments 
decided to intervene in Russia by armed force with the object 
of overthrowing the Soviet Government and establishing a bourgeois 
government, which would restore the bourgeois system in the country, 
annul the peace treaty with the Germans and re-establish the military 
front against Germany and Austria. 
The Entente imperialists launched upon this sinister enterprise all the 
more readily because they were convinced that the Soviet Government 
was unstable; they had no doubt that with some effort on the part of its 
enemies its early fall would be inevitable. 
The achievements of the Soviet Government and its consolidation 
created even greater alarm among the deposed classes the landlords 
225

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 226 
and capitalists; in the ranks of the vanquished partiesthe Constitutional-
Democrats, Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Anarchists and 
the bourgeois nationalists of all hues; and among the Whiteguard generals, 
Cossack officers, etc. 
From the very first days of the victorious October Revolution, all 
these hostile elements began to shout from the housetops that there was 
no ground in Russia for a Soviet power, that it was doomed, that it was 
bound to fall within a week or two, or a month, or two or three months 
at most. But as the Soviet Government, despite the imprecations of its 
enemies, continued to exist and gain strength, its foes within Russia 
were forced to admit that it was much stronger than they had imagined, 
and that its overthrow would require great efforts and a fierce struggle 
on the part of all the forces of counter-revolution. They therefore decided 
to embark upon counter-revolutionary insurrectionary activities on 
a broad scale: to mobilize the forces of counter-revolution, to assemble 
military cadres and to organize revolts, especially in the Cossack and 
kulak districts. 
Thus, already in the first half of 1918, two definite forces took 
shape that were prepared to embark upon the overthrow of the Soviet 
power, namely, the foreign imperialists of the Entente and the counterrevolutionaries 
at home. 
Neither of these forces possessed all the requisites needed to undertake 
the overthrow of the Soviet Government singly. The counter-revolutionaries 
in Russia had certain military cadres and man-power, drawn 
principally from the upper classes of the Cossacks and from the kulaks, 
enough to start a rebellion against the Soviet Government. But they 
possessed neither money nor arms. The foreign imperialists, on the other 
hand, had the money and the arms, but could not ³release² a sufficient 
number of troops for purposes of intervention; they could not do so, not 
only because these troops were required for the war with Germany and 
Austria, but because they might not prove altogether reliable in a war 
against the Soviet power. 
The conditions of the struggle against the Soviet power dictated a 
union of the two anti-Soviet forces, foreign and domestic. And this 
union was effected in the first half of 1918. 
This was how the foreign military intervention against the Soviet 
power supported by counter-revolutionary revolts of its foes at home 
originated. 
This was the end of the respite in Russia and the beginning of the 
Civil War, which was a war of the workers and peasants of the nations 
of Russia against the foreign and domestic enemies of the Soviet power.

227 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
The imperialists of Great Britain, France, Japan and America 
started their military intervention without any declaration of war, although 
the intervention was a war, a war against Russia, and the worst 
kind of war at that. These ³civilized² marauders secretly and stealthily 
made their way to Russian shores and landed their troops on Russia¹s 
territory. 
The British and French landed troops in the north, occupied Archangel 
and Murmansk, supported a local Whiteguard revolt, overthrew 
the Soviets and set up a White ³Government of North Russia.² 
The Japanese landed troops in Vladivostok, seized the Maritime 
Province, dispersed the Soviets and supported the Whiteguard rebels, 
who subsequently restored the bourgeois system. 
In the North Caucasus, Generals Kornilov, Alexeyev and Denikin, 
with the support of the British and French, formed a Whiteguard 
³Volunteer Army,² raised a revolt of the upper classes of the Cossacks 
and started hostilities against the Soviets. 
On the Don, Generals Krasnov and Mamontov, with the secret support 
of the German imperialists (the Germans hesitated to support 
them openly owing to the peace treaty between Germany and Russia), 
raised a revolt of Don Cossacks, occupied the Don region and started 
hostilities against the Soviets. 
In the Middle Volga region and in Siberia, the British and French 
instigated a revolt of the Czechoslovak Corps. This corps, which consisted 
of prisoners of war, had received permission from the Soviet Government 
to return home through Siberia and the Far East. But on the 
way it was used by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and by the British and 
French for a revolt against the Soviet Government. The revolt of the 
corps served as a signal for a revolt of the kulaks in the Volga region 
and in Siberia, and of the workers of the Votkinsk and Izhevsk Works, 
who were under the influence of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. A Whiteguard-
Socialist-Revolutionary government was set up in the Volga 
region, in Samara, and a Whiteguard government of Siberia, in Omsk. 
Germany took no part in the intervention of this British-French- 
Japanese-American bloc; nor could she do so, since she was at war with 
this bloc if for no other reason. But in spite of this, and notwithstanding 
the existence of a peace treaty between Russia and Germany, 
no Bolshevik doubted that Kaiser Wilhelm¹s government was just as 
rabid an enemy of Soviet Russia as the British-French-Japanese-American 
invaders. And, indeed, the German imperialists did their utmost 
to isolate, weaken and destroy Soviet Russia. They snatched from it 
the Ukrainetrue, it was in accordance with a ³treaty² with the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 228 
Whiteguard Ukrainian Rada (Council)brought in their troops at 
the request of the Rada and began mercilessly to rob and oppress the 
Ukrainian people, forbidding them to maintain any connections whatever 
with Soviet Russia. They severed Transcaucasia from Soviet Russia, 
sent German and Turkish troops there at the request of the Georgian 
and Azerbaidjan nationalists and began to play the masters in Tiflis and 
in Baku. They supplied, not openly, it is true, abundant arms and 
provisions to General Krasnov, who had raised a revolt against the Soviet 
Government on the Don. 
Soviet Russia was thus cut off from her principal sources of food, 
raw material and fuel. 
Conditions were hard in Soviet Russia at that period. There was 
a shortage of bread and meat. The workers were starving. In Moscow 
and Petrograd a bread ration of one-eighth of a pound was issued to them 
every other day, and there were times when no bread was issued at all. 
The factories were at a standstill, or almost at a standstill, owing to a lack 
of raw materials and fuel. But the working class did not lose heart. Nor 
did the Bolshevik Party. The desperate struggle waged to overcome the 
incredible difficulties of that period showed how inexhaustible is the energy 
latent in the working class and how immense the prestige of the Bolshevik 
Party. 
The Party proclaimed the country an armed camp and placed its 
economic, cultural and political life on a war footing. The Soviet Government 
announced that ³the Socialist fatherland is in danger,² and called 
upon the people to rise in its defence. Lenin issued the slogan, ³All for 
the front!²and hundreds of thousands of workers and peasants 
volunteered for service in the Red Army and left for the front. About 
half the membership of the Party and of the Young Communist League 
went to the front. The Party roused the people for a war for the 
fatherland, a war against the foreign invaders and against the revolts of 
the exploiting classes whom the revolution had overthrown. The Council 
of Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Defence, organized by Lenin, directed the 
work of supplying the front with reinforcements, food, clothing and 
arms. The substitution of compulsory military service for the volunteer 
system brought hundreds of thousands of new recruits into the Red 
Army and very shortly raised its strength to over a million men. 
Although the country was in a difficult position, and the young 
Red Army was not yet consolidated, the measures of defence adopted 
soon yielded their first fruits. General Krasnov was forced back from 
Tsaritsyn, whose capture he had regarded as certain, and driven beyond 
the River Don. General Denikin¹s operations were localized within a

229 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
small area in the North Caucasus, while General Kornilov was killed 
in action against the Red Army. The Czechoslovaks and the Whiteguard-
Socialist-Revolutionary bands were ousted from Kazan, Simbirsk 
and Samara and driven to the Urals. A revolt in Yaroslavl headed 
by the Whiteguard Savinkov and organized by Lockhart, chief of the 
British Mission in Moscow, was suppressed, and Lockhart himself arrested. 
The Socialist-Revolutionaries, who had assassinated Comrades 
Uritsky and Volodarsky and had made a villainous attempt on the life 
of Lenin, were subjected to a Red terror in retaliation for their White 
terror against the Bolsheviks, and were completely routed in every 
important city in Central Russia. 
The young Red Army matured and hardened in battle. 
The work of the Communist Commissars was of decisive importance 
in the consolidation and political education of the Red Army and in 
raising its discipline and fighting efficiency. 
But the Bolshevik Party knew that these were only the first, not the 
decisive successes of the Red Army. It was aware that new and far 
more serious battles were still to come, and that the country could recover 
the lost food, raw material and fuel regions only by a prolonged 
and stubborn struggle with the enemy. The Bolsheviks therefore undertook 
intense preparations for a protracted war and decided to place the 
whole country at the service of the front. The Soviet Government introduced 
War Communism. It took under its control the middle-sized and 
small industries, in addition to large-scale industry, so as to accumulate 
goods for the supply of the army and the agricultural population. It introduced 
a state monopoly of the grain trade, prohibited private trading in 
grain and established the surplus-appropriation system, under which all 
surplus produce in the hands of the peasants was to be registered and acquired 
by the state at fixed prices, so as to accumulate stores of grain for 
the provisioning of the army and the workers. Lastly, it introduced universal 
labour service for all classes. By making physical labour compulsory 
for the bourgeoisie and thus releasing workers for other duties of greater 
importance to the front, the Party was giving practical effect to the 
principle: ³He who does not work, neither shall he eat.² 
All these measures, which were necessitated by the exceptionally 
difficult conditions of national defence, and bore a temporary character, 
were in their entirety known as War Communism. 
The country prepared itself for a long and exacting civil war, for 
a war against the foreign and internal enemies of the Soviet power. By 
the end of 1918 it had to increase the strength of the army threefold, 
and to accumulate supplies for this army.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 230
Lenin said at that time: 
³We had decided to have an army of one million men by the 
spring; now we need an army of three million. We can get it. And 
we will get it.² 
2. DEFEAT OF GERMANY IN THE WAR. REVOLUTION IN GERMANY. 
FOUNDING OF THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL. EIGHTH 
PARTY CONGRESS 
While the Soviet country was preparing for new battles against the 
forces of foreign intervention, in the West decisive events were taking 
place in the belligerent countries, both on the war fronts and in their 
interior. Germany and Austria were suffocating in the grip of war and 
a food crisis. Whereas Great Britain, France and the United States 
were continually drawing upon new resources, Germany and Austria 
were consuming their last meagre stocks. The situation was such that 
Germany and Austria, having reached the stage of extreme exhaustion, 
were on the brink of defeat. 
At the same time, the peoples of Germany and Austria were seething 
with indignation against the disastrous and interminable war, and 
against their imperialist governments who had reduced them to a state 
of exhaustion and starvation. The revolutionary influence of the October 
Revolution also had a tremendous effect, as did the fraternization 
of the Soviet soldiers with the Austrian and German soldiers at the 
front even before the Peace of Brest-Litovsk, the actual termination of 
the war with Soviet Russia and the conclusion of peace with her. The 
people of Russia had brought about the end of the detested war by overthrowing 
their imperialist government, and this could not but serve as 
an object lesson to the Austrian and German workers. And the German 
soldiers who had been stationed on the Eastern front and who after 
the Peace of Brest-Litovsk were transferred to the Western front could 
not but undermine the morale of the German army on that front by 
their accounts of the fraternization with the Soviet soldiers and of the 
way the Soviet soldiers had got rid of the war. The disintegration of the 
Austrian army from the same causes had begun even earlier. 
All this served to accentuate the craving for peace among the German 
soldiers; they lost their former fighting efficiency and began to retreat 
in face of the onslaught of the Entente armies. In November 1918 a 
revolution broke out in Germany, and Wilhelm and his government 
were overthrown.

231 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
Germany was obliged to acknowledge defeat and to sue for peace. 
Thus at one stroke Germany was reduced from a first-rate power 
to a second-rate power. 
As far as the position of the Soviet Government was concerned, 
this circumstance had certain disadvantages, inasmuch as it made the 
Entente countries, which had started armed intervention against the 
Soviet power, the dominant force in Europe and Asia, and enabled them 
to intervene more actively in the Soviet country and to blockade her, to 
draw the noose more tightly around the Soviet power. And this was 
what actually happened, as we shall see later. On the other hand, it had 
its advantages, which outweighed the disadvantages and fundamentally 
improved the position of Soviet Russia. In the first place, the Soviet 
Government was now able to annul the predatory Peace of Brest-Litovsk, 
to stop paying the indemnities, and to start an open struggle, 
military and political, for the liberation of Esthonia, Latvia, Byelorussia, 
Lithuania, the Ukraine and Transcaucasia from the yoke of German 
imperialism. Secondly, and chiefly, the existence in the centre of Europe, 
in Germany, of a republican regime and of Soviets of Workers¹ and 
Soldiers¹ Deputies was bound to revolutionize, and actually did revolutionize, 
the countries of Europe, and this could not but strengthen the 
position of the Soviet power in Russia. True, the revolution in Germany 
was not a Socialist but a bourgeois revolution, and the Soviets were 
an obedient tool of the bourgeois parliament, for they were dominated 
by the Social-Democrats, who were compromisers of the type of 
the Russian Mensheviks. This in fact explains the weakness of the German 
revolution. How weak it really was is shown, for example, by the 
fact that it allowed the German Whiteguards to assassinate such prominent 
revolutionaries as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht with 
impunity. Nevertheless, it was a revolution: Wilhelm had been overthrown, 
and the workers had cast off their chains; and this in itself 
was bound to unloose the revolution in the West, was bound to call forth 
a rise in the revolution in the European countries. 
The tide of revolution in Europe began to mount. A revolutionary 
movement started in Austria, and a Soviet Republic arose in Hungary. 
With the rising tide of the revolution Communist parties came to the 
surface. 
A real basis now existed for a union of the Communist parties, for 
the formation of the Third, Communist International. 
In March 1919, on the initiative of the Bolsheviks, headed by Lenin, 
the First Congress of the Communist Parties of various countries, held in 
Moscow, founded the Communist International. Although many of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 232 
the delegates were prevented by the blockade and imperialist persecution 
from arriving in Moscow, the most important countries of Europe and 
America were represented at this First Congress. The work of the 
congress was guided by Lenin. 
Lenin reported on the subject of bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. He brought out the importance of the Soviet 
system, showing that it meant genuine democracy for the working people. 
The congress adopted a manifesto to the proletariat of all countries 
calling upon them to wage a determined struggle for the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and for the triumph of Soviets all over the world. 
The congress set up an Executive Committee of the Third, Communist 
International (E.C.C.I.). 
Thus was founded an international revolutionary proletarian organization 
of a new typethe Communist Internationalthe Marxist- 
Leninist International. 
The Eighth Congress of our Party met in March 1919. It assembled 
in the midst of a conflict of contradictory factorson the one hand, the 
reactionary bloc of the Entente countries against the Soviet Government 
had grown stronger, and, on the other, the rising tide of revolution 
in Europe, especially in the defeated countries, had considerably improved 
the position of the Soviet country. 
The congress was attended by 301 delegates with vote, representing 
313,766 members of the Party, and 102 delegates with voice but no vote. 
In his inaugural speech, Lenin paid homage to the memory of Y. M. 
Sverdlov, one of the finest organizing talents in the Bolshevik Party, 
who had died on the eve of the congress. 
The congress adopted a new Party Program. This program gives 
a description of capitalism and of its highest phaseimperialism. It compares 
two systems of statethe bourgeois-democratic system and the 
Soviet system. It details the specific tasks of the Party in the struggle 
for Socialism: completion of the expropriation of the bourgeoisie; administration 
of the economic life of the country in accordance with a single 
Socialist plan; participation of the trade unions in the organization of the 
national economy; Socialist labour discipline; utilization of bourgeois 
experts in the economic field under the control of Soviet bodies; gradual 
and systematic enlistment of the middle peasantry in the work of Socialist 
construction. 
The congress adopted Lenin¹s proposal to include in the program 
in addition to a definition of imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism,

contained in the old program adopted at the Second Party Con

gress. Lenin considered it essential that the program should take account 
of the complexity of our economic system and note the existence of diverse 
economic formations in the country, including small commodity 
production, as represented by the middle peasants. Therefore, during the 
debate on the program, Lenin vigorously condemned the anti-Bolshevik 
views of Bukharin, who proposed that the clauses dealing with capitalism, 
small commodity production, the economy of the middle peasant, be left 
out of the program. Bukharin¹s views represented a Menshevik-Trotskyite 
denial of the role played by the middle peasant in the development of 
the Soviet state. Furthermore, Bukharin glossed over the fact that 
the small commodity production of the peasants bred and nourished kulak 
elements. 
Lenin further refuted the anti-Bolshevik views of Bukharin and 
Pyatakov on the national question. They spoke against the inclusion in 
the program of a clause on the right of nations to self-determination; 
they were against the equality of nations, claiming that it was a slogan 
that would hinder the, victory of the proletarian revolution and the 
union of the proletarians of different nationalities. Lenin overthrew 
these utterly pernicious, imperialist, chauvinist views of Bukharin and 
Pyatakov. 
An important place in the deliberations of the Eighth Congress was 
devoted to policy towards the middle peasants. The Decree on the 
Land had resulted in a steady growth in the number of middle peasants, 
who now comprised the majority of the peasant population. The attitude 
and conduct of the middle peasantry, which vacillated between the bourgeoisie 
and the proletariat, was of momentous importance for the fate of 
the Civil War and Socialist construction. The outcome of the Civil War 
largely depended on which way the middle peasant would swing, which 
class would win his allegiancethe proletariat or the bourgeoisie. The 
Czechoslovaks, the Whiteguards, the kulaks, the Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and the Mensheviks were able to overthrow the Soviet power in the Volga 
region in the summer of 1918 because they were supported by a large 
section of the middle peasantry. The same was true during the revolts 
raised by the kulaks in Central Russia. But in the autumn of 1918 the 
mass of the middle peasants began to swing over to the Soviet power. 
The peasants saw that victories of the Whites were followed by the 
restoration of the power of the landlords, the seizure of peasants¹ land, 
and the robbery, flogging and torture of peasants. The activities of the 
Committees of the Poor Peasants, which crushed the kulaks, also contributed 
to the change in the attitude of the peasantry. Accordingly, in 
November 1918, Lenin issued the slogan:

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 234 
³Learn to come to an agreement with the middle peasant, while 
not for a moment renouncing the struggle against the kulak and at 
the same time firmly relying solely on the poor peasant.² (Lenin, 
Selected Works, Vol. VIII, p. 150.) 
Of course, the middle peasants did not cease to vacillate entirely, 
but they drew closer to the Soviet Government and began to support it 
more solidly. This to a large extent was facilitated by the policy towards 
the middle peasants laid down by the Eighth Party Congress. 
The Eighth Congress marked a turning point in the policy of the 
Party towards the middle peasants. Lenin¹s report and the decisions of 
the congress laid down a new line of the Party on this question. The 
congress demanded that the Party organizations and all Communists 
should draw a strict distinction and division between the middle peasant 
and the kulak, and should strive to win the former over to the side of the 
working class by paying close attention to his needs. The backwardness 
of the middle peasants had to be overcome by persuasion and not by 
compulsion and coercion. The congress therefore gave instructions 
that no compulsion be used in the carrying out of Socialist measures in the 
countryside (formation of communes and agricultural artels). In all 
cases affecting the vital interests of the middle peasant, a practical agreement 
should be reached with him and concessions made with regard to 
the methods of realizing Socialist changes. The congress laid down the 
policy of a stable alliance with the middle peasant, the leading role in this 
alliance to be maintained by the proletariat. 
The new policy towards the middle peasant proclaimed by Lenin at 
the Eighth Congress required that the proletariat should rely on the poor 
peasant, maintain a stable alliance with the middle peasant and fight the 
kulak. The policy of the Party before the Eighth Congress was in general 
one of neutralizing the middle peasant. This meant that the Party 
strove to prevent the middle peasant from siding with the kulak and with 
the bourgeoisie in general. But now this was not enough. The Eighth 
Congress passed from a policy of neutralization of the middle peasant 
to a policy of stable alliance with him for the purpose of the struggle 
against the Whiteguards and foreign intervention and for the successful 
building of Socialism. 
The policy adopted by the congress towards the middle peasants, 
who formed the bulk of the peasantry, played a decisive part in ensuring 
success in the Civil War against foreign intervention and its Whiteguard 
henchmen. In the autumn of 1919, when the peasants had to choose 
between the Soviet power and Denikin, they supported the Soviets, and 
the proletarian dictatorship was able to vanquish its most dangerous enemy.

235 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
The problems connected with the building up of the Red Army 
held a special place in the deliberations of the congress, where the socalled 
³Military Opposition² appeared in the field. This ³Military Opposition² 
comprised quite a number of former members of the now shattered 
group of ³Left Communists²; but it also included some Party workers 
who had never participated in any opposition, but were dissatisfied with 
the way Trotsky was conducting the affairs of the army. The majority 
of the delegates from the army were distinctly hostile to Trotsky; they 
resented his veneration for the military experts of the old tsarist army, 
some of whom were betraying us outright in the Civil War, and his 
arrogant and hostile attitude towards the old Bolshevik cadres in the 
army. Instances of Trotsky¹s ³practices² were cited at the congress. 
For example, he had attempted to shoot a number of prominent army 
Communists serving at the front, just because they had incurred his displeasure. 
This was directly playing into the hands of the enemy. It was 
only the intervention of the Central Committee and the protests of 
military men that saved the lives of these comrades. 
But while fighting Trotsky¹s distortions of the military policy of the 
Party, the ³Military Opposition² held incorrect views on a number of 
points concerning the building up of the army. Lenin and Stalin vigorously 
came out against the ³Military Opposition,² because the latter defended 
the survivals of the guerrilla spirit and resisted the creation of a regular 
Red Army, the utilization of the military experts of the old army and 
the establishment of that iron discipline without which no army can be 
a real army. Comrade Stalin rebutted the ³Military Opposition² and 
demanded the creation of a regular army inspired with the spirit of strictest 
discipline. 
He said: 
³Either we create a real worker and peasantprimarily a peasant
army, strictly disciplined army, and defend the Republic, or we 
perish.² 
While rejecting a number of proposals made by the ³Military Opposition,² 
the congress dealt a blow at Trotsky by demanding an improvement 
in the work of the central military institutions and the enhancement 
of the role of the Communists in the army. 
A Military Commission was set up at the congress; thanks to its 
efforts the decision on the military question was adopted by the congress 
unanimously. 
The effect of this decision was to strengthen the Red Army and to 
bring it still closer to the Party.

The congress further discussed Party and Soviet affairs and the 
guiding role of the Party in the Soviets. During the debate on the 
latter question the congress repudiated the view of the opportunist 
Sapronov-Ossinsky group which held that the Party should not guide the 
work of the Soviets. 
Lastly, in view of the huge influx of new members into the Party, 
the congress outlined measures to improve the social composition of the 
Party and decided to conduct a re-registration of its members. 
This initiated the first purge of the Party ranks. 
3. EXTENSION OF INTERVENTION. BLOCKADE OF THE SOVIET 
COUNTRY. KOLCHAK¹S CAMPAIGN AND DEFEAT. DENIKIN¹S 
CAMPAIGN AND DEFEAT. A THREE-MONTHS¹ RESPITE. NINTH 
PARTY CONGRESS 
Having vanquished Germany and Austria, the Entente states decided 
to hurl large military forces against the Soviet country. After Germany¹s 
defeat and the evacuation of her troops from the Ukraine and Transcaucasia, 
her place was taken by the British and French, who dispatched 
their fleets to the Black Sea and landed troops in Odessa and in Transcaucasia. 
Such was the brutality of the Entente forces of intervention 
that they did not hesitate to shoot whole batches of workers and peasants 
in the occupied regions. Their outrages reached such lengths in the end 
that after the occupation of Turkestan they carried off to the Transcaspian 
region twenty-six leading Baku Bolsheviksincluding Comrades 
Shaumyan, Fioletov, Djaparidze, Malygin, Azizbekov, Korganovand 
with the aid of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, had them brutally shot. 
The interventionists soon proclaimed a blockade of Russia. All sea 
routes and other lines of communication with the external world were cut. 
The Soviet country was surrounded on nearly every side. 
The Entente countries placed their chief hopes in Admiral Kolchak, 
their puppet in Omsk, Siberia. He was proclaimed ³supreme ruler of 
Russia² and all the counter-revolutionary forces in the country placed 
themselves under his command. 
The Eastern Front thus became the main front. 
Kolchak assembled a huge army and in the spring of 1919 almost 
reached the Volga. The finest Bolshevik forces were hurled against him; 
Young Communist Leaguers and workers were mobilized. In April 
1919, Kolchak¹s army met with severe defeat at the hands of the Red 
Army and very soon began to retreat along the whole front. 
At the height of the advance of the Red Army on the Eastern Front, 
Trotsky put forward a suspicious plan: he proposed that the advance

237 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
should be halted before it reached the Urals, the pursuit of Kolchak¹s 
army discontinued, and troops transferred from the Eastern Front to 
the Southern Front. The Central Committee of the Party fully realized 
that the Urals and Siberia could not be left in Kolchak¹s hands, for there, 
with the aid of the Japanese and British, he might recuperate and retrieve 
his former position. It therefore rejected this plan and gave instructions 
to proceed with the advance. Trotsky disagreed with these instructions 
and tendered his resignation, which the Central Committee declined, 
at the same time ordering him to refrain at once from all participation 
in the direction of the operations on the Eastern Front. The Red 
Army pursued its offensive against Kolchak with greater vigour than 
ever; it inflicted a number of new defeats on him and freed of the 
Whites the Urals and Siberia, where the Red Army was supported by a 
powerful partisan movement in the Whites¹ rear. 
In the summer of 1919, the imperialists assigned to General Yudenich, 
who headed the counter-revolutionaries in the north-west (in the 
Baltic countries, in the vicinity of Petrograd), the task of diverting the 
attention of the Red Army from the Eastern Front by an attack on 
Petrograd. Influenced by the counter-revolutionary agitation of former 
officers, the garrisons of two forts in the vicinity of Petrograd mutinied 
against the Soviet Government. At the same time a counter-revolutionary 
plot was discovered at the Front Headquarters. The enemy threatened 
Petrograd. But thanks to the measures taken by the Soviet Government 
with the support of the workers and sailors, the mutinous forts were 
cleared of Whites, and Yudenich¹s troops were defeated and driven back 
into Esthonia. 
The defeat of Yudenich near Petrograd made it easier to cope with 
Kolchak, and by the end of 1919 his army was completely routed. Kolchak 
himself was taken prisoner and shot by sentence of the Revolutionary 
Committee in Irkutsk. 
That was the end of Kolchak. 
The Siberians had a popular song about Kolchak at that time: 
³Uniform British, 
Epaulettes from France, 
Japanese tobacco, 
Kolchak leads the dance. 
Uniform in tatters, 
Epaulettes all gone, 
So is the tobacco, 
Kolchak¹s day is done.²

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 238
Since Kolchak had not justified their hopes, the interventionists altered 
their plan of attack on the Soviet Republic. The troops landed in Odessa 
had to be withdrawn, for contact with the army of the Soviet Republic 
had infected them with the revolutionary spirit and they were beginning 
to rebel against their imperialist masters. For example, there was the 
revolt of French sailors in Odessa led by André Marty. Accordingly, 
now that Kolchak had been defeated, the Entente centred its attention 
on General Denikin, Kornilov¹s confederate and the organizer of the 
³Volunteer Army.² Denikin at that time was operating against the 
Soviet Government in the south, in the Kuban region. The Entente 
supplied his army with large quantities of ammunition and equipment 
and sent it north against the Soviet Government. 
The Southern Front now became the chief front. 
Denikin began his main campaign against the Soviet Government 
in the summer of 1919. Trotsky had disrupted the Southern Front, 
and our troops suffered defeat after defeat. By the middle of October 
the Whites had seized the whole of the Ukraine, had captured Orel 
and were nearing Tula, which supplied our army with cartridges, rifles 
and machine-guns. The Whites were approaching Moscow. The situation 
of the Soviet Republic became grave in the extreme. The Party 
sounded the alarm and called upon the people to resist. Lenin issued the 
slogan, ³All for the fight against Denikin!² Inspired by the Bolsheviks, 
the workers and peasants mustered all their forces to smash the 
enemy. 
The Central Committee sent Comrades Stalin, Voroshilov, Ordjonikidze 
and Budyonny to the Southern Front to prepare the rout of Denikin. 
Trotsky was removed from the direction of the operations of the Red 
Army in the south. Before Comrade Stalin¹s arrival, the Command of 
the Southern Front, in conjunction with Trotsky, had drawn up a plan 
to strike the main blow at Denikin from Tsaritsyn in the direction of 
Novorossisk, through the Don Steppe, where there were no roads and 
where the Red Army would have to pass through regions inhabited by 
Cossacks, who were at that time largely under the influence of the 
Whiteguards. Comrade Stalin severely criticized this plan and submitted 
to the Central Committee his own plan for the defeat of Denikin. According 
to this plan the main blow was to be delivered by way of Kharkov-
Donetz Basin-Rostov. This plan would ensure the rapid advance 
of our troops against Denikin, for they would be moving through working 
class and peasant regions where they would have the open sympathy 
of the population. Furthermore, the dense network of railway lines in 
this region would ensure our armies the regular supply of all they required.

239 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
Lastly, this plan would make it possible to release the Donetz Coal Basin 
and thus supply our country with fuel. 
The Central Committee of the Party accepted Comrade Stalin¹s 
plan. In the second half of October 1919, after fierce resistance, Denikin 
was defeated by the Red Army in the decisive battles of Orel and 
Voronezh. He began a rapid retreat, and, pursued by our forces, fled to 
the south. At the beginning of 1920 the whole of the Ukraine and the 
North Caucasus had been cleared of Whites. 
During the decisive battles on the Southern Front, the imperialists 
again hurled Yudenich¹s corps against Petrograd in order to divert our 
forces from the south and thus improve the position of Denikin¹s army. 
The Whites approached the very gates of Petrograd. The heroic proletariat 
of the premier city of the revolution rose in a solid wall for its 
defence. The Communists, as always, were in the vanguard. After 
fierce fighting, the Whites were defeated and again flung beyond our 
borders back into Esthonia. 
And that was the end of Denikin. 
The defeat of Kolchak and Denikin was followed by a brief respite. 
When the imperialists saw that the Whiteguard armies had been 
smashed, that intervention had failed, and that the Soviet Government 
was consolidating its position all over the country, while in Western 
Europe the indignation of the workers against military intervention in 
the Soviet Republic was rising, they began to change their attitude towards 
the Soviet state. In January 1920, Great Britain, France, and Italy 
decided to call off the blockade of Soviet Russia. 
This was an important breach in the wall of intervention. 
It did not, of course, mean that the Soviet country was done with 
intervention and the Civil War. There was still the danger of attack by 
imperialist Poland. The forces of intervention had not yet been finally 
driven out of the Far East, Transcaucasia and the Crimea. But Soviet 
Russia had secured a temporary breathing space and was able to divert 
more forces to economic development. The Party could now devote its 
attention to economic problems. 
During the Civil War many skilled workers had left industry owing 
to the closing down of mills and factories. The Party now took measures 
to return them to industry to work at their trades. The railways were 
in a grave condition and several thousand Communists were assigned 
to the work of restoring them, for unless this was done the restoration 
of the major branches of industry could not be seriously undertaken. 
The organization of the food supply was extended and improved. The 
drafting of a plan for the electrification of Russia was begun. Nearly

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 240 
five million Red Army men were under arms and could not be demobilized 
owing to the danger of war. A part of the Red Army was therefore 
converted into labour armies and used in the economic field. The Council 
of Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Defence was transformed into the Council of 
Labour and Defence, and a State Planning Commission (Gosplan) set 
up to assist it. 
Such was the situation when the Ninth Party Congress opened. 
The congress met at the end of March 1920. It was attended by 
554 delegates with vote, representing 611,978 Party members, and 162 
delegates with voice but no vote. 
The congress defined the immediate tasks of the country in the sphere 
of transportation and industry. It particularly stressed the necessity of 
the trade unions taking part in the building up of the economic life. 
Special attention was devoted by the congress to a single economic 
plan for the restoration, in the first place, of the railways, the fuel industry 
and the iron and steel industry. The major item in this plan was a 
project for the electrification of the country, which Lenin advanced as 
³a great program for the next ten or twenty years.² This formed the 
basis of the famous plan of the State Commission for the Electrification 
of Russia (GOELRO), the provisions of which have today been far 
exceeded. 
The congress rejected the views of an anti-Party group which called 
itself ³The Group of Democratic-Centralism² and was opposed to 
one-man management and the undivided responsibility of industrial directors. 
It advocated unrestricted ³group management² under which 
nobody would be personally responsible for the administration of industry. 
The chief figures in this anti-Party group were Sapronov, Ossinsky and 
Y. Smirnov. They were supported at the congress by Rykov and Tomsky. 
4. POLISH GENTRY ATTACK SOVIET RUSSIA. GENERAL WRANGEL¹S 
CAMPAIGN. FAILURE OF THE POLISH PLAN. ROUT OF 
WRANGEL. END OF THE INTERVENTION. 
Notwithstanding the defeat of Kolchak and Denikin, notwithstanding the 
fact that the Soviet Republic was steadily regaining its territory by 
clearing the Whites and the forces of intervention out of the Northern 
Territory, Turkestan, Siberia, the Don region, the Ukraine, etc., notwithstanding 
the fact that the Entente states were obliged to call off 
the blockade of Russia, they still refused to reconcile themselves to the

241 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
idea that the Soviet power had proved impregnable and had come out 
victorious. They therefore resolved to make one more attempt at intervention 
in Soviet Russia. This time they decided to utilize both Pilsudski, 
a bourgeois counter-revolutionary nationalist, the virtual head of the 
Polish state, and General Wrangel, who had rallied the remnants of 
Denikin¹s army in the Crimea and from there was threatening the Donetz 
Basin and the Ukraine. 
The Polish gentry and Wrangel, as Lenin put it, were the two 
hands with which international imperialism attempted to strangle Soviet 
Russia. 
The plan of the Poles was to seize the Soviet Ukraine west of the 
Dnieper, to occupy Soviet Byelorussia, to restore the power of the Polish 
magnates in these regions, to extend the frontiers of the Polish state so 
that they stretched ³from sea to sea,² from Danzig to Odessa, and, in 
return for his aid, to help Wrangel smash the Red Army and restore 
the power of the landlords and capitalists in Soviet Russia. 
This plan was approved by the Entente states. 
The Soviet Government made vain attempts to enter into negotiations 
with Poland with the object of preserving peace and averting war. 
Pilsudski refused to discuss peace. He wanted war. He calculated that 
the Red Army, fatigued by its battles with Kolchak and Denikin, would 
not be able to withstand the attack of the Polish forces. 
The short breathing space had come to an end. 
In April 1920 the Poles invaded the Soviet Ukraine and seized Kiev. 
At the same time, Wrangel took the offensive and threatened the Donetz 
Basin. 
In reply, the Red Army started a counter-offensive against the 
Poles along the whole front. Kiev was recaptured and the Polish warlords 
driven out of the Ukraine and Byelorussia. The impetuous advance 
of the Red troops on the Southern Front brought them to the 
very gates of Lvov in Galicia, while the troops on the Western Front 
were nearing Warsaw. The Polish armies were on the verge of utter 
defeat. 
But success was frustrated by the suspicious actions of Trotsky and 
his followers at the General Headquarters of the Red Army. Through 
the fault of Trotsky and Tukhachevsky, the advance of the Red troops 
on the Western Front, towards Warsaw, proceeded in an absolutely 
unorganized manner: the troops were allowed no opportunity to consolidate 
the positions that they won, the advance detachments were led 
too far ahead, while reserves and ammunition were left too far in the rear. 
As a result, the advance detachments were left without ammuni

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 242 
tion and reserves and the front was stretched out endlessly. This made 
it easy to force a breach in the front. The result was that when a small 
force of Poles broke through our Western Front at one point, our 
troops, left without ammunition, were obliged to retreat. As regards 
the troops on the Southern Front, who had reached the gates of Lvov 
and were pressing the Poles hard, they were forbidden by Trotsky, 
that ill-famed ³chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council,² to 
capture Lvov. He ordered the transfer of the Mounted Army, the main 
force on the Southern Front, far to the north-east. This was done on 
the pretext of helping the Western Front, although it was not difficult 
to see that the best, and in fact only possible, way of helping the Western 
Front was to capture Lvov. But the withdrawal of the Mounted Army 
from the Southern Front, its departure from Lvov, virtually meant the 
retreat of our forces on the Southern Front as well. This wrecker¹s order 
issued by Trotsky thus forced upon our troops on the Southern Front an 
incomprehensible and absolutely unjustified retreatto the joy of the 
Polish gentry. 
This was giving direct assistance, indeednot to our Western Front, 
however, but to the Polish gentry and the Entente. 
Within a few days the advance of the Poles was checked and our 
troops began preparations for a new counter-offensive. But, unable to 
continue the war, and alarmed by the prospect of a Red counter-offensive, 
Poland was obliged to renounce her claims to the Ukrainian territory 
west of the Dnieper and to Byelorussia and preferred to conclude peace. 
On October 20, 1920, the Peace of Riga was signed. In accordance 
with this treaty Poland retained Galicia and part of Byelorussia. 
Having concluded peace with Poland, the Soviet Republic decided 
to put an end to Wrangel. The British and French had supplied him 
with guns, rifles, armoured cars, tanks, aeroplanes and ammunition of 
the latest type. He had Whiteguard shock regiments, mainly consisting 
of officers. But Wrangel failed to rally any considerable number of 
peasants and Cossacks in support of the troops he had landed in the Kuban 
and the Don regions. Nevertheless, he advanced to the very gates of the 
Donetz Basin, creating a menace to our coal region. The position of 
the Soviet Government at that time was further complicated by the fact 
that the Red Army was suffering greatly from fatigue. The troops 
were obliged to advance under extremely difficult conditions: while conducting 
an offensive against Wrangel, they had at the same time to 
smash Makhno¹s anarchist bands who were assisting Wrangel. But 
although Wrangel had the superiority in technical equipment, although 
the Red Army had no tanks, it drove Wrangel into the Crimean Penin

243 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
sula and there bottled him up. In November 1920 the Red forces captured 
the fortified position of Perekop, swept into the Crimea, smashed 
Wrangel¹s forces and cleared the Peninsula of the Whiteguards and the 
forces of intervention. The Crimea became Soviet territory. 
The failure of Poland¹s imperialist plans and the defeat of Wrangel 
ended the period of intervention. 
At the end of 1920 there began the liberation of Transcaucasia: 
Azerbaidjan was freed from the yoke of the bourgeois nationalist Mussavatists, 
Georgia from the Menshevik nationalists, and Armenia from the 
Dashnaks. The Soviet power triumphed in Azerbaidjan, Armenia and 
Georgia. 
This did not yet mean the end of all intervention. That of the 
Japanese in the Far East lasted until 1922. Moreover, new attempts 
at intervention were made (Ataman Semyonov and Baron Ungern in 
the East, the Finnish Whites in Karelia in 1921). But the principal 
enemies of the Soviet country, the principal forces of intervention, were 
shattered by the end of 1920. 
The war of the foreign interventionists and the Russian Whiteguards 
against the Soviets ended in a victory for the Soviets. 
The Soviet Republic preserved its independence and freedom. 
This was the end of foreign military intervention and Civil War. 
This was a historic victory for the Soviet power. 
5. HOW AND WHY THE SOVIET REPUBLIC DEFEATED THE COMBINED 
FORCES OF BRITISH-FRENCH-JAPANESE-POLISH INTERVENTION 
AND OF THE BOURGEOIS-LANDLORD-WHITEGUARD 
COUNTER-REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA 
If we study the leading European and American newspapers and 
periodicals of the period of intervention, we shall easily find that there 
was not a single prominent writer, military or civilian, not a single 
military expert who believed that the Soviet Government could win. On 
the contrary, all prominent writers, military experts and historians of 
revolution of all countries and nations, all the so-called savants, were 
unanimous in declaring that the days of the Soviets were numbered, that 
their defeat was inevitable. 
They based their certainty of the victory of the forces of intervention 
on the fact that whereas Soviet Russia had no organized army and had to 
create its Red Army under fire, so to speak, the interventionists and 
Whiteguards did have an army more or less ready to hand.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 244
Further, they based their certainty on the fact that the Red Army 
had no experienced military men, the majority of them having gone over 
to the counter-revolution, whereas the interventionists and Whiteguards 
did have such men. 
Furthermore, they based their certainty on the fact that, owing to 
the backwardness of Russia¹s war industry, the Red Army was suffering 
from a shortage of arms and ammunition; that what it did have was 
of poor quality, while it could not obtain supplies from abroad because 
Russia was hermetically sealed on all sides by the blockade. The army 
of the interventionists and Whiteguards, on the other hand, was abundantly 
supplied, and would continue to be supplied, with first-class arms, 
ammunition and equipment. 
Lastly, they based their certainty on the fact that the army of the 
interventionists and Whiteguards occupied the richest food-producing 
regions of Russia, whereas the Red Army had no such regions and was 
suffering from a shortage of provisions. 
And it was a fact that the Red Army did suffer from all these handicaps 
and deficiencies. 
In this respectbut only in this respectthe gentlemen of the intervention 
were absolutely right. 
How then is it to be explained that the Red Army, although suffering 
from such grave shortcomings, was able to defeat the army of the interventionists 
and Whiteguards which did not suffer from such shortcomings? 
1. The Red Army was victorious because the Soviet Government¹s 
policy for which the Red Army was fighting was a right policy, one that 
corresponded to the interests of the people, and because the people understood 
and realized that it was the right policy, their own policy, and supported 
it unreservedly. 
The Bolsheviks knew that an army that fights for a wrong policy, 
for a policy that is not supported by the people, cannot win. The army 
of the interventionists and Whiteguards was such an army. It had 
everything: experienced commanders and first-class arms, ammunition, 
equipment and provisions. It lacked only one thingthe support and 
sympathy of the peoples of Russia; for the peoples of Russia could not 
and would not support the policy of the interventionists and Whiteguard 
³rulers² because it was a policy hostile to the people. And so the interventionist 
and Whiteguard army was defeated. 
2. The Red Army was victorious because it was absolutely loyal and 
faithful to its people, for which reason the people loved and supported it 
and looked upon it as their own army. The Red Army is the offspring 
of the people, and if it is faithful to its people, as a true son is to his

245 1 9 1 8 - 1 9 2 0 
mother, it will have the support of the people and is bound to win. An 
army, however, that goes against its people must suffer defeat. 
3. The Red Army was victorious because the Soviet Government 
was able to muster the whole rear, the whole country, to serve the needs 
of the front. An army without a strong rear to support the front in 
every way is doomed to defeat. The Bolsheviks knew this and that is 
why they converted the country into an armed camp to supply the front 
with arms, ammunition, equipment, food and reinforcements. 
4. The Red Army was victorious because: a) the Red Army men 
understood the aims and purposes of the war and recognized their justice; 
b) the recognition of the justice of the aims and purposes of the 
war strengthened their discipline and fighting efficiency; and c) as a 
result, the Red Army throughout displayed unparalleled self-sacrifice and 
unexampled mass heroism in battle against the enemy. 
5. The Red Army was victorious because its leading core, both at 
the front and in the rear, was the Bolshevik Party, united in its solidarity 
and discipline, strong in its revolutionary spirit and readiness for any 
sacrifice in the common cause, and unsurpassed in its ability to organize 
millions and to lead them properly in complex situations. 
³It is only because of the Party¹s vigilance and its strict discipline,² 
said Lenin, ³because the authority of the Party united all government 
departments and institutions, because the slogans issued by the Central 
Committee were followed by tens, hundreds, thousands and finally 
millions of people as one man, because incredible sacrifices were made, 
that the miracle took place and we were able to win, in spite of repeated 
campaigns of the imperialists of the Entente and of the whole 
world.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXV, p. 96.) 
6. The Red Army was victorious because: a) it was able to produce from 
its own ranks military commanders of a new type, men like Frunze, 
Voroshilov, Budyonny, and others; b) in its ranks fought such talented 
heroes who came from the people as Kotovsky, Chapayev, Lazo, Shchors, 
Parkhomenko, and many others; c) the political education of the Red 
Army was in the hands of men like Lenin, Stalin, Molotov, Kalinin, 
Sverdlov, Kaganovich, Ordjonikidze, Kirov, Kuibyshev, Mikoyan, 
Zhdanov, Andreyev, Petrovsky, Yaroslavsky, Yezhov, Dzerzhinsky, 
Shchadenko, Mekhlis, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Shkiryatov, and others; d) 
the Red Army possessed such outstanding organizers and agitators as the 
military commissars, who by their work cemented the ranks of the Red 
Army men, fostered in them the spirit of discipline and military daring,

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 246 
and energeticallyswiftly and relentlesslycut short the treacherous activities 
of certain of the commanders, while on the other hand, they 
boldly and resolutely supported the prestige and renown of commanders, 
Party and non-Party, who had proved their loyalty to the Soviet power 
and who were capable of leading the Red Army units with a firm hand. 
³Without the military commissars we would not have had a Red 
Army,² Lenin said. 
7. The Red Army was victorious because in the rear of the White 
armies, in the rear of Kolchak, Denikin, Krasnov and Wrangel, there 
secretly operated splendid Bolsheviks, Party and non-Party, who raised 
the workers and peasants in revolt against the invaders, against the Whiteguards, 
undermined the rear of the foes of the Soviet Government, and 
thereby facilitated the advance of the Red Army. Everybody knows 
that the partisans of the Ukraine, Siberia, the Far East, the Urals, Byelorussia 
and the Volga region, by undermining the rear of the Whiteguards 
and the invaders, rendered invaluable service to the Red Army. 
8. The Red Army was victorious because the Soviet Republic was 
not alone in its struggle against Whiteguard counter-revolution and foreign 
intervention, because the struggle of the Soviet Government and its 
successes enlisted the sympathy and support of the proletarians of the 
whole world. While the imperialists were trying to stifle the Soviet Republic 
by intervention and blockade, the workers of the imperialist countries 
sided with the Soviets and helped them. Their struggle against the 
capitalists of the countries hostile to the Soviet Republic helped in the 
end to force the imperialists to call off the intervention. The workers 
of Great Britain, France and the other intervening powers called strikes, 
refused to load munitions consigned to the invaders and the Whiteguard 
generals, and set up Councils of Action whose work was guided 
by the slogan³Hands off Russia!² 
³The international bourgeoisie has only to raise its hand against 
us to have it seized by its own workers,² Lenin said. (Ibid., p. 405.) 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
Vanquished by the October Revolution, the landlords and capitalists, 
in conjunction with the Whiteguard generals, conspired with the governments 
of the Entente countries against the interests of their own 
country for a joint armed attack on the Soviet land and for the overthrow 
of the Soviet Government. This formed the basis of the military intervention 
of the Entente and of the Whiteguard revolts in the border

regions of Russia, as a result of which Russia was cut off from her 
sources of food and raw material. 
The military defeat of Germany and the termination of the war between 
the two imperialist coalitions in Europe served to strengthen the 
Entente and to intensify the intervention, and created new difficulties 
for Soviet Russia. 
On the other hand, the revolution in Germany and the incipient 
revolutionary movement in the European countries created favourable 
international conditions for the Soviet power and relieved the position 
of the Soviet Republic. 
The Bolshevik Party roused the workers and peasants for a war 
for the fatherland, a war against the foreign invaders and the bourgeois 
and landlord Whiteguards. The Soviet Republic and its Red Army 
defeated one after another the puppets of the EntenteKolchak, Yudenich, 
Denikin, Krasnov and Wrangel, drove out of the Ukraine and 
Byelorussia another puppet of the Entente, Pilsudski, and thus beat off 
the forces of foreign intervention and drove them out of the Soviet 
country. 
Thus the first armed attack of international capital on the land of 
Socialism ended in a complete fiasco. 
In the period of intervention, the parties which had been smashed by 
the revolution, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, Anarchists and 
nationalists, supported the Whiteguard generals and the invaders, hatched 
counter-revolutionary plots against the Soviet Republic and resorted to 
terrorism against Soviet leaders. These parties, which had enjoyed a 
certain amount of influence among the working class before the October 
Revolution, completely exposed themselves before the masses as counterrevolutionary 
parties during the Civil War. 
The period of Civil War and intervention witnessed the political collapse 
of these parties and the final triumph of the Communist Party in 
Soviet Russia.

THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY IN THE PERIOD 
OF TRANSITION TO THE PEACEFUL WORK 
OF ECONOMIC RESTORATION 
( 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 ) 
1. SOVIET REPUBLIC AFTER THE DEFEAT OF THE INTERVENTION 
AND END OF THE CIVIL WAR. DIFFICULTIES OF THE RESTORATION 
PERIOD 
Having ended the war, the Soviet Republic turned to the work of 
peaceful economic development. The wounds of war had to be healed. 
The shattered economic life of the country had to be rebuilt, its industry, 
railways and agriculture restored. 
B u t the work of peaceful development had to be undertaken in extremely 
difficult circumstances. The victory in the Civil War had not 
been an easy one. The country had been reduced to a state of ruin by 
four years of imperialist war and three years of war against the intervention. 
The gross output of agriculture in 1920 was only about one-half 
of the pre-war outputthat of the poverty-stricken Russian countryside 
of tsarist days. To make matters worse, in 1920 there was a harvest 
failure in many of the provinces. Agriculture was in sore straits. 
Even worse was the plight of industry, which was in a state of complete 
dislocation. The output of large-scale industry in 1920 was a little 
over one-seventh of pre-war. Most of the mills and factories were at 
a standstill; mines and collieries were wrecked and flooded. Gravest 
of all was the condition of the iron and steel industry. The total output 
of pig-iron in 1921 was only 116,300 tons, or about 3 per cent of the 
pre-war output. There was a shortage of fuel. Transport was disrupted. 
Stocks of metal and textiles in the country were nearly exhausted. There 
was an acute shortage of such prime necessities as bread, fats, meat, 
footwear, clothing, matches, salt, kerosene, and soap. 
While the war was on, people put up with the shortage and scarcity, 
and were sometimes even oblivious to it. But now that the war was 
over, they suddenly felt that this shortage and scarcity were intolerable 
and began to demand that they be immediately remedied. 
Discontent appeared among the peasants. The fire of the Civil War 
248

249 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
had welded and steeled a military and political alliance of the working 
class and the peasantry. This alliance rested on a definite basis: the peasants 
received from the Soviet Government land and protection against 
the landlords and kulaks; the workers received from the peasantry foodstuffs 
under the surplus-appropriation system. 
Now this basis was no longer adequate. 
The Soviet state had been compelled to appropriate all surplus produce 
from the peasants for the needs of national defence. Victory in the 
Civil War would have been impossible without the surplus-appropriation 
system, without the policy of War Communism. This policy was necessitated 
by the war and intervention. As long as the war was on, the 
peasantry had acquiesced in the surplus-appropriation system and had paid 
no heed to the shortage of commodities; but when the war ended and 
there was no longer any danger of the landlords returning, the peasants 
began to express dissatisfaction with having to surrender all their surpluses, 
with the surplus-appropriation system, and to demand a sufficient 
supply of commodities. 
As Lenin pointed out, the whole system of War Communism had 
come into collision with the interests of the peasantry. 
The spirit of discontent affected the working class as well. The 
proletariat had borne the brunt of the Civil War, had heroically and 
self-sacrificingly fought the Whiteguard and foreign hordes, and the 
ravages of economic disruption and famine. The best, the most classconscious, 
self-sacrificing and disciplined workers were inspired by Socialist 
enthusiasm. But the utter economic disruption had its influence 
on the working class, too. The few factories and plants still in operation 
were working spasmodically. The workers were reduced to doing odd 
jobs for a living, making cigarette lighters and engaging in petty bartering 
for food in the villages (³bag-trading²). The class basis of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat was being weakened; the workers were 
scattering, decamping for the villages, ceasing to be workers and becoming 
declassed. Some of the workers were beginning to show signs of 
discontent owing to hunger and weariness. 
The Party was confronted with the necessity of working out a new 
line of policy on all questions affecting the economic life of the country, 
a line that would meet the new situation. 
And the Party proceeded to work out such a line of policy on questions 
of economic development. 
But the class enemy was not dozing. He tried to exploit the distressing 
economic situation and the discontent of the peasants for his own 
purposes. Kulak revolts, engineered by Whiteguards and Socialist-Rev

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 250 
olutionaries, broke out in Siberia, the Ukraine and the Tambov province 
(Antonov¹s rebellion). All kinds of counter-revolutionary elements 
Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Anarchists, Whiteguards, bourgeois 
nationalistsbecame active again. The enemy adopted new tactics 
of struggle against the Soviet power. He began to borrow a Soviet garb, 
and his slogan was no longer the old bankrupt ³Down with the Soviets!² 
but a new slogan: ³For the Soviets, but without Communists!² 
A glaring instance of the new tactics of the class enemy was the 
counter-revolutionary mutiny in Kronstadt. It began in March 1921, 
a week before the Tenth Party Congress. Whiteguards, in complicity 
with Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and representatives of foreign 
states, assumed the lead of the mutiny. The mutineers at first used a 
³Soviet² signboard to camouflage their purpose of restoring the power 
and property of the capitalists and landlords. They raised the cry: ³Soviets 
without Communists!² The counter-revolutionaries tried to exploit 
the discontent of the petty bourgeois masses in order to overthrow the 
power of the Soviets under a pseudo-Soviet slogan. 
Two circumstances facilitated the outbreak of the Kronstadt mutiny: 
the deterioration in the composition of the ships¹ crews, and the weakness 
of the Bolshevik organization in Kronstadt. Nearly all the old sailors 
who had taken part in the October Revolution were at the front, heroically 
fighting in the ranks of the Red Army. The naval replenishments 
consisted of new men, who had not been schooled in the revolution. 
These were a perfectly raw peasant mass who gave expression to the 
peasantry¹s discontent with the surplus-appropriation system. As for the 
Bolshevik organization in Kronstadt, it had been greatly weakened by 
a series of mobilizations for the front. This enabled the Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
Mensheviks and Whiteguards to worm their way into Kronstadt 
and to seize control of it. 
The mutineers gained possession of a first-class fortress, the fleet, 
and a vast quantity of arms and ammunition. The international counterrevolutionaries 
were triumphant. But their jubilation was premature. 
The mutiny was quickly put down by Soviet troops. Against the Kronstadt 
mutineers the Party sent its finest sonsdelegates to the Tenth 
Congress, headed by Comrade Voroshilov. The Red Army men advanced 
on Kronstadt across a thin sheet of ice; it broke in places and 
many were drowned. The almost impregnable forts of Kronstadt had 
to be taken by storm; but loyalty to the revolution, bravery and readiness 
to die for the Soviets won the day. The fortress of Kronstadt fell before 
the onslaught of the Red troops. The Kronstadt mutiny was suppressed.

2. PARTY DISCUSSION ON THE TRADE UNIONS. TENTH PARTY 
CONGRESS. DEFEAT OF THE OPPOSITION. ADOPTION OF THE 
NEW ECONOMIC POLICY ( NEP ) 
The Central Committee of the Party, its Leninist majority, saw 
clearly that now that the war was over and the country had turned to 
peaceful economic development, there was no longer any reason for 
maintaining the rigid regime of War Communismthe product of war 
and blockade. 
The Central Committee realized that the need for the surplus-appropriation 
system had passed, that it was time to supersede it by a tax 
in kind so as to enable the peasants to use the greater part of their surpluses 
at their own discretion. The Central Committee realized that 
this measure would make it possible to revive agriculture, to extend the 
cultivation of grain and industrial crops required for the development 
of industry, to revive the circulation of commodities, to improve supplies 
to the towns, and to create a new foundation, an economic foundation 
for the alliance of workers and peasants. 
The Central Committee realized also that the prime task was to 
revive industry, but considered that this could not be done without enlisting 
the support of the working class and its trade unions; it considered 
that the workers could be enlisted in this work by showing them that the 
economic disruption was just as dangerous an enemy of the people as the 
intervention and the blockade had been, and that the Party and the 
trade unions could certainly succeed in this work if they exercised their 
influence on the working class not by military commands, as had been 
the case at the front, where commands were really essential, but by 
methods of persuasion, by convincing it. 
But not all members of the Party were of the same mind as the 
Central Committee. The small opposition groupsthe Trotskyites, 
³Workers¹ Opposition,² ³Left Communists,² ³Democratic-Centralists,² 
etc.wavered and vacillated in face of the difficulties attending the 
transition to peaceful economic construction. There were in the Party 
quite a number of ex-members of the Menshevik, Socialist-Revolutionary, 
Bund and Borotbist parties, and all kinds of semi-nationalists from the 
border regions of Russia. Most of them allied themselves with one opposition 
group or another. These people were not real Marxists, they were 
ignorant of the laws of economic development, and had not had a Leninist-
Party schooling, and they only helped to aggravate the confusion and 
vacillations of the opposition groups. Some of them thought that it would

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 252 
be wrong to relax the rigid regime of War Communism, that, on the 
contrary, ³the screws must be tightened.² Others thought that the 
Party and the state should stand aside from the economic restoration, 
and that it should be left entirely in the hands of the trade unions. 
It was clear that with such confusion reigning among certain groups 
in the Party, lovers of controversy, opposition ³leaders² of one kind or 
another were bound to try to force a discussion upon the Party. 
And that is just what happened. 
The discussion started over the role of the trade unions, although 
the trade unions were not the chief problem of Party policy at the time. 
It was Trotsky who started the discussion and the fight against Lenin, 
against the Leninist majority of the Central Committee. With the intention 
of aggravating the situation, he came out at a meeting of Communist 
delegates to the Fifth All-Russian Trade Union Conference, 
held at the beginning of November 1920, with the dubious slogans of 
³tightening the screws² and ³shaking up the trade unions.² Trotsky 
demanded that the trade unions be immediately ³governmentalized.² 
He was against the use of persuasion in relations with the working class, 
and was in favour of introducing military methods in the trade unions. 
Trotsky was against any extension of democracy in the trade unions, 
against the principle of electing trade union bodies. 
Instead of methods of persuasion, without which the activities of 
working-class organizations are inconceivable, the Trotskyites proposed 
methods of sheer compulsion, of dictation. Applying this policy wherever 
they happened to occupy leading positions in the trade unions, the 
Trotskyites caused conflicts, disunity and demoralization in the unions. 
By their policy the Trotskyites were setting the mass of the non-Party 
workers against the Party, were splitting the working class. 
As a matter of fact, the discussion on the trade unions was of much 
broader import than the trade union question. As was stated later in 
the resolution of the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Russian 
Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted on January 17, 1925, the actual 
point at issue was ³the policy to be adopted towards the peasantry, who 
were rising against War Communism, the policy to be adopted towards 
the mass of the non-Party workers, and, in general, what was to be the 
approach of the Party to the masses in the period when the Civil War 
was coming to an end.² (Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.], Russ ed., 
Part I, p. 651.) 
Trotsky¹s lead was followed by other anti-Party groups: the ³Workers¹ 
Opposition² (Shlyapnikov, Medvedyev, Kollontai and others), the

253 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
³Democratic-Centralists² (Sapronov, Drobnis, Boguslavsky, Ossinsky, 
V. Smirnov and others), the ³Left Communists² (Bukharin, Preobrazhensky). 
The ³Workers¹ Opposition² put forward a slogan demanding that 
the administration of the entire national economy be entrusted to an 
³All-Russian Producers¹ Congress.² They wanted to reduce the role 
of the Party to nought, and denied the importance of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat to economic development. The ³Workers¹ Opposition² 
contended that the interests of the trade unions were opposed to those 
of the Soviet state and the Communist Party. They held that the trade 
unions, and not the Party, were the highest form of working-class organization. 
The ³Workers¹ Opposition² was essentially an anarchosyndicalist 
anti-Party group. 
The ³Democratic-Centralists² (Decists) demanded complete freedom 
for factions and groupings. Like the Trotskyites, the ³Democratic- 
Centralists² tried to undermine the leadership of the Party in the Soviets 
and in the trade unions. Lenin spoke of the ³Democratic-Centralists² 
as a faction of ³champion shouters,² and of their platform as a Socialist- 
Revolutionary-Menshevik platform. 
Trotsky was assisted in his fight against Lenin and the Party by 
Bukharin. With Preobrazhensky, Serebryakov and Sokolnikov, Bukharin 
formed a ³buffer² group. This group defended and shielded the Trotskyites, 
the most vicious of all factionalists. Lenin said that Bukharin¹s 
behaviour was the ³acme of ideological depravity.² Very soon, the Bukharinites 
openly joined forces with the Trotskyites against Lenin. 
Lenin and the Leninists concentrated their fire on the Trotskyites 
as the backbone of the anti-Party groupings. They condemned the Trotskyites 
for ignoring the difference between trade unions and military 
bodies and warned them that military methods could not be applied to 
the trade unions. Lenin and the Leninists drew up a platform of their 
own, entirely contrary in spirit to the platforms of the opposition groups. 
In this platform, the trade unions were defined as a school of administration, 
a school of management, a school of Communism. The trade 
unions should base all their activities on methods of persuasion. Only 
then would the trade unions rouse the workers as a whole to combat the 
economic disruption and be able to enlist them in the work of Socialist 
construction. 
In this fight against the opposition groupings, the Party organizations 
rallied around Lenin. The struggle took an especially acute form 
in Moscow. Here the opposition concentrated its main forces, with the 
object of capturing the Party organization of the capital. But these

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 254 
factionalist intrigues were frustrated by the spirited resistance of the 
Moscow Bolsheviks. An acute struggle broke out in the Ukrainian Party 
organizations as well. Led by Comrade Molotov, then the secretary of 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine, the 
Ukrainian Bolsheviks routed the Trotskyites and Shlyapnikovites. The 
Communist Party of the Ukraine remained a loyal support of Lenin¹s 
Party. In Baku, the routing of the opposition was led by Comrade 
Ordjonikidze. In Central Asia, the fight against the anti-Party groupings 
were headed by Comrade L. Kaganovich. 
All the important local organizations of the Party endorsed Lenin¹s 
platform. 
On March 8, 1921, the Tenth Party Congress opened. The congress 
was attended by 694 delegates with vote, representing 732,521 
Party members, and 296 delegates with voice but no vote. 
The congress summed up the discussion on the trade unions and 
endorsed Lenin¹s platform by an overwhelming majority. 
In opening the congress, Lenin said that the discussion had been an 
inexcusable luxury. He declared that the enemies had speculated on the 
inner Party strife and on a split in the ranks of the Communist Party. 
Realizing how extremely dangerous the existence of factional groups 
was to the Bolshevik Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat, the 
Tenth Congress paid special attention to Party unity. The report on 
this question was made by Lenin. The congress passed condemnation 
on all the opposition groups and declared that they were ³in fact helping 
the class enemies of the proletarian revolution.² 
The congress ordered the immediate dissolution of all factional 
groups and instructed all Party organizations to keep a strict watch to 
prevent any outbreaks of factionalism, non-observance of the congress 
decision to be followed by unconditional and immediate expulsion from 
the Party. The congress authorized the Central Committee, in the event 
of members of that body violating discipline, or reviving or tolerating 
factionalism, to apply to them all Party penalties, including expulsion 
from the Central Committee and from the Party. 
These decisions were embodied in a special resolution on ³Party 
Unity,² moved by Lenin and adopted by the congress. 
In this resolution, the congress reminded all Party members that 
unity and solidarity of the ranks of the Party, unanimity of will of the 
vanguard of the proletariat were particularly essential at that juncture, 
when a number of circumstances had, during the time of the Tenth 
Congress, increased the vacillation among the petty-bourgeois population 
of the country.

255 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
³Notwithstanding this,² read the resolution, ³even before the 
general Party discussion on the trade unions, certain signs of factionalism 
had been apparent in the Party, viz., the formation of 
groups with separate platforms, striving to a certain degree to segregate 
and create their own group discipline. All class-conscious workers 
must clearly realize the perniciousness and impermissibility of 
factionalism of any kind, for in practice factionalism inevitably results 
in weakening team work. At the same time it inevitably leads to 
intensified and repeated attempts by the enemies of the Party, who 
have fastened themselves onto it because it is the governing party, to 
widen the cleavage (in the Party) and to use it for counter-revolutionary 
purposes.² 
Further, in the same resolution, the congress said: 
³The way the enemies of the proletariat take advantage of every 
deviation from the thoroughly consistent Communist line was most 
strikingly shown in the case of the Kronstadt mutiny, when the bourgeois 
counter-revolutionaries and Whiteguards in all countries of the 
world immediately expressed their readiness to accept even the slogans 
of the Soviet system, if only they might thereby secure the overthrow 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia, and when the Socialist- 
Revolutionaries and the bourgeois counter-revolutionaries in general 
resorted in Kronstadt to slogans calling for an insurrection against 
the Soviet Government of Russia ostensibly in the interest of Soviet 
power. These facts fully prove that the Whiteguards strive, and 
are able to disguise themselves as Communists, and even as people 
³more Left² than the Communists, solely for the purpose of 
weakening and overthrowing the bulwark of the proletarian revolution 
in Russia. Menshevik leaflets distributed in Petrograd on the 
eve of the Kronstadt mutiny likewise show how the Mensheviks 
took advantage of the disagreements in the R.C.P. actually in order 
to egg on and support the Kronstadt mutineers, the Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and Whiteguards, while claiming to be opponents of 
mutiny and supporters of the Soviet power, only with supposedly 
slight modifications.² 
The resolution declared that in its propaganda the Party must explain 
in detail the harm and danger of factionalism to Party unity and to 
the unity of purpose of the vanguard of the proletariat, which is a fundamental 
condition for the success of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 256 
On the other hand, the congress resolution stated, the Party must 
explain in its propaganda the peculiarity of the latest tactical methods 
employed by the enemies of the Soviet power. 
³These enemies,² read the resolution, ³having realized the hopelessness 
of counter-revolution under an openly Whiteguard flag, are 
now doing their utmost to utilize the disagreements within the R.C.P. 
and to further the counter-revolution in one way or another by 
transferring the power to the political groupings which outwardly 
are closest to the recognition of the Soviet power.² (Resolutions of 
the C.P.S.U.[B.], Russ. ed., Part I, pp. 373-74.) 
The resolution further stated that in its propaganda the Party ³must 
also teach the lessons of preceding revolutions in which the counter-revolutionaries 
usually supported the petty-bourgeois groupings which stood 
closest to the extreme revolutionary Party, in order to undermine and 
overthrow the revolutionary dictatorship, and thus pave the way for the 
subsequent complete victory of the counter-revolution, of the capitalists 
and landlords.² 
Closely allied to the resolution on ³Party Unity² was the resolution 
on ³The Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in our Party,² also moved 
by Lenin and adopted by the congress. In this resolution the Tenth 
Congress passed condemnation on the so-called ³Workers¹ Opposition.² 
The congress declared that the propaganda of the ideas of the anarchosyndicalist 
deviation was incompatible with membership in the Communist 
Party, and called upon the Party vigorously to combat this deviation. 
The Tenth Congress passed the highly important decision to replace 
the surplus-appropriation system by a tax in kind, to adopt the New 
Economic Policy (NEP). 
This turn from War Communism to NEP is a striking instance of 
the wisdom and farsightedness of Lenin¹s policy. 
The resolution of the congress dealt with the substitution of a tax 
in kind for the surplus-appropriation system. The tax in kind was to be 
lighter than the assessments under the surplus-appropriation system. The 
total amount of the tax was to be announced each year before the spring 
sowing. The dates of delivery under the tax were to be strictly specified. 
All produce over and above the amount of the tax was to be entirely 
at the disposal of the peasant, who would be at liberty to sell these 
surpluses at will. In his speech, Lenin said that freedom of trade would 
at first lead to a certain revival of capitalism in the country. It would

257 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
be necessary to permit private trade and to allow private manufacturers 
to open small businesses. But no fears need be entertained on this score. 
Lenin considered that a certain freedom of trade would give the peasant 
an economic incentive, induce him to produce more and would lead to 
a rapid improvement of agriculture; that, on this basis, the state-owned 
industries would be restored and private capital displaced; that strength 
and resources having been accumulated, a powerful industry could be 
created as the economic foundation of Socialism, and that then a determined 
offensive could be undertaken to destroy the remnants of capitalism 
in the country. 
War Communism had been an attempt to take the fortress of the 
capitalist elements in town and countryside by assault, by a frontal attack. 
In this offensive the Party had gone too far ahead, and ran the risk of 
being cut off from its base. Now Lenin proposed to retire a little, to 
retreat for a while nearer to the base, to change from an assault of the 
fortress to the slower method of siege, so as to gather strength and 
resume the offensive. 
The Trotskyites and other oppositionists held that NEP was nothing 
but a retreat. This interpretation suited their purpose, for their line 
was to restore capitalism. This was a most harmful, anti-Leninist interpretation 
of NEP. The fact is that only a year after NEP was introduced 
Lenin declared at the Eleventh Party Congress that the retreat 
had come to an end, and he put forward the slogan: ³Prepare for an 
offensive on private capital.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. 
XXVII (p. 213.) 
The oppositionists, poor Marxists and crass ignoramuses in questions 
of Bolshevik policy as they were, understood neither the meaning of 
NEP nor the character of the retreat undertaken at the beginning of 
NEP. We have dealt with the meaning of NEP above. As for the 
character of the retreat, there are retreats and retreats. There are times 
when a party or an army has to retreat because it has suffered defeat. 
In such cases, the army or party retreats to preserve itself and its ranks 
for new battles. It was no such retreat that Lenin proposed when 
NEP was introduced, because, far from having suffered defeat or discomfiture, 
the Party had itself defeated the interventionists and Whiteguards 
in the Civil War. But there are other times, when in its advance a 
victorious party or army runs too far ahead, without providing itself with 
an adequate base in the rear. This creates a serious danger. So as not 
to lose connection with its base, an experienced party or army generally 
finds it necessary in such cases to fall back a little, to draw closer to 
and establish better contact with its base, in order to provide itself with

all it needs, and then resume the offensive more confidently and with 
guarantee of success. It was this kind of temporary retreat that Lenin 
effected by the New Economic Policy. Reporting to the Fourth Congress 
of the Communist International on the reasons that prompted the 
introduction of NEP, Lenin plainly said, ³in our economic offensive 
we ran too far ahead, we did not provide ourselves with an adequate 
base,² and so it was necessary to make a temporary retreat to a secure 
rear.
The misfortune of the opposition was that, in their ignorance, they 
did not understand, and never understood to the end of their days, this 
feature of the retreat under NEP. 
The decision of the Tenth Congress on the New Economic Policy 
ensured a durable economic alliance of the working class and the peasantry 
for the building of Socialism. 
This prime object was served by yet another decision of the congress 
the decision on the national question. The report on the national 
question was made by Comrade Stalin. He said that we had abolished 
national oppression, but that this was not enough. The task was to do 
away with the evil heritage of the pastthe economic, political and 
cultural backwardness of the formerly oppressed peoples. They had to 
be helped to catch up with Central Russia. 
Comrade Stalin further referred to two anti-Party deviations on the 
national question: dominant-nation (Great-Russian) chauvinism and 
local nationalism. The congress condemned both deviations as harmful 
and dangerous to Communism and proletarian internationalism. At the 
same time, it directed its main blow at the bigger danger, dominantnation 
chauvinism, i.e., the survivals and hangovers of the attitude 
towards the nationalities such as the Great-Russian chauvinists had displayed 
towards the non-Russian peoples under tsardom. 
3. FIRST RESULTS OF NEP. ELEVENTH PARTY CONGRESS. FORMATION 
OF THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS. 
LENIN¹S ILLNESS. LENIN¹S CO-OPERATIVE PLAN. TWELFTH 
PARTY CONGRESS 
The New Economic Policy was resisted by the unstable elements in 
the Party. The resistance came from two quarters. First there were 
the ³Left² shouters, political freaks like Lominadze, Shatskin and others, 
who argued that NEP meant a renunciation of the gains of the October 
Revolution, a return to capitalism, the downfall of the Soviet power. 
Because of their political illiteracy and ignorance of the laws of economic

259 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
development, these people did not understand the policy of the Party, 
fell into a panic, and sowed dejection and discouragement. Then there 
were the downright capitulators, like Trotsky, Radek, Zinoviev, Sokolnikov, 
Kamenev, Shlyapnikov, Bukharin, Rykov and others, who did 
not believe that the Socialist development of our country was possible, 
bowed before the ³omnipotence² of capitalism and, in their endeavour 
to strengthen the position of capitalism in the Soviet country, demanded 
far-reaching concessions to private capital, both home and foreign, and 
the surrender of a number of key positions of the Soviet power in the 
economic field to private capitalists, the latter to act either as concessionaries 
or as partners of the state in mixed joint stock companies. 
Both groups were alien to Marxism and Leninism. 
Both were exposed and isolated by the Party, which passed severe 
stricture on the alarmists and the capitulators. 
This resistance to the Party policy was one more reminder that the 
Party needed to be purged of unstable elements. Accordingly, the Central 
Committee in 1921 organized a Party purge, which helped to considerably 
strengthen the Party. The purging was done at open meetings, 
in the presence and with the participation of non-Party people. Lenin 
advised that the Party be thoroughly cleansed ³of rascals, bureaucrats, 
dishonest or wavering Communists, and of Mensheviks who have repainted 
their façade¹ but who have remained Mensheviks at heart.² 
(Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXVII, p. 13.) 
Altogether, nearly 170,000 persons, or about 25 per cent of the 
total membership, were expelled from the Party as a result of the purge. 
The purge greatly strengthened the Party, improved its social composition, 
increased the confidence of the masses in it, and heightened its 
prestige. The Party became more closely welded and better disciplined. 
The correctness of the New Economic Policy was proved in its very 
first year. Its adoption served greatly to strengthen the alliance of workers 
and peasants on a new basis. The dictatorship of the proletariat 
gained in might and strength. Kulak banditry was almost completely 
liquidated. The middle peasants, now that the surplus-appropriation 
system had been abolished, helped the Soviet Government to fight the 
kulak bands. The Soviet Government retained all the key positions in the 
economic field: large-scale industry, the means of transport, the banks, 
the land, and home and foreign trade. The Party achieved a definite 
turn for the better on the economic front. Agriculture soon began to 
forge ahead. Industry and the railways could record their first successes. 
An economic revival began, still very slow but sure. The workers and 
the peasants felt and perceived that the Party was on the right track.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 260
In March 1922, the Party held its Eleventh Congress. It was attended 
by 522 voting delegates, representing 532,000 Party members, 
which was less than at the previous congress. There were 165 delegates 
with voice but no vote. The reduction in the membership was due to 
the Party purge which had already begun. 
At this congress the Party reviewed the results of the first year of 
the New Economic Policy. These results entitled Lenin to declare at 
the congress: 
³For a year we have been retreating. In the name of the Party 
we must now call a halt. The purpose pursued by the retreat has 
been achieved. This period is drawing, or has drawn, to a close. 
Now our purpose is differentto regroup our forces.² (Ibid., 
p. 238.) 
Lenin said that NEP meant a life and death struggle between 
capitalism and Socialism. ³Who will win?²that was the question. 
In order that we might win, the bond between the working class and the 
peasantry, between Socialist industry and peasant agriculture, had to be 
made secure by developing the exchange of goods between town and 
country to the utmost. For this purpose the art of management and of 
efficient trading would have to be learned. 
At that period, trade was the main link in the chain of problems 
that confronted the Party. Unless this problem were solved it would 
be impossible to develop the exchange of goods between town and country, 
to strengthen the economic alliance between the workers and peasants, 
impossible to advance agriculture, or to extricate industry from its state 
of disruption. 
Soviet trade at that time was still very undeveloped. The machinery 
of trade was highly inadequate. Communists had not yet learned the 
art of trade; they had not studied the enemy, the Nepman, or learned 
how to combat him. The private traders, or Nepmen, had taken advantage 
of the undeveloped state of Soviet trade to capture the trade 
in textiles and other goods in general demand. The organization of 
state and co-operative trade became a matter of utmost importance. 
After the Eleventh Congress, work in the economic sphere was resumed 
with redoubled vigour. The effects of the recent harvest failure 
were successfully remedied. Peasant farming showed rapid recovery. 
The railways began to work better. Increasing numbers of factories 
and plants resumed operation. 
In October 1922, the Soviet Republic celebrated a great victory 
Vladivostok, the last piece of Soviet territory to remain in the hands of

261 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
the invaders, was wrested by the Red Army and the Far Eastern partisan 
from the hands of the Japanese. 
The whole territory of the Soviet republic having been cleared of 
interventionists, and the needs of Socialist construction and national defence 
demanding a further consolidation of the union of the Soviet 
peoples, the necessity now arose of welding the Soviet republics closer 
together in a single federal state. All the forces of the people had to be 
combined for the work of building Socialism. The country had to be 
made impregnable. Conditions had to be created for the all-round 
development of every nationality in our country. This required that 
all the Soviet nations should be brought into still closer union. 
In December 1922 the First All-Union Congress of Soviets was 
held, at which, on the proposal of Lenin and Stalin, a voluntary state 
union of the Soviet nations was formedthe Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics (U.S.S.R.). Originally, the U.S.S.R. comprised the Russian 
Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (R.S.F.S.R.), the Trancaucasian 
Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (T.S.F.S.R.), the Ukrainian Soviet 
Socialist Republic (Ukr. S.S.R.) and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist 
Republic (B.S.S.R.). Somewhat later, three independent Union Soviet 
Republicsthe Uzbek, Turkmen and Tadjikwere formed in Central 
Asia. All these republics have now united in a single union of Soviet 
statesthe U.S.S.R.on a voluntary and equal basis, each of them 
being reserved the right of freely seceding from the Soviet Union. 
The formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics meant the 
consolidation of the Soviet power and a great victory for the Leninist- 
Stalinist policy of the Bolshevik Party on the national question. 
In November 1922, Lenin made a speech at a plenary meeting of 
the Moscow Soviet in which he reviewed the five years of Soviet rule 
and expressed the firm conviction that ³NEP Russia will become Socialist 
Russia.² This was his last speech to the country. That same autumn 
a great misfortune overtook the Party: Lenin fell seriously ill. His illness 
was a deep and personal affliction to the whole Party and to all the 
working people. All lived in trepidation for the life of their beloved 
Lenin. But even in illness Lenin did not discontinue his work. When 
already a very sick man, he wrote a number of highly important articles. 
In these last writings he reviewed the work already performed and outlined 
a plan for the building of Socialism in our country by enlisting 
the peasantry in the cause of Socialist construction. This contained his 
co-operative plan for securing the participation of the peasantry in the 
work of building Socialism. 
Lenin regarded co-operative societies in general, and agricultural co

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 262 
operative societies in particular, as a means of transitiona means within 
the reach and understanding of the peasant millionsfrom small, individual 
farming to large-scale producing associations, or collective farms. 
Lenin pointed out that the line to be followed in the development of 
agriculture in our country was to draw the peasants into the work of 
building Socialism through the co-operative societies, gradually to introduce 
the collective principle in agriculture, first in the selling, and then in 
the growing of farm produce. With the dictatorship of the proletariat 
and the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, with the leadership 
of the peasantry by the proletariat made secure, and with the existence 
of a Socialist industry, Lenin said, a properly organized producing cooperative 
system embracing millions of peasants was the means whereby 
a complete Socialist society could be built in our country. 
In April 1923, the Party held its Twelfth Congress. Since the 
seizure of power by the Bolsheviks this was the first congress at which 
Lenin was unable to be present. The congress was attended by 408 
voting delegates, representing 386,000 Party members. This was less 
than was represented at the previous congress, the reduction being due 
to the fact that in the interval the Party purge had continued and had 
resulted in the expulsion of a considerable percentage of the Party membership. 
There were 417 delegates with voice but no vote. 
The Twelfth Party Congress embodied in its decisions the recommendations 
made by Lenin in his recent articles and letters. 
The congress sharply rebuked those who took NEP to mean a retreat 
from the Socialist position, a surrender to capitalism, and who 
advocated a return to capitalist bondage. Proposals of this kind were 
made at the congress by Radek and Krassin, followers of Trotsky. They 
proposed that we should throw ourselves on the tender mercies of foreign 
capitalists, surrender to them, in the form of concessions, branches of 
industry that were of vital necessity to the Soviet state. They proposed 
that we pay the tsarist government¹s debts annulled by the October 
Revolution. The Party stigmatized these capitulatory proposals as 
treachery. It did not reject the policy of granting concessions, but 
favoured it only in such industries and in such dimensions as would be 
of advantage to the Soviet state. 
Bukharin and Sokolnikov had even prior to the congress proposed 
the abolition of the state monopoly of foreign trade. The proposal 
was also based on the conception that NEP was a surrender to capitalism. 
Lenin had branded Bukharin as a champion of the profiteers, 
Nepmen and kulaks. The Twelfth Congress firmly repelled the attempts 
to undermine the monopoly of foreign trade.

263 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
The congress also repelled Trotsky¹s attempt to foist upon the Party 
a policy towards the peasantry that would have been fatal, and stated 
that the predominance of small peasant farming in the country was a 
fact not to be forgotten. It emphatically declared that the development 
of industry, including heavy industry, must not run counter to the interests 
of the peasant masses, but must be based on a close bond with 
the peasants, in the interests of the whole working population. These 
decisions were an answer to Trotsky, who had proposed that we should 
build up our industry by exploiting the peasants, and who in fact did 
not accept the policy of an alliance of the proletariat with the peasantry. 
At the same time, Trotsky had proposed that big plants like the 
Putilov, Bryansk and others, which were of importance to the country¹s 
defence, should be closed down allegedly on the grounds that they were 
unprofitable. The congress indignantly rejected Trotsky¹s proposals. 
On Lenin¹s proposal, sent to the congress in written form, the 
Twelfth Congress united the Central Control Commission of the Party 
and the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection into one body. To this 
united body were entrusted the important duties of safeguarding the 
unity of our Party, strengthening Party and civil discipline, and improving 
the Soviet state apparatus in every way. 
An important item on the agenda of the congress was the national 
question, the report on which was made by Comrade Stalin. Comrade 
Stalin stressed the international significance of our policy on the national 
question. To the oppressed peoples in the East and West, the Soviet 
Union was a model of the solution of the national question and the 
abolition of national oppression. He pointed out that energetic measures 
were needed to put an end to economic and cultural inequality among 
the peoples of the Soviet Union. He called upon the Party to put up a 
determined fight against deviations in the national questionGreat- 
Russian chauvinism and local bourgeois nationalism. 
The nationalist deviators and their dominant-nation policy towards 
the national minorities were exposed at the congress. At that time the 
Georgian nationalist deviators, Mdivani and others, were opposing the 
Party. They had been against the formation of the Trancaucasian 
Federation and were against the promotion of friendship between the 
peoples of Transcaucasia. The deviators were behaving like outright 
dominant-nation chauvinists towards the other nationalities of Georgia. 
They were expelling non-Georgians from Tiflis wholesale, especially 
Armenians; they had passed a law under which Georgian women who 
married non-Georgians lost their Georgian citizenship. The Georgian

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 264 
nationalist deviators were supported by Trotsky, Radek, Bukharin, 
Skrypnik and Rakovsky. 
Shortly after the congress, a special conference of Party workers 
from the national republics was called to discuss the national question. 
Here were exposed a group of Tatar bourgeois nationalistsSultan- 
Galiev and othersand a group of Uzbek nationalist deviatorsFaizulla 
Khodjayev and others. 
The Twelfth Party Congress reviewed the results of the New Economic 
Policy for the past two years. They were very heartening results 
and inspired confidence in ultimate victory. 
³Our Party has remained solid and united; it has stood the test 
of a momentous turn, and is marching on with flying colours,² 
Comrade Stalin declared at the congress. 
4. STRUGGLE AGAINST THE DIFFICULTIES OF ECONOMIC RESTORATION. 
TROTSKYITES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LENIN¹S ILLNESS 
TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITY. NEW PARTY DISCUSSION. DEFEAT 
OF THE TROTSKYITES. DEATH OF LENIN. THE LENIN ENROLMENT. 
THIRTEENTH PARTY CONGRESS 
The struggle to restore the national economy yielded substantial 
results in its very first year. By 1924 progress was to be observed in all 
fields. The crop area had increased considerably since 1921, and peasant 
farming was steadily improving. Socialist industry was growing and 
expanding. The working class had greatly increased in numbers. Wages 
had risen. Life had become easier and better for the workers and peasants 
as compared with 1920 and 1921. 
But the effects of the economic disruption still made themselves felt. 
Industry was still below the pre-war level, and its development was still 
far behind the country¹s demand. At the end of 1923 there were about 
a million unemployed; the national economy was progressing too slowly 
to absorb unemployment. The development of trade was being hindered 
by the excessive prices of manufactured goods, prices which the Nepmen, 
and the Nepman elements in our trading organizations, were imposing 
on the country. Owing to this, the Soviet ruble began to fluctuate 
violently and to fall in value. These factors impeded the improvement 
of the condition of the workers and peasants. 
In the autumn of 1923, the economic difficulties were somewhat

265 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
aggravated owing to violations of the Soviet price policy by our industrial 
and commercial organizations. There was a yawning gap between the 
prices of manufactures and the prices of farm produce. Grain prices 
were low, while prices of manufacturers were inordinately high. Industry 
was burdened with excessive overhead costs which increased the price 
of goods. The money which the peasants received for their grain rapidly 
depreciated. To make matters worse, the Trotskyite Pyatakov, who 
was at that time on the Supreme Council of National Economy, gave 
managers and directors criminal instructions to grind all the profit 
they could out of the sale of manufactured goods and to force up prices 
to the maximum, ostensibly for the purpose of developing industry. As 
a matter of fact, this Nepman policy could only narrow the base of 
industry and undermine it. It became unprofitable for the peasantry to 
purchase manufactured goods, and they stopped buying them. The 
result was a sales crisis, from which industry suffered. Difficulties arose 
in the payment of wages. This provoked discontent among the workers. 
At some factories the more backward workers stopped work. 
The Central Committee of the Party adopted measures to remove 
these difficulties and anomalies. Steps were taken to overcome the sales 
crisis. Prices of consumers¹ goods were reduced. It was decided to reform 
the currency and to adopt a firm and stable currency unit, the chervonetz. 
The normal payment of wages was resumed. Measures were 
outlined for the development of trade through state and co-operative 
channels and for the elimination of private traders and profiteers. 
What was now required was that everybody should join in the common 
effort, roll up his sleeves, and set to work with gusto. That is the 
way all who were loyal to the Party thought and acted. But not so the 
Trotskyites. They took advantage of the absence of Lenin, who was 
incapacitated by grave illness, to launch a new attack on the Party and 
its leadership. They decided that this was a favourable moment to smash 
the Party and overthrow its leadership. They used everything they could 
as a weapon against the Party: the defeat of the revolution in Germany 
and Bulgaria in the autumn of 1923, the economic difficulties at home, 
and Lenin¹s illness. It was at this moment of difficulty for the Soviet 
state, when the Party¹s leader was stricken by sickness, that Trotsky 
started his attack on the Bolshevik Party. He mustered all the anti- 
Leninist elements in the Party and concocted an opposition platform 
against the Party, its leadership, and its policy. This platform was called 
the Declaration of the Forty-Six Oppositionists. All the opposition groupings
the Trotskyites, Democratic-Centralists, and the remnants of the 
³Left Communist² and ³Workers¹ Opposition² groupsunited to fight

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 266 
the Leninist Party. In their declaration, they prophesied a grave economic 
crisis and the fall of the Soviet power, and demanded freedom of 
factions and groups as the only way out of the situation. 
This was a fight for the restoration of factionalism which the Tenth 
Party Congress, on Lenin¹s proposal, had prohibited. 
The Trotskyites did not make a single definite proposal for the 
improvement of agriculture or industry, for the improvement of the circulation 
of commodities, or for the betterment of the condition of the 
working people. This did not even interest them. The only thing that 
interested them was to take advantage of Lenin¹s absence in order to 
restore factions within the Party, to undermine its foundations and its 
Central Committee. 
The platform of the forty-six was followed up by the publication 
of a letter by Trotsky in which he vilified the Party cadres and levelled 
new slanderous accusations against the Party. In this letter Trotsky 
harped on the old Menshevik themes which the Party had heard from 
him many times before. 
First of all the Trotskyites attacked the Party apparatus. They knew 
that without a strong apparatus the Party could not live and function. 
The opposition tried to undermine and destroy the Party apparatus, to set 
the Party members against it, and the young members against the old 
stalwarts of the Party. In this letter Trotsky played up to the students, 
the young Party members who were not acquainted with the history 
of the Party¹s fight against Trotskyism. To win the support of the 
students, Trotsky flatteringly referred to them as the ³Party¹s surest 
barometer,² at the same time declaring that the Leninist old guard had 
degenerated. Alluding to the degeneration of the leaders of the Second 
International, he made the foul insinuation that the old Bolshevik guard 
was going the same way. By this outcry about the degeneration of the 
Party, Trotsky tried to hide his own degeneration and his anti-Party 
scheming. 
The Trotskyites circulated both oppositionist documents, viz., the 
platform of the forty-six and Trotsky¹s letter, in the districts and among 
the Party nuclei and put them up for discussion by the Party membership. 
They challenged the Party to a discussion. 
Thus the Trotskyites forced a general discussion on the Party, just 
as they did at the time of the controversy over the trade union question 
before the Tenth Party Congress. 
Although the Party was occupied with the far more important problems 
of the country¹s economic life, it accepted the challenge and opened 
the discussion.

267 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
The whole Party was involved in the discussion. The fight took a 
most bitter form. It was fiercest of all in Moscow, for the Trotskyites 
endeavoured above all to capture the Party organization in the capital. 
But the discussion was of no help to the Trotskyites. It only disgraced 
them. They were completely routed both in Moscow and all other 
parts of the Soviet Union. Only a small number of nuclei in universities 
and offices voted for the Trotskyites. 
In January 1924 the Party held its Thirteenth Conference. The 
conference heard a report by Comrade Stalin, summing up the results of 
the discussion. The conference condemned the Trotskyite opposition, 
declaring that it was a petty-bourgeois deviation from Marxism. The 
decisions of the conference were subsequently endorsed by the Thirteenth 
Party Congress and the Fifth Congress of the Communist International. 
The international Communist proletariat supported the Bolshevik Party 
in its fight against Trotskyism. 
But the Trotskyites did not cease their subversive work. In the 
autumn of 1924, Trotsky published an article entitled, ³The Lessons 
of October² in which he attempted to substitute Trotskyism for Leninism. 
It was a sheer slander on our Party and its leader, Lenin. This 
defamatory broadsheet was seized upon by all enemies of Communism 
and of the Soviet Government. The Party was outraged by this unscrupulous 
distortion of the heroic history of Bolshevism. Comrade Stalin 
denounced Trotsky¹s attempt to substitute Trotskyism for Leninism. He 
declared that ³it is the duty of the Party to bury Trotskyism as an ideological 
trend.² 
An effective contribution to the ideological defeat of Trotskyism 
and to the defense of Leninism was Comrade Stalin¹s theoretical work, 
Foundations of Leninism published in 1924. This book is a masterly 
exposition and a weighty theoretical substantiation of Leninism. It was, 
and is today, a trenchant weapon of Marxist-Leninist theory in the 
hands of Bolsheviks all over the world. 
In the battles against Trotskyism, Comrade Stalin rallied the Party 
around its Central Committee and mobilized it to carry on the fight 
for the victory of Socialism in our country. Comrade Stalin proved that 
Trotskyism had to be ideologically demolished if the further victorious 
advance to Socialism was to be ensured. 
Reviewing this period of the fight against Trotskyism, Comrade 
Stalin said: 
³Unless Trotskyism is defeated, it will be impossible to achieve 
victory under the conditions of NEP, it will be impossible to convert 
present-day Russia into a Socialist Russia.²

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 268
But the successes attending the Party¹s Leninist policy were clouded 
by a most grievous calamity which now befell the Party and the working 
class. On January 21, 1924, Lenin, our leader and teacher, the creator 
of the Bolshevik Party, passed away in the village of Gorki, near Moscow. 
Lenin¹s death was received by the working class of the whole world as 
a most cruel loss. On the day of Lenin¹s funeral the international proletariat 
proclaimed a five-minute stoppage of work. Railways, mills and 
factories came to a standstill. As Lenin was borne to the grave, the 
working people of the whole world paid homage to him in overwhelming 
sorrow, as to a father and teacher, their best friend and defender. 
The loss of Lenin caused the working class of the Soviet Union to 
rally even more solidly around the Leninist Party. In those days of 
mourning every class-conscious worker defined his attitude to the Communist 
Party, the executor of Lenin¹s behest. The Central Committee 
of the Party received thousands upon thousands of applications from 
workers for admission to the Party. The Central Committee responded 
to this movement and proclaimed a mass admission of politically advanced 
workers into the Party ranks. Tens of thousands of workers 
flocked into the Party; they were people prepared to give their lives for 
the cause of the Party, the cause of Lenin. In a brief space of time 
over two hundred and forty thousand workers joined the ranks of the 
Bolshevik Party. They were the foremost section of the working class, 
the most class-conscious and revolutionary, the most intrepid and disciplined. 
This was the Lenin Enrolment. 
The reaction to Lenin¹s death demonstrated how close are our 
Party¹s ties with the masses, and how high a place the Leninist Party 
holds in the hearts of the workers. 
In the days of mourning for Lenin, at the Second Congress of 
Soviets of the U.S.S.R., Comrade Stalin made a solemn vow in the 
name of the Party. He said: 
³We Communists are people of a special mould. We are made 
of a special stuff. We are those who form the army of the great 
proletarian strategist, the army of Comrade Lenin. There is nothing 
higher than the honour of belonging to this army. There is nothing 
higher than the title of member of the Party whose founder and 
leader is Comrade Lenin. . . . 
³Departing from us, Comrade Lenin adjured us to hold high 
and guard the purity of the great title of member of the Party. We 
vow to you, Comrade Lenin, that we will fulfil your behest with 
honour! . . .

269 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
³Departing from us, Comrade Lenin adjured us to guard the 
unity of our Party as the apple of our eye. We vow to you, Comrade 
Lenin, that this behest, too, we will fulfil with honour! . . . 
³Departing from us, Comrade Lenin adjured us to guard and 
strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We vow to you, Comrade 
Lenin, that we will spare no effort to fulfil this behest, too, 
with honour! . . . 
³Departing from us, Comrade Lenin adjured us to strengthen 
with all our might the alliance of the workers and the peasants. 
We vow to you, Comrade Lenin, that this behest, too, we will fulfil 
with honour! . . . 
³Comrade Lenin untiringly urged upon us the necessity of maintaining 
the voluntary union of the nations of our country, the necessity 
for fraternal co-operation between them within the framework 
of the Union of Republics. Departing from us, Comrade Lenin 
adjured us to consolidate and extend the Union of Republics. We 
vow to you, Comrade Lenin, that this behest, too, we will fulfil with 
honour! . . . 
³More than once did Lenin point out to us that the strengthening 
of the Red Army and the improvement of its condition is one 
of the most important tasks of our Party. . . . Let us vow then, 
comrades, that we will spare no effort to strengthen our Red Army 
and our Red Navy. . . . 
³Departing from us, Comrade Lenin adjured us to remain faithful 
to the principles of the Communist International. We vow to 
you, Comrade Lenin, that we will not spare our lives to strengthen 
and extend the union of the toilers of the whole worldthe Communist 
International!² (Joseph Stalin, The Lenin Heritage.) 
This was the vow made by the Bolshevik Party to its leader, Lenin, 
whose memory will live throughout the ages. 
In May 1924 the Party held its Thirteenth Congress. It was 
attended by 748 voting delegates, representing a Party membership of 
735,881. This marked increase in membership in comparison with the 
previous congress was due to the admission of some 250,000 new members 
under the Lenin Enrolment. There were 416 delegates with voice 
but no vote. 
The congress unanimously condemned the platform of the Trotskyite 
opposition, defining it as a petty-bourgeois deviation from Marxism, as a 
revision of Leninism, and endorsed the resolutions of the Thirteenth

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 270 
Party Conference on ³Party Affairs² and ³The Results of the Discussion.² 
With the purpose of strengthening the bond between town and 
country, the congress gave instructions for a further expansion of industry, 
primarily of the light industries, while placing particular stress 
on the necessity for a rapid development of the iron and steel industry. 
The congress endorsed the formation of the People¹s Commissariat 
of Internal Trade and set the trading bodies the task of gaining control 
of the market and ousting private capital from the sphere of trade. 
The congress gave instructions for the increase of cheap state credit 
to the peasantry so as to oust the usurer from the countryside. 
The congress called for the maximum development of the co-operative 
movement among the peasantry as the paramount task in the countryside. 
Lastly, the congress stressed the profound importance of the Lenin 
Enrolment and drew the Party¹s attention to the necessity of devoting 
greater efforts to educating the young Party membersand above all 
the recruits of the Lenin Enrolmentin the principles of Leninism.

THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM IN OUR COUNTRY. ZINOVIEVKAMENEV 
³NEW OPPOSITION.² FOURTEENTH PARTY CONGRESS. 
POLICY OF SOCIALIST INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE 
COUNTRY 
For over four years the Bolshevik Party and the working class had 
been working strenuously along the lines of the New Economic Policy. 
The heroic work of economic restoration was approaching completion. 
The economic and political might of the Soviet Union was steadily 
growing. 
By this time the international situation had undergone a change. 
Capitalism had withstood the first revolutionary onslaught of the masses 
after the imperialist war. The revolutionary movement in Germany, 
Italy, Bulgaria, Poland and a number of other countries had been 
crushed. The bourgeoisie had been aided in this by the leaders of the 
compromising Social-Democratic parties. A temporary ebb in the tide 
of revolution set in. There began a temporary, partial stabilization of 
capitalism in Western Europe, a partial consolidation of the position of 
capitalism. But the stabilization of capitalism did not eliminate the basic 
contradictions rending capitalist society. On the contrary, the partial

TO MAO 


DISTRIBUTION 
stabilization of capitalism aggravated the contradictions between the 
workers and the capitalists, between imperialism and the colonial nations, 
between the imperialist groups of the various countries. The stabilization 
of capitalism was preparing for a new explosion of contradictions, for 
new crises in the capitalist countries. 
Parallel with the stabilization of capitalism, proceeded the stabilization 
of the Soviet Union. But these two processes of stabilization were 
fundamentally different in character. Capitalist stabilization presaged a 
new crisis of capitalism. The stabilization of the Soviet Union meant a 
further growth of the economic and political might of the Socialist 
country. 
Despite the defeat of the revolution in the West, the position of the 
Soviet Union in the international arena continued to grow stronger, 
although, it is true, at a slower rate. 
In 1922, the Soviet Union had been invited to an international economic 
conference in Genoa, Italy. At the Genoa Conference the imperialist 
governments, emboldened by the defeat of the revolution in the 
capitalist countries, tried to bring new pressure to bear on the Soviet 
Republic, this time in diplomatic form. The imperialists presented brazen 
demands to the Soviet Republic. They demanded that the factories and 
plants which had been nationalized by the October Revolution be returned 
to the foreign capitalists; they demanded the payment of the debts of the 
tsarist government. In return, the imperialist states promised some 
trifling loans to the Soviet Government. 
The Soviet Union rejected these demands. 
The Genoa Conference was barren of result. 
The threat of a new intervention contained in the ultimatum of 
Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, in 1923, also met with 
the rebuff it deserved. 
Having tested the strength of the Soviet Government and convinced 
themselves of its stability, the capitalist states began one after another 
to resume diplomatic relations with our country. In 1924 diplomatic 
relations were restored with Great Britain, France, Japan and Italy. 
It was plain that the Soviet Union had been able to win a prolonged 
breathing space, a period of peace. 
The domestic situation had also changed. The self-sacrificing efforts 
of the workers and peasants, led by the Bolshevik Party, had borne fruit. 
The rapid development of the national economy was manifest. In the 
fiscal year 1924-25, agricultural output had already approached the 
pre-war level, amounting to 87 per cent of the pre-war output. In 1925 
the large-scale industries of the U.S.S.R. were already producing about

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 272 
three-quarters of the pre-war industrial output. In the fiscal year 
1924-25, the Soviet Union was able to invest 385,000,000 rubles in 
capital construction work. The plan for the electrification of the country 
was proceeding successfully. Socialism was consolidating its key positions 
in the national economy. Important successes had been won in the 
struggle against private capital in industry and trade. 
Economic progress was accompanied by a further improvement in 
the condition of the workers and peasants. The working class was growing 
rapidly. Wages had risen, and so had productivity of labour. The 
standard of living of the peasants had greatly improved. In 1924-25, 
the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Government was able to assign nearly 
290,000,000 rubles for the purpose of assisting the small peasants. The 
improvement in the condition of the workers and peasants led to greater 
political activity on the part of the masses. The dictatorship of the proletariat 
was now more firmly established. The prestige and influence 
of the Bolshevik Party had grown. 
The restoration of the national economy was approaching completion. 
But mere economic restoration, the mere attainment of the prewar 
level, was not enough for the Soviet Union, the land of Socialism in 
construction. The pre-war level was the level of a backward country. 
The advance had to be continued beyond that point. The prolonged 
breathing space gained by the Soviet state ensured the possibility of 
further development. 
But this raised the question in all its urgency: what were to be the 
perspectives, the character of our development, of our construction, what 
was to be the destiny of Socialism in the Soviet Union? In what direction 
was economic development in the Soviet Union to be carried on, in 
the direction of Socialism, or in some other direction? Should we and 
could we build a Socialist economic system; or were we fated but to 
manure the soil for another economic system, the capitalist economic 
system? Was it possible at all to build a Socialist economic system in 
the U.S.S.R., and, if so, could it be built in spite of the delay of the 
revolution in the capitalist countries, in spite of the stabilization of capitalism? 
Was it at all possible to build a Socialist economic system by way 
of the New Economic Policy, which, while it was strengthening and 
augmenting the forces of Socialism in the country in every way, nevertheless 
still promoted a certain growth of capitalism? How was a 
Socialist economic system to be constructed, from which end should its 
construction begin? 
All these questions confronted the Party towards the end of the

273 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
restoration period, and no longer as theoretical questions, but as practical 
questions, as questions of everyday economic policy. 
All these questions needed straightforward and plain answers, so 
that our Party members engaged in the development of industry and 
agriculture, as well as the people generally, might know in what direction 
to work, towards Socialism, or towards capitalism. 
Unless plain answers were given to these questions, all our practical 
work of construction would be without perspective, work in the dark, 
labour in vain. 
The Party gave plain and definite answers to all these questions. 
Yes, replied the Party, a Socialist economic system could be and 
should be built in our country, for we had everything needed for the 
building of a Socialist economic system, for the building of a complete 
Socialist society. In October 1917 the working class had vanquished 
capitalism politically, by establishing its own political dictatorship. Since 
then the Soviet Government had been taking every measure to shatter 
the economic power of capitalism and to create conditions for the building 
of a Socialist economic system. These measures were: the expropriation 
of the capitalists and landlords; the conversion of the land, factories, 
mills, railways and the banks into public property; the adoption of the 
New Economic Policy; the building up of a state-owned Socialist industry; 
and the application of Lenin¹s co-operative plan. Now the 
main task was to proceed to build a new, Socialist economic system all 
over the country and thus smash capitalism economically as well. All our 
practical work, all our actions must be made to serve this main purpose. 
The working class could do it, and would do it. The realization of this 
colossal task must begin with the industrialization of the country. The 
Socialist industrialization of the country was the chief link in the chain; 
with it the construction of a Socialist economic system must begin. 
Neither the delay of the revolution in the West, nor the partial stabilization 
of capitalism in the non-Soviet countries could stop our advance 
to Socialism. The New Economic Policy could only make this task 
easier, for it had been introduced by the Party with the specific purpose 
of facilitating the laying of a Socialist foundation for our economic 
system. 
Such was the Party¹s answer to the questionwas the victory of 
Socialist construction possible in our country? 
But the Party knew that the problem of the victory of Socialism in 
one country did not end there. The construction of Socialism in the 
Soviet Union would be a momentous turning point in the history of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 274 
mankind, a victory for the working class and peasantry of the U.S.S.R., 
marking a new epoch in the history of the world. Yet this was an 
internal affair of the U.S.S.R. and was only a part of the problem of 
the victory of Socialism. The other part of the problem was its international 
aspect. In substantiating the thesis that Socialism could be 
victorious in one country, Comrade Stalin had repeatedly pointed out 
that the question should be viewed from two aspects, the domestic and 
the international. As for the domestic aspect of the question, i.e., the 
class relations within the country, the working class and the peasantry 
of the U.S.S.R. were fully capable of vanquishing their own bourgeoisie 
economically and building a complete Socialist society. But there was 
also the international aspect of the question, namely, the sphere of foreign 
relations, the sphere of the relations between the Soviet Union and the 
capitalist countries, between the Soviet people and the international bourgeoisie, 
which hated the Soviet system and was seeking the chance to 
start again armed intervention in the Soviet Union, to make new 
attempts to restore capitalism in the U.S.S.R. And since the U.S.S.R. 
was as yet the only Socialist country, all the other countries remaining 
capitalist, the U.S.S.R. continued to be encircled by a capitalist world, 
which gave rise to the danger of capitalist intervention. Clearly, there 
would be a danger of capitalist intervention as long as this capitalist encirclement 
existed. Could the Soviet people by their own efforts destroy 
this external danger, the danger of capitalist intervention in the U.S.S.R.? 
No, they could not. They could not, because in order to destroy the 
danger of capitalist intervention the capitalist encirclement would have 
to be destroyed; and the capitalist encirclement could be destroyed only 
as a result of victorious proletarian revolutions in at least several countries. 
It followed from this that the victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R., 
as expressed in the abolition of the capitalist economic system and the 
building of a Socialist economic system, could not be considered a final 
victory, inasmuch as the danger of foreign armed intervention and of 
attempts to restore capitalism had not been eliminated, and inasmuch 
as the Socialist country had no guarantee against this danger. To 
destroy the danger of foreign capitalist intervention, the capitalist encirclement 
would have to be destroyed. 
Of course, as long as the Soviet Government pursued a correct 
policy, the Soviet people and their Red Army would be able to beat off 
a new foreign capitalist intervention just as they had beaten off the first 
capitalist intervention of 1918-20. But this would not mean that the 
danger of new capitalist intervention would be eliminated. The defeat 
of the first intervention did not destroy the danger of new intervention,

275 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
inasmuch as the source of the danger of interventionthe capitalist encirclement
continued to exist. Neither would the danger of intervention 
be destroyed by the defeat of the new intervention if the capitalist encirclement 
continued to exist. 
It followed from this that the victory of the proletarian revolution in 
the capitalist countries was a matter of vital concern to the working 
people of the U.S.S.R. 
Such was the Party¹s line on the question of the victory of Socialism 
in our country. 
The Central Committee demanded that this line be discussed at 
the forthcoming Fourteenth Party Conference, and that it be endorsed 
and accepted as the line of the Party, as a Party law, binding upon all 
Party members. 
This line of the Party came as a thunderbolt to the oppositionists, 
above all, because the Party lent it a specific and practical character, linked 
it with a practical plan for the Socialist industrialization of the country, 
and demanded that it be formulated as a Party law, as a resolution of 
the Fourteenth Party Conference, binding upon all Party members. 
The Trotskyites opposed this Party line and set up against it the 
Menshevik ³theory of permanent revolution,² which it would be an 
insult to Marxism to call a Marxist theory, and which denied the possibility 
of the victory of Socialist construction in the U.S.S.R. 
The Bukharinites did not venture to oppose the Party line outspokenly. 
But they furtively set up against it their own ³theory² of the 
peaceful growing of the bourgeoisie into Socialism, amplifying it with 
a ³new² slogan³Get Rich!² According to the Bukharinites, the 
victory of Socialism meant fostering and encircling the bourgeoisie, not 
destroying it. 
Zinoviev and Kamenev ventured forth with the assertion that the 
victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. was impossible because of the country¹s 
technical and economic backwardness, but they soon found it prudent 
to hide under cover. 
The Fourteenth Party Conference (April, 1925) condemned all 
these capitulatory ³theories² of the open and covert oppositionists and 
affirmed the Party line of working for the victory of Socialism in the 
U.S.S.R., adopting a resolution to this effect. 
Driven to the wall, Zinoviev and Kamenev preferred to vote for 
this resolution. But the Party knew that they had only postponed their 
struggle and had decided to ³give battle to the Party² at the Fourteenth 
Party Congress. They were mustering a following in Leningrad and 
forming the so-called ³New Opposition.²

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 276 
The Fourteenth Party Congress opened in December 1925. 
The situation within the Party was tense and strained. Never in 
its history had there been a case when the whole delegation from an 
important Party centre like Leningrad had prepared to come out in 
opposition to their Central Committee. 
The congress was attended by 665 delegates with vote and 641 with 
voice but no vote, representing 643,000 Party members and 445,000 
candidate members, or a little less than at the previous congress. The 
reduction was due to a partial purge, a purge of the Party organizations 
in universities and offices to which anti-Party elements had gained entrance. 
The political report of the Central Committee was made by Comrade 
Stalin. He drew a vivid picture of the growth of the political and 
economic might of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the advantages of 
the Soviet economic system, both industry and agriculture had been restored 
in a comparatively short space of time and were approaching the 
pre-war level. But good as these results were, Comrade Stalin proposed 
that we should not rest there, for they could not nullify the fact that 
our country still remained a backward, agrarian country. Two-thirds 
of the total production of the country was provided by agriculture and 
only one-third by industry. Comrade Stalin said that the Party was now 
squarely confronted with the problem of converting our country into 
an industrial country, economically independent of capitalist countries. 
This could be done, and must be done. It was now the cardinal task 
of the Party to fight for the Socialist industrialization of the country, 
for the victory of Socialism. 
³The conversion of our country from an agrarian into an industrial 
country able to produce the machinery it needs by its own 
effortsthat is the essence, the basis of our general line,² said Comrade 
Stalin. 
The industrialization of the country would ensure its economic independence, 
strengthen its power of defence and create the conditions 
for the victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. 
The Zinovievites opposed the general line of the Party. As against 
Stalin¹s plan of Socialist industrialization, the Zinovievite Sokolnikov put 
forward a bourgeois plan, one that was then in vogue among the imperialist 
sharks. According to this plan, the U.S.S.R. was to remain 
an agrarian country, chiefly producing raw materials and foodstuffs, 
exporting them, and importing machinery, which it did not and should 
not produce itself. As conditions were in 1925, this was tantamount to

277 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
a plan for the economic enslavement of the U.S.S.R. by the industriallydeveloped 
foreign countries, a plan for the perpetuation of the industrial 
backwardness of the U.S.S.R. for the benefit of the imperialist sharks 
of the capitalist countries. 
The adoption of this plan would have converted our country into 
an impotent agrarian, agricultural appendage of the capitalist world; it 
would have left it weak and defenceless against the surrounding capitalist 
world, and in the end would have been fatal to the cause of Socialism 
in the U.S.S.R. 
The congress condemned the economic ³plan² of the Zinovievites 
as a plan for the enslavement of the U.S.S.R. 
Equally unsuccessful were the other sorties of the ³New Opposition² 
as, for instance, when they asserted (in defiance of Lenin) that 
our state industries were not Socialist industries, or when they declared 
(again in defiance of Lenin) that the middle peasant could not be an 
ally of the working class in the work of Socialist construction. 
The congress condemned these sorties of the ³New Opposition² as 
anti-Leninist. 
Comrade Stalin laid bare the Trotskyite-Menshevik essence of the 
³New Opposition.² He showed that Zinoviev and Kamenev were only 
harping on the old tunes of the enemies of the Party with whom Lenin 
had waged so relentless a struggle. 
It was clear that the Zinovievites were nothing but ill-disguised 
Trotskyites. 
Comrade Stalin stressed the point that the main task of our Party 
was to maintain a firm alliance between the working class and the middle 
peasant in the work of building Socialism. He pointed to two deviations 
on the peasant question existing in the Party at that time, both of which 
constituted a menace to this alliance. The first deviation was the one 
that underestimated and belittled the kulak danger, the second was the 
one that stood in panic fear of the kulak and underestimated the role 
of the middle peasant. To the question, which deviation was worse, 
Comrade Stalin replied: ³One is as bad as the other. And if these 
deviations are allowed to develop they may disintegrate and destroy 
the Party. Fortunately there are forces in our Party capable of ridding 
it of both deviations.² 
And the Party did indeed rout both deviations, the ³Left² and the 
Right, and rid itself of them. 
Summing up the debate on the question of economic development, 
the Fourteenth Party Congress unanimously rejected the capitulatory 
plans of the oppositionists and recorded in its now famous resolution:

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 278 
³In the sphere of economic development, the congress holds that 
in our land, the land of the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is 
every requisite for the building of a complete Socialist society¹ 
(Lenin). The congress considers that the main task of our Party 
is to fight for the victory of Socialist construction in the U.S.S.R.² 
The Fourteenth Party Congress adopted new Party Rules. 
Since the Fourteenth Congress our Party has been called the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
Though defeated at the congress, the Zinovievites did not submit 
to the Party. They started a fight against the decisions of the Fourteenth 
Congress. Immediately following the congress, Zinoviev called a meeting 
of the Leningrad Provincial Committee of the Young Communist 
League, the leading group of which had been reared by Zinoviev, Zalutsky, 
Bakayev, Yevdokimov, Kuklin, Safarov and other double-dealers 
in a spirit of hatred of the Leninist Central Committee of the Party. 
At this meeting, the Leningrad Provincial Committee passed a resolution 
unparalleled in the history of the Y.C.L.: it refused to abide by the 
decisions of the Fourteenth Party Congress. 
But the Zinovievite leaders of the Leningrad Y.C.L. did not in 
any way reflect the mind of the mass of Young Communist Leaguers 
of Leningrad. They were therefore easily defeated, and soon the Leningrad 
organization recovered the place in the Y.C.L. to which it was 
entitled. 
Towards the close of the Fourteenth Congress a group of congress 
delegatesComrades Molotov, Kirov, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Andreyev 
and otherswere sent to Leningrad to explain to the members of the 
Leningrad Party organization the criminal, anti-Bolshevik nature of the 
stand taken up at the congress by the Leningrad delegation, who had 
secured their mandates under false pretences. The meetings at which 
the reports on the congress were made were marked by stormy scenes. 
An extraordinary conference of the Leningrad Party organization was 
called. The overwhelming majority of the Party members of Leningrad 
(over 97 per cent) fully endorsed the decisions of the Fourteenth 
Party Congress and condemned the anti-Party Zinovievite ³New Opposition.² 
The latter already at that time were generals without an army. 
The Leningrad Bolsheviks remained in the front ranks of the Party 
of Lenin-Stalin. 
Summing up the results of the Fourteenth Party Congress, Comrade 
Stalin wrote:

279 1 9 2 1 - 1 9 2 5 
³The historical significance of the Fourteenth Congress of the 
C.P.S.U. lies in the fact that it was able to expose the very roots 
of the mistakes of the New Opposition, that it spurned their scepticism 
and sniveling, that it clearly and distinctly indicated the path 
of the further struggle for Socialism, opened before the Party the 
prospect of victory, and thus armed the proletariat with an invincible 
faith in the victory of Socialist construction.² (Stalin, 
Leninism, Vol. I, p. 319.) 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
The years of transition to the peaceful work of economic restoration 
constituted one of the most crucial periods in the history of the Bolshevik 
Party. In a tense situation, the Party was able to effect the difficult 
turn from the policy of War Communism to the New Economic Policy. 
The Party reinforced the alliance of the workers and peasants on a new 
economic foundation. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was 
formed. 
By means of the New Economic Policy, decisive results were obtained 
in the restoration of the economic life of the country. The Soviet 
Union emerged from the period of economic restoration with success 
and entered a new period, the period of industrialization of the country. 
The transition from Civil War to peaceful Socialist construction 
was accompanied by great difficulties, especially in the early stages. The 
enemies of Bolshevism, the anti-Party elements in the ranks of the 
C.P.S.U.(B.), waged a desperate struggle against the Leninist Party 
all through this period. These anti-Party elements were headed by 
Trotsky. His henchmen in this struggle were Kamenev, Zinoviev and 
Bukharin. After the death of Lenin, the oppositionists calculated on demoralizing 
the ranks of the Bolshevik Party, on splitting the Party, and 
infecting it with disbelief in the possibility of the victory of Socialism 
in the U.S.S.R. In point of fact, the Trotskyites were trying to form 
another party in the U.S.S.R., a political organization of the new bourgeoisie, 
a party of capitalist restoration. 
The Party rallied under the banner of Lenin around its Leninist 
Central Committee, around Comrade Stalin, and inflicted defeat both 
on the Trotskyites and on their new friends in Leningrad, the Zinoviev- 
Kamenev New Opposition. 
Having accumulated strength and resources, the Bolshevik Party 
brought the country to a new stage in its historythe stage of Socialist 
industrialization.

AND THE FIGHT TO OVERCOME THEM. FORMATION OF 
THE ANTI-PARTY BLOC OF TROTSKYITES AND ZINOVIEVITES. 
ANTI-SOVIET ACTIONS OF THE BLOC. DEFEAT OF THE BLOC 
After the Fourteenth Congress, the Party launched a vigorous struggle 
for the realization of the general line of the Soviet Government 
the Socialist industrialization of the country. 
In the restoration period the task had been to revive agriculture before 
all else, so as to obtain raw materials and foodstuffs, to restore and 
to set going the industries, the existing mills and factories. 
The Soviet Government coped with this task with comparative ease. 
But in the restoration period there were three major shortcomings: 
First, the mills and factories were old, equipped with worn-out 
and antiquated machinery, and might soon go out of commission. The task 
now was to re-equip them on up-to-date lines. 
Secondly, industry in the restoration period rested on too narrow a 
foundation: it lacked machine-building plants absolutely indispensable to 
the country. Hundreds of these plants had to be built, for without them 
no country can be considered as being really industrialized. The task 
now was to build these plants and to equip them on up-to-date lines. 
Thirdly, the industries in this period were mostly light industries. 
These were developed and put on their feet. But, beyond a certain 
point, the further development even of the light industries met an 
obstacle in the weakness of heavy industry, not to mention the fact 
that the country had other requirements which could be satisfied only 
by a well-developed heavy industry. The task now was to tip the scales 
in favour of heavy industry. 
All these new tasks were to be accomplished by the policy of Socialist 
industrialization. 
It was necessary to build up a large number of new industries, industries 
which had not existed in tsarist Russianew machinery, machine- 
280

281 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
tool, automobile, chemical, and iron and steel plantsto organize the production 
of engines and power equipment, and to increase the mining of 
ore and coal. This was essential for the victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. 
It was necessary to create a new munitions industry, to erect new 
works for the production of artillery, shells, aircraft, tanks and machine 
guns. This was essential for the defence of the U.S.S.R., surrounded 
as it was by a capitalist world. 
It was necessary to build tractor works and plants for the production 
of modern agricultural machinery, and to furnish agriculture with these 
machines, so as to enable millions of small individual peasant farms to 
pass to large-scale collective farming. This was essential for the victory 
of Socialism in the countryside. 
All this was to be achieved by the policy of industrialization, for that 
is what the Socialist industrialization of the country meant. 
Clearly, construction work on so large a scale would necessitate the 
investment of thousands of millions of rubles. To count on foreign 
loans was out of the question, for the capitalist countries refused to grant 
loans. We had to build with our own resources, without foreign assistance. 
But we were then a poor country. 
There lay one of the chief difficulties. 
Capitalist countries as a rule built up their heavy industries with 
funds obtained from abroad, whether by colonial plunder, or by exacting 
indemnities from vanquished nations, or else by foreign loans. The Soviet 
Union could not as a matter of principle resort to such infamous means 
of obtaining funds as the plunder of colonies or of vanquished nations. 
As for foreign loans, that avenue was closed to the U.S.S.R., as the 
capitalist countries refused to lend it anything. The funds had to be 
found inside the country. 
And they were found. Financial sources were tapped in the U.S.S.R. 
such as could not be tapped in any capitalist country. The Soviet state 
had taken over all the mills, factories, and lands which the October 
Socialist Revolution had wrested from the capitalists and landlords, all 
the means of transportation, the banks, and home and foreign trade. 
The profits from the state-owned mills and factories, and from the means 
of transportation, trade and the banks now went to further the expansion 
of industry, and not into the pockets of a parasitic capitalist class. 
The Soviet Government had annulled the tsarist debts, on which the 
people had annually paid hundreds of millions of gold rubles in interest 
alone. By abolishing the right of the landlords to the land, the Soviet 
Government had freed the peasantry from the annual payment of about

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 282 
500,000,000 gold rubles in rent. Released from this burden, the peasantry 
was in a position to help the state to build a new and powerful 
industry. The peasants had a vital interest in obtaining tractors and 
other agricultural machinery. 
All these sources of revenue were in the hands of the Soviet state. 
They could yield hundreds and thousands of millions of rubles for the 
creation of a heavy industry. All that was needed was a business-like 
approach, the strictly economical expenditure of funds, rationalization 
of industry, reduction of costs of production, elimination of unproductive 
expenditure, etc. 
And this was the course the Soviet Government adopted. 
Thanks to a regime of strict economy, the funds available for capital 
development increased from year to year. This made it possible to start 
on gigantic construction works like the Dnieper Hydro-Electric Power 
Station, the Turkestan-Siberian Railway, the Stalingrad Tractor Works, 
a number of machine-tool works, the AMO (ZIS) Automobile Works 
and others. 
Whereas in 1926-27 about 1,000,000,000 rubles were invested in 
industry, three years later it was found possible to invest about 
5,000,000,000 rubles. 
Industrialization was making steady headway. 
The capitalist countries looked upon the growing strength of the 
Socialist economic system in the U.S.S.R. as a threat to the existence 
of the capitalist system. Accordingly, the imperialist governments did 
everything they could to bring new pressure to bear on the U.S.S.R., 
to create a feeling of uncertainty and uneasiness in the country, and to 
frustrate, or at least to impede, the industrialization of the U.S.S.R. 
In May 1927, the British Conservative Die-hards, then in office, 
organized a provocative raid on Arcos (the Soviet trading body in Great 
Britain). On May 26, 1927, the British Conservative Government 
broke off diplomatic and trade relations with the U.S.S.R. 
On June 7, 1927, Comrade Voikov, the Soviet Ambassador in 
Warsaw, was assassinated by a Russian Whiteguard, a naturalized Polish 
subject. 
About this time, too, in the U.S.S.R. itself, British spies and diversionists 
hurled bombs at a meeting in a Party club in Leningrad, wounding 
about 30 people, some of them severely. 
In the summer of 1927, almost simultaneous raids were made on 
the Soviet Embassies and Trade Representations in Berlin, Peking, 
Shanghai and Tientsin. 
This created additional difficulties for the Soviet Government.

283 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
But the U.S.S.R. refused to be intimidated and easily repulsed the 
provocative attempts of the imperialists and their agents. 
No less were the difficulties caused to the Party and the Soviet state 
by the subversive activities of the Trotskyites and other oppositionists. 
Comrade Stalin had good reason to say that ³something like a united 
front from Chamberlain to Trotsky is being formed² against the 
Soviet Government. In spite of the decisions of the Fourteenth Party 
Congress and the professions of loyalty of the oppositionists, the latter 
had not laid down their arms. On the contrary, they intensified their 
efforts to undermine and split the Party. 
In the summer of 1926, the Trotskyites and Zinovievites united to 
form an anti-Party bloc, made it a rallying point for the remnants of all 
the defeated opposition groups, and laid the foundation of their secret 
anti-Leninist party, thereby grossly violating the Party Rules and the 
decisions of Party congresses forbidding the formation of factions. The 
Central Committee of the Party gave warning that unless this anti- 
Party blocwhich resembled the notorious Menshevik August Bloc 
were dissolved, matters might end badly for its adherents. But the 
supporters of the bloc would not desist. 
That autumn, on the eve of the Fifteenth Party Conference, they 
made a sortie at Party meetings in the factories of Moscow, Leningrad 
and other cities, attempting to force a new discussion on the Party. The 
platform they tried to get the Party members to discuss was a rehash 
of the usual Trotskyite-Menshevik anti-Leninist platform. The Party 
members gave the oppositionists a severe rebuff, and in some places 
simply ejected them from the meetings. The Central Committee again 
warned the supporters of the bloc, stating that the Party could not 
tolerate their subversive activities any longer. 
The opposition then submitted to the Central Committee a statement 
signed by Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Sokolnikov condemning 
their own factional work and promising to be loyal in the future. 
Nevertheless, the bloc continued to exist and its adherents did not stop 
their underhand work against the Party. They went on banding together 
their anti-Leninist party, started an illegal printing press, collected 
membership dues from their supporters and circulated their platform. 
In view of the behaviour of the Trotskyites and Zinovievites, the 
Fifteenth Party Conference (November 1926) and the Enlarged 
Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International 
(December 1926) discussed the question of the bloc of Trotskyites and 
Zinovievites and adopted resolutions stigmatizing the adherents of this 
bloc as splitters whose platform was downright Menshevism.

NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
But even this failed to bring them to their senses. In 1927, just 
when the British Conservatives broke off diplomatic and trade relations 
with the U.S.S.R., the bloc attacked the Party with renewed vigour. 
It concocted a new anti-Leninist platform, the so-called ³Platform of 
the Eighty-Three² and began to circulate it among Party members, 
at the same time demanding that the Central Committee open a new 
general Party discussion. 
This was perhaps the most mendacious and pharisaical of all opposition 
platforms. 
In their platform, the Trotskyites and Zinovievites professed that 
they had no objection to observing Party decisions and that they were all 
in favour of loyalty, but in reality they grossly violated the Party decisions, 
and scoffed at the very idea of loyalty to the Party and to its Central 
Committee. 
In their platform, they professed they had no objection to Party 
unity and were against splits, but in reality they grossly violated Party 
unity, worked for a split, and already had their own, illegal, anti-Leninist 
party which had all the makings of an anti-Soviet, counter-revolutionary 
party. 
In their platform, they professed they were all in favour of the policy 
of industrialization, and even accused the Central Committee of not 
proceeding with industrialization fast enough, but in reality they did 
nothing but carp at the Party resolution on the victory of Socialism in 
the U.S.S.R., scoffed at the policy of Socialist industrialization, demanded 
the surrender of a number of mills and factories to foreigners 
in the form of concessions, and pinned their main hopes on foreign 
capitalist concessions in the U.S.S.R. 
In their platform, they professed they were all in favour of the 
collective-farm movement, and even accused the Central Committee of 
not proceeding with collectivization fast enough, but in reality they 
scoffed at the policy of enlisting the peasants in the work of Socialist 
construction, preached the idea that ³unresolvable conflicts² between 
the working class and the peasantry were inevitable, and pinned their 
hopes on the ³cultured leaseholders² in the countryside, in other words, 
on the kulaks. 
This was the most mendacious of all the platforms of the opposition. 
It was meant to deceive the Party. 
The Central Committee refused to open a general discussion immediately. 
It informed the opposition that a general discussion could be 
opened only in accordance with the Party Rules, namely, two months 
before a Party congress.

285 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
In October 1927, that is, two months before the Fifteenth Congress, 
the Central Committee of the Party announced a general Party discussion, 
and the fight began. Its result was truly lamentable for the 
bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites: 724,000 Party members voted 
for the policy of the Central Committee; 4,000, or less than one per 
cent, for the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites. The anti-Party bloc 
was completely routed. The overwhelming majority of the Party members 
were unanimous in rejecting the platform of the bloc. 
Such was the clearly expressed will of the Party, for whose judgment 
the oppositionists themselves had appealed. 
But even this lesson was lost on the supporters of the bloc. Instead 
of submitting to the will of the Party they decided to frustrate it. Even 
before the discussion had closed, perceiving that ignominious failure 
awaited them, they decided to resort to more acute forms of struggle 
against the Party and the Soviet Government and to stage an open 
demonstration of protest in Moscow and Leningrad. The day they 
chose for their demonstration was November 7, the anniversary of the 
October Revolution, the day on which the working people of the U.S.S.R. 
annually hold their countrywide revolutionary demonstration. Thus, 
the Trotskyites and Zinovievites planned to hold a parallel demonstration. 
As was to be expected, the supporters of the bloc managed to 
bring out into the streets only a miserable handful of their satellites. 
These satellites and their patrons were overwhelmed by the general 
demonstration and swept off the streets. 
Now there was no longer any doubt that the Trotskyites and Zinovievites 
had become definitely anti-Soviet. During the general Party 
discussion they had appealed to the Party against the Central Committee; 
now, during their puny demonstration, they had taken the course of 
appealing to the hostile classes against the Party and the Soviet state. 
Once they had made it their aim to undermine the Bolshevik Party, 
they were bound to go to the length of undermining the Soviet state, 
for in the Soviet Union the Bolshevik Party and the state are inseparable. 
That being the case, the ringleaders of the bloc of Trotskyites and 
Zinovievites had outlawed themselves from the Party, for men who had 
sunk to the depths of anti-Soviet action could no longer be tolerated in 
the ranks of the Bolshevik Party. 
On November 14, 1927, a joint meeting of the Central Committee 
and the Central Control Commission expelled Trotsky and Zinoviev 
from the Party.

2. PROGRESS OF SOCIALIST INDUSTRIALIZATION. AGRICULTURE 
LAGS. FIFTEENTH PARTY CONGRESS. POLICY OF COLLECTIVIZATION 
IN AGRICULTURE. ROUT OF THE BLOC OF TROTSKYITES 
AND ZINOVIEVITES. POLITICAL DUPLICITY 
By the end of 1927 the decisive success of the policy of Socialist 
industrialization was unmistakable. Under the New Economic Policy 
industrialization had made considerable progress in a short space of time. 
The gross output of industry and agriculture (including the timber industry 
and fisheries) had reached and even surpassed the pre-war level. 
Industrial output had risen to 42 per cent of the total output of the 
country, which was the pre-war ratio. 
The Socialist sector of industry was rapidly growing at the expense 
of the private sector, its output having risen from 81 per cent of the 
total output in 1924-25 to 86 per cent in 1926-27, the output of the 
private sector dropping from 19 per cent to 14 per cent in the same period. 
This meant that industrialization in the U.S.S.R. was of a pronounced 
Socialist character, that industry was developing towards the victory of 
the Socialist system of production, and that as far as industry was concerned, 
the question³Who will win?²had already been decided 
in favour of Socialism. 
No less rapid was the displacement of the private dealer in the sphere 
of trade, his share in the retail market having fallen from 42 per cent 
in 1924-25 to 32 per cent in 1926-27, not to mention the wholesale 
market, where the share of the private dealer had fallen from 9 per 
cent to 5 per cent in the same period. 
Even more rapid was the rate of growth of large-scale Socialist industry, 
which in 1927, the first year after the restoration period, 
increased its output over the previous year by 18 per cent. This was a 
record increase, one beyond the reach of the large-scale industry of even 
the most advanced capitalist countries. 
But in agriculture, especially grain growing, the picture was 
different. Although agriculture as a whole had passed the pre-war level, 
the gross yield of its most important branchgrain growingwas only 
91 per cent of pre-war, while the marketed share of the harvest, that 
is, the amount of grain sold for the supply of the towns, scarcely attained 
37 per cent of the pre-war figure. Furthermore, all the signs 
pointed to the danger of a further decline in the amount of marketable 
grain. 
This meant that the process of the splitting up of the large farms that 
used to produce for the market, into small farms, and of the small farms

287 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
into dwarf farms, a process which had begun in 1918, was still going on; 
that these small and dwarf peasant farms were reverting practically to a 
natural form of economy and were able to supply only a negligible quantity 
of grain for the market; that while in the 1927 period the grain 
crop was only slightly below that of the pre-war period, the marketable 
surplus for the supply of the towns was only a little more than one-third 
of the pre-war marketable surplus. 
There could be no doubt that if such a state of affairs in grain farming 
were to continue, the army and the urban population would be faced 
with chronic famine. 
This was a crisis in grain farming which was bound to be followed 
by a crisis in livestock farming. 
The only escape from this predicament was a change to large-scale 
farming which would permit the use of tractors and agricultural machines 
and secure a several-fold increase of the marketable surplus of 
grain. The country had the alternative: either to adopt large-scale 
capitalist farming, which would have meant the ruin of the peasant 
masses, destroyed the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, 
increased the strength of the kulaks, and led to the downfall of 
Socialism in the countryside; or to take the course of amalgamating the 
small peasant holdings into large Socialist farms, collective farms, which 
would be able to use tractors and other modern machines for a rapid 
advancement of grain farming and a rapid increase in the marketable 
surplus of gain. 
It is clear that the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state could only 
take the second course, the collective farm way of developing agriculture.
In this, the Party was guided by the following precepts of Lenin 
regarding the necessity of passing from small peasant farming to largescale, 
co-operative, collective farming: 
a) ³There is no escape from poverty for the small farm.² (Lenin, 
Selected Works, Vol. VIII, p. 195.) 
b) ³If we continue as of old on our small farms, even as free 
citizens on free land, we shall still be faced with inevitable ruin.² 
(Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. VI, p. 370.) 
c) ³If peasant farming is to develop further, we must firmly 
assure also its transition to the next stage, and this next stage must 
inevitably be one in which the small, isolated peasant farms, the 
least profitable and most backward, will by a process of gradual 
amalgamation form large-scale collective farms.² (Lenin, Selected 
Works, Vol. IX, p. 151.)

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 288 
d) ³Only if we succeed in proving to the peasants in practice 
the advantages of common, collective, co-operative, artel cultivation 
of the soil, only if we succeed in helping the peasant by means of 
co-operative or artel farming, will the working class, which holds 
the state power, be really able to convince the peasant of the correctness 
of its policy and to secure the real and durable following 
of the millions of peasants.² (Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. VIII, 
p. 198.) 
Such was the situation prior to the Fifteenth Party Congress. 
The Fifteenth Party Congress opened on December 2, 1927. It 
was attended by 898 delegates with vote and 771 delegates with voice 
but no vote, representing 887,233 Party members and 348,957 candidate 
members. 
In his report on behalf of the Central Committee, Comrade Stalin 
referred to the good results of industrialization and the rapid expansion 
of Socialist industry, and set the Party the following task: 
³To extend and consolidate our Socialist key position in all 
economic branches in town and country and to pursue a course of 
eliminating the capitalist elements from the national economy.² 
Comparing agriculture with industry and noting the backwardness 
of the former, especially of grain growing, owing to the scattered state of 
agriculture, which precluded the use of modern machinery, Comrade 
Stalin emphasized that such an unenviable state of agriculture was endangering 
the entire national economy. 
³What is the way out?² Comrade Stalin asked. 
³The way out,² he said, ³is to turn the small and scattered peasant 
farms into large united farms based on the common cultivation 
of the soil, to introduce collective cultivation of the soil on the basis 
of a new and higher technique. The way out is to unite the small 
and dwarf peasant farms gradually but surely, not by pressure, but 
by example and persuasion, into large farms based on common, cooperative, 
collective cultivation of the soil with the use of agricultural 
machines and tractors and scientific methods of intensive agriculture. 
There is no other way out.² 
The Fifteenth Congress passed a resolution calling for the fullest 
development of collectivization in agriculture. The congress adopted a 
plan for the extension and consolidation of the collective farms and state 
farms and formulated explicit instructions concerning the methods to be 
used in the struggle for collectivization in agriculture.

289 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
At the same time, the congress gave directions: 
³To develop further the offensive against the kulaks and to adopt 
a number of new measures which would restrict the development of 
capitalism in the countryside and guide peasant farming towards 
Socialism.² (Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.], Russ. ed., Part II, 
p. 260.) 
Finally, in view of the fact that economic planning had taken firm 
root, and with the object of organizing a systematic offensive of Socialism 
against the capitalist elements along the entire economic front, the congress 
gave instructions to the proper bodies for the drawing up of the 
First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. 
After passing decisions on the problems of Socialist construction, the 
congress proceeded to discuss the question of liquidating the bloc of 
Trotskyites and Zinovievites. 
The congress recognized that ³the opposition has ideologically 
broken with Leninism, has degenerated into a Menshevik group, has 
taken the course of capitulation to the forces of the international and 
home bourgeoisie, and has objectively become a tool of counter-revolution 
against the regime of the proletarian dictatorship.² (Ibid., p. 232.) 
The congress found that the differences between the Party and the 
opposition had developed into differences of program, and that the Trotsky 
opposition had taken the course of struggle against the Soviet 
power. The congress therefore declared that adherence to the Trotsky 
opposition and the propagation of its views were incompatible with membership 
of the Bolshevik Party. 
The congress approved the decision of the joint meeting of the 
Central Committee and the Central Control Commission to expel Trotsky 
and Zinoviev from the Party and resolved on the expulsion of all 
active members of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites, such as 
Radek, Preobrazhensky, Rakovsky, Pyatakov, Serebryakov, I. Smirnov, 
Kamenev, Sarkis, Safarov, Lifshitz, Mdivani, Smilga and the whole 
³Democratic-Centralism² group (Sapronov, V. Smirnov, Boguslavsky, 
Drobnis and others). 
Defeated ideologically and routed organizationally, the adherents 
of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites lost the last vestiges of their 
influence among the people. 
Shortly after the Fifteenth Party Congress, the expelled anti-Leninists 
began to hand in statements, recanting Trotskyism and asking to 
be reinstated in the Party. Of course, at that time the Party could 
not yet know that Trotsky, Rakovsky, Radek, Krestinsky, Sokolnikov

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 290 
and others had long been enemies of the people, spies recruited by foreign 
espionage services, and that Kamenev, Zinoviev, Pyatakov and others 
were already forming connections with enemies of the U.S.S.R. in 
capitalist countries for the purpose of ³collaboration² with them against 
the Soviet people. But experience had taught the Party that any knavery 
might be expected from these individuals, who had often attacked Lenin 
and the Leninist Party at the most crucial moments. It was therefore 
sceptical of the statements they had made in their applications for reinstatement. 
As a preliminary test of their sincerity, it made their reinstatement 
in the Party dependent on the following conditions: 
a) They must publicly denounce Trotskyism as an anti-Bolshevik 
and anti-Soviet ideology. 
b) They must publicly acknowledge the Party policy as the only 
correct policy. 
c) They must unconditionally abide by the decisions of the Party 
and its bodies. 
d) They must undergo a term of probation, during which the Party 
would test them; on the expiration of this term, the Party would consider 
the reinstatement of each applicant separately, depending on the 
results of the test. 
The Party considered that in any case the public acceptance of these 
points by the expelled would be all to the good of the Party, because 
it would break the unity of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite ranks, undermine 
their morale, demonstrate once more the right and the might of the 
Party, and enable the Party, if the applicants were sincere, to reinstate 
its former workers in its ranks, and if they were not sincere, to unmask 
them in the public eye, no longer as misguided individuals, but as unprincipled 
careerists, deceivers of the working class and incorrigible 
double-dealers. 
The majority of the expelled accepted the terms of reinstatement 
and made public statements in the press to this effect. 
Desiring to be clement to them, and loath to deny them an opportunity 
of once again becoming men of the Party and of the working 
class, the Party reinstated them in its ranks. 
However, time showed that, with few exceptions, the recantations 
of the ³leading lights² of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites were 
false and hypocritical from beginning to end. 
It turned out that even before they had handed in their applications, 
these gentry had ceased to represent a political trend ready to defend 
their views before the people, and had become an unprincipled gang of 
careerists who were prepared publicly to trample on the last remnants

291 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
of their own views, publicly to praise the views of the Party, which were 
alien to them, andlike chameleonsto adopt any colouring, provided 
they could maintain themselves in the ranks of the Party and the working 
class and have the opportunity to do harm to the working class and 
to its Party. 
The ³leading lights² of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites 
proved to be political swindlers, political double-dealers. 
Political double-dealers usually begin with deceit and prosecute their 
nefarious ends by deceiving the people, the working class, and the Party 
of the working class. But political double-dealers are not to be regarded 
as mere humbugs. Political double-dealers are an unprincipled gang of 
political careerists who, having long ago lost the confidence of the 
people, strive to insinuate themselves once more into their confidence 
by deception, by chameleon-like changes of colour, by fraud, by any 
means, only that they might retain the title of political figures. Political 
double-dealers are an unprincipled gang of political careerists who are 
ready to seek support anywhere, even among criminal elements, even 
among the scum of society, even among the mortal enemies of the people, 
only that they might be able, at a ³propitious² moment, again to 
mount the political stage and to clamber on to the back of the people 
as their ³rulers.² 
The ³leading lights² of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites 
were political double-dealers of this very description. 
3. OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE KULAKS. THE BUKHARIN-RYKOV 
ANTI-PARTY GROUP. ADOPTION OF THE FIRST FIVE-YEAR 
PLAN. SOCIALIST EMULATION. BEGINNING OF THE MASS 
COLLECTIVE-FARM MOVEMENT 
The agitation conducted by the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites 
against the Party policy, against the building of Socialism, and against 
collectivization, as well as the agitation conducted by the Bukharinites, 
who said that nothing would come of the collective farms, that the kulaks 
should be let alone because they would ³grow² into Socialism of themselves, 
and that the enrichment of the bourgeoisie represented no danger 
to Socialismall found an eager response among the capitalist elements 
in the country, and above all among the kulaks. The kulaks now knew 
from comments in the press that they were not alone, that they had 
defenders and intercessors in the persons of Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, 
Bukharin, Rykov and others. Naturally, this could not but stiffen the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 292 
kulaks¹ spirit of resistance against the policy of the Soviet Government. 
And, in fact, the resistance of the kulaks became increasingly stubborn. 
They refused en masse to sell to the Soviet state their grain surpluses, 
of which they had considerable hoards. They resorted to terrorism 
against the collective farmers, against Party workers and government 
officials in the countryside, and burned down collective farms and state 
granaries. 
The Party realized that until the resistance of the kulaks was broken, 
until they were defeated in open fight in full view of the peasantry, the 
working class and the Red Army would suffer from a food shortage, 
and the movement for collectivization among the peasants could not 
assume a mass character. 
In pursuance of the instructions of the Fifteenth Party Congress, 
the Party launched a determined offensive against the kulaks, putting 
into effect the slogan: rely firmly on the poor peasantry, strengthen 
the alliance with the middle peasantry, and wage a resolute struggle 
against the kulaks. In answer to the kulaks¹ refusal to sell their grain 
surpluses to the state at the fixed prices, the Party and the Government 
adopted a number of emergency measures against the kulaks, applied 
Article 107 of the Criminal Code empowering the courts to confiscate 
grain surpluses from kulaks and profiteers in case they refused to sell 
them to the state at the fixed prices, and granted the poor peasants a 
number of privileges, under which 25 per cent of the confiscated kulak 
grain was placed at their disposal. 
These emergency measures had their effect: the poor and middle 
peasants joined in the resolute fight against the kulaks; the kulaks were 
isolated, and the resistance of the kulaks and the profiteers was broken. 
By the end of 1928, the Soviet state already had sufficient stocks of grain 
at its disposal, and the collective-farm movement began to advance with 
surer strides. 
That same year, a large organization of wreckers, consisting of 
bourgeois experts, was discovered in the Shakhty district of the Donetz 
Coal Basin. The Shakhty wreckers were closely connected with the 
former mine ownersRussian and foreign capitalistsand with a foreign 
military espionage service. Their aim was to disrupt the development 
of Socialist industry and to facilitate the restoration of capitalism in the 
U.S.S.R. The wreckers had deliberately mismanaged the mines in order 
to reduce the output of coal, spoiled machinery and ventilation apparatus, 
caused roof-falls and explosions, and set fire to pits, plants and powerstations. 
The wreckers had deliberately obstructed the improvement of the 
workers¹ conditions and had infringed the Soviet labour protection laws.

293 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
The wreckers were put on trial and met with their deserts. 
The Central Committee of the Party directed all Party organizations 
to draw the necessary conclusions from the Shakhty case. Comrade 
Stalin declared that Bolshevik business executives must themselves become 
experts in the technique of production, so as no longer to be the dupes 
of the wreckers among the old bourgeois experts, and that the training 
of new technical personnel from the ranks of the working class must 
be accelerated. 
In accordance with a decision of the Central Committee, the training 
of young experts in the technical colleges was improved. Thousands 
of Party members, members of the Young Communist League and non- 
Party people devoted to the cause of the working class were mobilized 
for study. 
Before the Party took the offensive against the kulaks, and while it 
was engaged in liquidating the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites, the 
Bukharin-Rykov group had been more or less lying low, holding themselves 
as a reserve of the anti-Party forces, not venturing to support the 
Trotskyites openly, and sometimes even acting together with the Party 
against the Trotskyites. But when the Party assumed the offensive 
against the kulaks, and adopted emergency measures against them, the 
Bukharin-Rykov group threw off their mask and began to attack the Party 
policy openly. The kulak soul of the Bukharin-Rykov group got the 
better of them, and they began to come out openly in defence of the 
kulaks. They demanded the repeal of the emergency measures, frightening 
the simple-minded with the argument that otherwise agriculture 
would begin to ³decay,² and even affirming that this process had already 
begun. Blind to the growth of the collective farms and state farms, 
those superior forms of agricultural organization, and perceiving the 
decline of kulak farming, they represented the decay of the latter as 
the decay of agriculture. In order to provide a theoretical backing 
for their case, they concocted the absurd ³theory of the subsidence of 
the class-struggle,² maintaining, on the strength of this theory, that 
the class struggle would grow milder with every victory gained by 
Socialism against the capitalist elements, that the class struggle would 
soon subside altogether and the class enemy would surrender all his 
positions without a fight, and that, consequently, there was no need for 
an offensive against the kulaks. In this way they tried to furbish up 
their threadbare bourgeois theory that the kulaks would peaceably grow 
into Socialism, and rode roughshod over the well-known thesis of Leninism 
that the resistance of the class enemy would assume more acute 
forms as the progress of Socialism cut the ground from under his feet

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 294 
and that the class struggle could ³subside² only after the class enemy 
was destroyed. 
It was easy to see that in the Bukharin-Rykov group the Party was 
faced with a group of Right opportunists who differed from the bloc 
of Trotskyites and Zinovievites only in form, only in the fact that the 
Trotskyite and Zinovievite capitulators had had some opportunity of 
masking their true nature with Left, revolutionary vociferations about 
³permanent revolution,² whereas the Bukharin-Rykov group, attacking 
the Party as they did for taking the offensive against the kulaks, could 
not possibly mask their capitulatory character and had to defend the 
reactionary forces in our country, the kulaks in particular, openly, without 
mask or disguise. 
The Party understood that sooner or later the Bukharin-Rykov 
group was bound to join hands with the remnants of the bloc of Trotskyites 
and Zinovievites for common action against the Party. 
Parallel with their political pronouncements, the Bukharin-Rykov 
group ³worked² to muster and organize their following. Through 
Bukharin, they banded together young bourgeois elements like Slepkov, 
Maretsky, Eichenwald, Goldenberg; through Tomskyhigh bureaucrats 
in the trade unions (Melnichansky, Dogadov and others); through 
Rykovdemoralized high Soviet officials (A. Smirnov, Eismont, 
V. Schmidt, and others). The group readily attracted people who had 
degenerated politically, and who made no secret of their capitulatory 
sentiments. 
About this time the Bukharin-Rykov group gained the support of 
high functionaries in the Moscow Party organization (Uglanov, Kotov, 
Ukhanov, Ryutin, Yagoda, Polonsky, and others). A section of the 
Rights kept under cover, abstaining from open attacks on the Party 
line. In the Moscow Party press and at Party meetings, it was advocated 
that concessions must be made to the kulaks, that heavy taxation of 
kulaks was inadvisable, that industrialization was burdensome to the 
people, and that the development of heavy industry was premature. 
Uglanov opposed the Dnieper hydro-electric scheme and demanded that 
funds be diverted from heavy industry to the light industries. Uglanov 
and the other Right capitulators maintained that Moscow was and 
would remain a gingham city, and that there was no need to build 
engineering works in Moscow. 
The Moscow Party organization unmasked Uglanov and his followers, 
gave them a final warning and rallied closer than ever around the 
Central Committee of the Party. At a plenary meeting of the Moscow 
Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.), held in 1928, Comrade Stalin said

295 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
that a fight must be waged on two fronts, with the fire concentrated on 
the Right deviation. The Rights, Comrade Stalin said, were kulak agents 
inside the Party. 
³The triumph of the Right deviation in our Party would unleash 
the forces of capitalism, undermine the revolutionary position 
of the proletariat and increase the chances of restoring capitalism in 
our country,² said Comrade Stalin. (Stalin, Leninism, Vol. II.) 
At the beginning of 1929 it was discovered that Bukharin, authorized 
by the group of Right capitulators, had formed connections with the 
Trotskyites, through Kamenev, and was negotiating an agreement with 
them for a joint struggle against the Party. The Central Committee 
exposed these criminal activities of the Right capitulators and warned 
them that this affair might end lamentably for Bukharin, Rykov, Tomsky 
and the rest. But the Right capitulators would not heed the warning. 
At a meeting of the Central Committee they advanced a new anti- 
Party platform, in the form of a declaration, which the Central Committee 
condemned. It warned them again, reminding them of what 
had happened to the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites. In spite of 
this, the Bukharin-Rykov group persisted in their anti-Party activities. 
Rykov, Tomsky and Bukharin tendered to the Central Committee their 
resignations, believing that they would intimidate the Party thereby. 
The Central Committee passed condemnation on this saboteur policy 
of resignations. Finally, a plenum of the Central Committee, held in 
November 1929, declared that the propaganda of the views of the 
Right opportunists was incompatible with membership of the Party; 
it resolved that Bukharin, as the instigator and leader of the Right 
capitulators, be removed from the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee, and issued a grave warning to Rykov, Tomsky and other 
members of the Right opposition. 
Perceiving that matters had taken a lamentable turn, the chieftains 
of the Right capitulators submitted a statement acknowledging their 
errors and the correctness of the political line of the Party. 
The Right capitulators decided to effect a temporary retreat so as 
to preserve their ranks from debacle. 
This ended the first stage of the Party¹s fight against the Right 
capitulators. 
The new differences within the Party did not escape the attention 
of the external enemies of the Soviet Union. Believing that the ³new 
dissensions² in the Party were a sign of its weakness, they made a new 
attempt to involve the U.S.S.R. in war and to thwart the work of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 296 
industrialization before it had got properly under way. In the summer 
of 1929, the imperialists provoked a conflict between China and the 
Soviet Union, and instigated the seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway 
(which belonged to the U.S.S.R.) by the Chinese militarists, and 
an attack on our Far-Eastern frontier by troops of the Chinese Whites. 
But this raid of the Chinese militarists was promptly liquidated, the 
militarists, routed by the Red Army, retreated and the conflict ended 
in the signing of a peace agreement with the Manchurian authorities. 
The peace policy of the U.S.S.R. once more triumphed in the face 
of all obstacles, notwithstanding the intrigues of external enemies and 
the ³dissensions² within the Party. 
Soon after this diplomatic and trade relations between the U.S.S.R. 
and Great Britain, which had been severed by the British Conservatives, 
were resumed. 
While successfully repulsing the attacks of the external and internal 
enemies, the Party was busily engaged in developing heavy industry, 
organizing Socialist emulation, building up state farms and collective 
farms, and, lastly, preparing the ground for the adoption and execution 
of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. 
In April 1929, the Party held its Sixteenth Conference, with the 
First Five-Year Plan as the main item on the agenda. The conference 
rejected the ³minimal² variant of the Five-Year Plan advocated by the 
Right capitulators and adopted the ³optimal² variant as binding under 
all circumstances. 
Thus, the Party adopted the celebrated First Five-Year Plan for 
the construction of Socialism. 
The Five-Year-Plan fixed the volume of capital investments in the 
national economy in the period 1928-33 at 64,600,000,000 rubles. Of 
this sum, 19,500,000,000 rubles were to be invested in industrial and 
electric-power development, 10,000,000,000 rubles in transport development 
and 23,200,000,000 rubles in agriculture. 
This was a colossal plan for the equipment of industry and agriculture 
of the U.S.S.R. with modern technique. 
³The fundamental task of the Five-Year Plan,² said Comrade 
Stalin, ³was to create such an industry in our country as would be 
able to re-equip and reorganize, not only the whole of industry, 
but also transport and agricultureon the basis of Socialism.² 
(Stalin, Problems of Leninism, Russ. ed., p. 485.) 
For all the immensity of this plan, it did not nonplus or surprise the 
Bolsheviks. The way for it had been prepared by the whole course of

297 1 9 2 6 - 1 9 2 9 
development of industrialization and collectivization and it had been 
preceded by a wave of labour enthusiasm which caught up the workers 
and peasants and which found expression in Socialist emulation. 
The Sixteenth Party Conference adopted an appeal to all working 
people, calling for the further development of Socialist emulation. 
Socialist emulation had produced many an instance of exemplary 
labour and of a new attitude to labour. In many factories, collective 
farms and state farms, the workers and collective farmers drew up 
counter-plans for an output exceeding that provided for in the state 
plans. They displayed heroism in labour. They not only fulfilled, but 
exceeded the plans of Socialist development laid down by the Party and 
the Government. The attitude to labour had changed. From the involuntary 
and penal servitude it had been under capitalism, it was becoming 
³a matter of honour, a matter of glory, a matter of valour 
and heroism.² (Stalin.) 
New industrial construction on a gigantic scale was in progress all 
over the country. The Dnieper hydro-electric scheme was in full swing. 
Construction work on the Kramatorsk and Gorlovka Iron and Steel 
Works and the reconstruction of the Lugansk Locomotive Works had 
begun in the Donetz Basin. New collieries and blast furnaces came into 
being. The Urals Machine-Building Works and the Berezniki and 
Solikamsk Chemical Works were under construction in the Urals. Work 
was begun on the construction of the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk. 
The erection of big automobile plants in Moscow and Gorky 
was well under way, as was the construction of giant tractor plants, 
harvester combine plants, and a mammoth agricultural machinery plant 
in Rostov-on-Don. The Kuznetsk collieries, the Soviet Union¹s second 
coal base, were being extended. An immense tractor works sprang up 
in the steppe near Stalingrad in the space of eleven months. In the 
erection of the Dnieper Hydro-Electric Station and the Stalingrad Tractor 
Works, the workers beat world records in productivity of labour. 
History had never known industrial construction on such a gigantic 
scale, such enthusiasm for new development, such labour heroism on 
the part of the working-class millions. 
It was a veritable upsurge of labour enthusiasm, produced and 
stimulated by Socialist emulation. 
This time the peasants did not lag behind the workers. In the 
countryside, too, this labour enthusiasm began to spread among the 
peasant masses who were organizing their collective farms. The peasants 
definitely began to turn to collective farming. In this a great part was 
played by the state farms and the machine and tractor stations. The

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 298 
peasants would come in crowds to the state farms and machine and 
tractor stations to watch the operation of the tractors and other agricultural 
machines, admire their performance and there and then resolve: 
³Let¹s join the collective farm.² Divided and disunited, each on his 
tiny, dwarf individually-run farm, destitute of anything like serviceable 
implements or traction, having no way of breaking up large tracts of 
virgin soil, without prospect of any improvement on their farms, crushed 
by poverty, isolated and left to their own devices, the peasants had at 
last found a way out, an avenue to a better life, in the amalgamation 
of their small farms into co-operative undertakings, collective farms; in 
tractors, which are able to break up any ³hard ground,² any virgin soil; 
in the assistance rendered by the state in the form of machines, money, 
men, and counsel; in the opportunity to free themselves from bondage 
to the kulaks, who had been quite recently defeated by the Soviet Government 
and forced to the ground, to the joy of the millions of peasants. 
On this basis began the mass collective-farm movement, which later 
developed rapidly, especially towards the end of 1929, progressing at 
an unprecedented rate, a rate unknown even to our Socialist industry. 
In 1928 the total crop area of the collective farms was 1,390,000 
hectares, in 1929 it was 4,262,000 hectares, while in 1930 the ploughing 
plan of the collective farms was already 15,000,000 hectares. 
³It must be admitted,² said Comrade Stalin in his article, 
³A Year of Great Change² (1929), in reference to the collective 
farms, ³that such an impetuous speed of development is unequalled 
even in our socialized large-scale industry, which in general is noted 
for its outstanding speed of development.² 
This was a turning point in the development of the collective-farm 
movement. 
This was the beginning of a mass collective-farm movement. 
³What is the new feature of the present collective-farm movement?² 
asked Comrade Stalin in his article, ³A Year of Great 
Change.² And he answered: 
³The new and decisive feature of the present collective-farm 
movement is that the peasants are joining the collective farms not 
in separate groups, as was formerly the case, but in whole villages, 
whole volosts (rural districts), whole districts and even whole areas. 
And what does that mean? It means that the middle peasant has 
joined the collective-farm movement. And that is the basis of that 
radical change in the development of agriculture which represents 
the most important achievement of the Soviet Government. . . .²

This meant that the time was becoming ripe, or had already become 
ripe, for the elimination of the kulaks as a class, on the basis of solid 
collectivization. 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
During the period 1926-29, the Party grappled with and overcame 
immense difficulties on the home and foreign fronts in the fight for the 
Socialist industrialization of the country. The efforts of the Party and 
the working class ended in the victory of the policy of Socialist industrialization. 
In the main, one of the most difficult problems of industrialization 
had been solved, namely, the problem of accumulating funds for the 
building of a heavy industry. The foundations were laid of a heavy 
industry capable of re-equipping the entire national economy. 
The First Five-Year Plan of Socialist construction was adopted. The 
building of new factories, state farms and collective farms was developed 
on a vast scale. 
This advance towards Socialism was attended by a sharpening of 
the class struggle in the country and a sharpening of the struggle 
within the Party. The chief results of this struggle were that the resistance 
of the kulaks was crushed, the bloc of Trotskyite and Zinovievite 
capitulators was exposed as an anti-Soviet bloc, the Right capitulators 
were exposed as agents of the kulaks, the Trotskyites were expelled from 
the Party, and the views of the Trotskyites and the Right opportunists 
were declared incompatible with membership of the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
Defeated ideologically by the Bolshevik Party, and having lost all 
support among the working class, the Trotskyites ceased to be a political 
trend and became an unprincipled, careerist clique of political swindlers, 
a gang of political double-dealers. 
Having laid the foundations of a heavy industry, the Party mustered 
the working class and the peasantry for the fulfilment of the First Five- 
Year Plan for the Socialist reconstruction of the U.S.S.R. Socialist 
emulation developed all over the country among millions of working 
people, giving rise to a mighty wave of labour enthusiasm and originating 
a new labour discipline. 
This period ended with a year of great change, signalized by sweeping 
victories of Socialism in industry, the first important successes in 
agriculture, the swing of the middle peasant towards the collective farms, 
and the beginning of a mass collective-farm movement.

FOR THE COLLECTIVIZATION OF 
AGRICULTURE 
( 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 ) 
1. INTERNATIONAL SITUATION IN 1930-34. ECONOMIC CRISIS IN 
THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES. JAPANESE ANNEXATION OF MANCHURIA. 
FASCISTS¹ ADVENT TO POWER IN GERMANY. TWO 
SEATS OF WAR 
While in the U.S.S.R. important progress had been made in the 
Socialist industrialization of the country and industry was rapidly developing, 
in the capitalist countries a devastating world economic crisis of 
unprecedented dimensions had broken out at the end of 1929 and grew 
steadily more acute in the three following years. The industrial crisis was 
interwoven with an agrarian crisis, which made matters still worse for 
the capitalist countries. 
In the three years of economic crisis (1930-33), industrial output 
in the U.S.A. had sunk to 65 per cent, in Great Britain to 86 per cent, 
in Germany to 66 per cent and in France to 77 per cent of the 1929 
output. Yet in this same period industrial output in the U.S.S.R. more 
than doubled, amounting in 1933 to 201 per cent of the 1929 output. 
This was but an additional proof of the superiority of the Socialist 
economic system over the capitalist economic system. It showed that 
the country of Socialism is the only country in the world which is exempt 
from economic crises. 
The world economic crisis condemned 24,000,000 unemployed to 
starvation, poverty and misery. The agrarian crisis brought suffering 
to tens of millions of peasants. 
The world economic crisis further aggravated the contradictions between 
the imperialist states, between the victor countries and the vanquished 
countries, between the imperialist states and the colonial and 
dependent countries, between the workers and the capitalists, between 
the peasants and the landlords. 
In his report on behalf of the Central Committee to the Sixteenth 
Party Congress, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the bourgeoisie would 
seek a way out of the economic crisis, on the one hand, by crushing the 
300

301 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
working class through the establishment of fascist dictatorship, i.e., the 
dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, most imperialistic 
capitalist elements, and, on the other hand, by fomenting war for the redivision 
of colonies and spheres of influence at the expense of the poorly 
defended countries. 
That is just what happened. 
In 1932 the war danger was aggravated by Japan. Perceiving that, 
owing to the economic crisis, the European powers and the U.S.A. 
were wholly engrossed in their domestic affairs, the Japanese imperialists 
decided to seize the opportunity and bring pressure to bear on poorly 
defended China, in an attempt to subjugate her and to lord it over the 
country. Unscrupulously exploiting ³local incidents² they themselves 
had provoked, the Japanese imperialists, like robbers, without declaring 
war on China, marched their troops into Manchuria. The Japanese 
soldiery seized the whole of Manchuria, thereby preparing a convenient 
place d¹armes for the conquest of North China and for an attack on the 
U.S.S.R. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in order to leave 
her hands free, and began to arm at a feverish pace. 
This impelled the U.S.A., Britain and France to strengthen their 
naval armaments in the Far East. It was obvious that Japan was out 
to subjugate China and to eject the European and American imperialist 
powers from that country. They replied by increasing their armaments. 
But Japan was pursuing another purpose, too, namely, to seize the 
Soviet Far East. Naturally, the U.S.S.R. could not shut its eyes to this 
danger, and began intensively to strengthen the defences of its Far 
Eastern territory. 
Thus, in the Far East, thanks to the Japanese fascist imperialists, 
there arose the first seat of war. 
But it was not only in the Far East that the economic crisis aggravated 
the contradictions of capitalism. It aggravated them in Europe 
too. The prolonged crisis in industry and agriculture, the huge volume 
of unemployment, and the growing insecurity of the poorer classes fanned 
the discontent of the workers and peasants. The discontent of the 
working class grew into revolutionary disaffection. This was particularly 
the case in Germany, which was economically exhausted by the war, 
by the payment of reparations to the Anglo-French victors, and by 
the economic crisis, and the working class of which languished under 
a double yoke, that of the home and the foreign, the British and 
French, bourgeoisie. The extent of this discontent was clearly indicated 
by the six million votes cast for the German Communist Party at the 
last Reichstag elections, before the fascists came to power. The German

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 302 
bourgeoisie perceived that the bourgeois-democratic liberties preserved in 
Germany might play them an evil trick, that the working class might 
use these liberties to extend the revolutionary movement. They therefore 
decided that there was only one way of maintaining the power of the 
bourgeoisie in Germany, and that was to abolish the bourgeois liberties, 
to reduce the Reichstag to a cipher, and to establish a terrorist bourgeoisnationalist 
dictatorship, which would be able to suppress the working 
class and base itself on the petty-bourgeois masses who wanted to 
revenge Germany¹s defeat in the war. And so they called to power the 
fascist partywhich in order to hoodwink the people calls itself the 
National-Socialist Partywell knowing that the fascist party, first, 
represents that section of the imperialist bourgeoisie which is the most 
reactionary and most hostile to the working class, and, secondly, that 
it is the most pronounced party of revenge, one capable of beguiling the 
millions of the nationalistically minded petty bourgeoisie. In this they 
were assisted by the traitors to the working class, the leaders of the 
German Social-Democratic Party, who paved the way for fascism by 
their policy of compromise. 
These were the conditions which brought about the accession to 
power of the German fascists in 1933. 
Analysing the events in Germany in his report to the Seventeenth 
Party Congress, Comrade Stalin said: 
³The victory of fascism in Germany must be regarded not only 
as a symptom of the weakness of the working class and a result of 
the betrayals of the working class by the Social-Democratic Party, 
which paved the way for fascism; it must also be regarded as a 
symptom of the weakness of the bourgeoisie, of the fact that the 
bourgeoisie is already unable to rule by the old methods of parliamentarism 
and bourgeois democracy, and, as a consequence, is compelled 
in its home policy to resort to terroristic methods of rule. . . .² 
(J. Stalin, Seventeenth Congress of the C.P.S.U., ³Report on the 
Work of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.[B.],² p. 17.) 
The German fascists inaugurated their home policy by setting fire 
to the Reichstag, brutally suppressing the working class, destroying its 
organizations, and abolishing the bourgeois-democratic liberties. They 
inaugurated their foreign policy by withdrawing from the League of 
Nations and openly preparing for a war for the forcible revision of the 
frontiers of the European states to the advantage of Germany. 
Thus, in the centre of Europe, thanks to the German fascists, there 
arose a second seat of war.

303 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
Naturally, the U.S.S.R. could not shut its eyes to so serious a fact, 
and began to keep a sharp watch on the course of events in the West 
and to strengthen its defences on the Western frontiers. 
2. FROM THE POLICY OF RESTRICTING THE KULAK ELEMENTS 
TO THE POLICY OF ELIMINATING THE KULAKS AS A CLASS. 
STRUGGLE AGAINST DISTORTIONS OF THE PARTY POLICY IN 
THE COLLECTIVE-FARM MOVEMENT. OFFENSIVE AGAINST 
THE CAPITALIST ELEMENTS ALONG THE WHOLE LINE. SIXTEENTH 
PARTY CONGRESS 
The mass influx of the peasants into the collective farms in 1929 
and 1930 was a result of the whole preceding work of the Party and 
the Government. The growth of Socialist industry, which had begun 
the mass production of tractors and machines for agriculture; the vigorous 
measures taken against the kulaks during the grain-purchasing 
campaigns of 1928 and 1929; the spread of agricultural co-operative 
societies, which gradually accustomed the peasants to collective farming; 
the good results obtained by the first collective farms and state farms 
all this prepared the way for solid collectivization, when the peasants 
of entire villages, districts and regions joined the collective farms. 
Solid collectivization was not just a peaceful processthe overwhelming 
bulk of the peasantry simply joining the collective farmsbut 
was a struggle of the peasant masses against the kulaks. Solid collectivization 
meant that all the land in a village area in which a collective 
farm was formed passed into the hands of the collective farm; but a 
considerable portion of this land was held by the kulaks, and therefore 
the peasants would expropriate them, driving them from the land, dispossessing 
them of their cattle and machinery and demanding their 
arrest and eviction from the district by the Soviet authorities. 
Solid collectivization therefore meant the elimination of the kulaks. 
This was a policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class, on the basis 
of solid collectivization. 
By this time, the U.S.S.R. had a strong enough material base to 
allow it to put an end to the kulaks, break their resistance, eliminate 
them as a class and replace kulak farming by collective and state farming. 
In 1927 the kulaks still produced over 600,000,000 poods of grain, 
of which about 130,000,000 poods were available for sale. In that 
year the collective and state farms had only 35,000,000 poods of grain 
available for sale. In 1929, thanks to the Bolshevik Party¹s firm policy

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 304 
of developing state farms and collective farms, and likewise to the progress 
made by Socialist industry in supplying the countryside with tractors and 
agricultural machinery, the collective farms and state farms had become 
an important factor. In that year the collective farms and state farms 
already produced no less than 400,000,000 poods of grain, of which 
over 130,000,000 poods were marketed. This was more than the 
kulaks had marketed in 1927. And in 1930 the collective farms and 
state farms were to produce, and actually did produce, over 400,000,000 
poods of grain for the market, which was incomparably more than had 
been marketed by the kulaks in 1927. 
Thus, thanks to the changed alignment of class forces in the economic 
life of the country, and the existence of the necessary material base for 
the replacement of the kulak grain output by that of the collective and 
state farms, the Bolshevik Party was able to proceed from the policy of 
restricting the kulaks to a new policy, the policy of eliminating them as 
a class, on the basis of solid collectivization. 
Prior to 1929, the Soviet Government had pursued a policy of 
restricting the kulaks. It had imposed higher taxes on the kulak, and 
had required him to sell grain to the state at fixed prices; by the law on 
the renting of land it had to a certain extent restricted the amount of land 
he could use; by the law on the employment of hired labour on private 
farms it had limited the scope of his farm. But it had not yet pursued 
a policy of eliminating the kulaks, since the laws on the renting of land 
and the hiring of labour allowed them to carry on, while the prohibition 
of their expropriation gave them a certain guarantee in this respect. The 
effect of this policy was to arrest the growth of the kulak class, some 
sections of which, unable to withstand the pressure of these restrictions, 
were forced out of business and ruined. But this policy did not destroy 
the economic foundations of the kulaks as a class, nor did it tend to 
eliminate them. It was a policy of restricting the kulaks, not of eliminating 
them. This policy was essential up to a certain time, that is, as long 
as the collective farms and state farms were still weak and unable to 
replace the kulaks in the production of grain. 
At the end of 1929, with the growth of the collective farms and 
state farms, the Soviet Government turned sharply from this policy to 
the policy of eliminating the kulaks, of destroying them as a class. It 
repealed the laws on the renting of land and the hiring of labour, thus, 
depriving the kulaks both of land and of hired labourers. It lifted the ban 
on the expropriation of the kulaks. It permitted the peasants to confiscate 
cattle, machines and other farm property from the kulaks for the benefit 
of the collective farms. The kulaks were expropriated. They were expro

305 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
priated just as the capitalists had been expropriated in the sphere of industry 
in 1918, with this difference, however, that the kulaks¹ means of 
production did not pass into the hands of the state, but into the hands of 
the peasants united in the collective farms. 
This was a profound revolution, a leap from an old qualitative state 
of society to a new qualitative state, equivalent in its consequences to the 
revolution of October 1917. 
The distinguishing feature of this revolution is that it was accomplished 
from above, on the initiative of the state, and directly supported 
from below by the millions of peasants, who were fighting to throw off 
kulak bondage and to live in freedom in the collective farms. 
This revolution, at one blow, solved three fundamental problems of 
Socialist construction: 
a) It eliminated the most numerous class of exploiters in our country, 
the kulak class, the mainstay of capitalist restoration; 
b) It transferred the most numerous labouring class in our country, 
the peasant class, from the path of individual farming, which breeds 
capitalism, to the path of co-operative, collective, Socialist farming; 
c) It furnished the Soviet regime with a Socialist base in agriculture
the most extensive and vitally necessary, yet least developed, 
branch of national economy. 
This destroyed the last mainsprings of the restoration of capitalism 
within the country and at the same time created new and decisive conditions 
for the building up of a Socialist economic system. 
Explaining the reasons for the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a 
class, and summing up the results of the mass movement of the peasants 
for solid collectivization, Comrade Stalin wrote in 1929: 
³The last hope of the capitalists of all countries, who are dreaming 
of restoring capitalism in the U.S.S.R.the sacred principle of 
private property¹is collapsing and vanishing. The peasants, whom 
they regarded as material manuring the soil for capitalism, are abandoning 
en masse the lauded banner of private property¹ and are 
taking to the path of collectivism, the path of Socialism. The last 
hope for the restoration of capitalism is crumbling.² (Stalin, Leninism, 
Vol. II, ³A Year of Great Change.²) 
The policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class was embodied in the 
historic resolution on ³The Rate of Collectivization and State Measures 
to Assist the Development of Collective Farms² adopted by the Central 
Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) on January 5, 1930. In this 
decision, full account was taken of the diversity of conditions in the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 306 
various districts of the U.S.S.R. and the varying degrees to which the 
regions were ripe for collectivization. 
Different rates of collectivization were established, for which purpose 
the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) divided the regions of the 
U.S.S.R. into three groups. 
The first group included the principal grain-growing areas: viz., the 
North Caucasus (the Kuban, Don and Terek), the Middle Volga and 
the Lower Volga, which were ripest for collectivization since they had 
the most tractors, the most state farms, and the most experience in 
fighting the kulaks, gained in past grain-purchasing campaigns. The 
Central Committee proposed that in this group of grain-growing areas 
collectivization should in the main be completed in the spring of 1931. 
The second group of grain-growing areas, the Ukraine, the Central 
Black-Earth Region, Siberia, the Urals, Kazakhstan and others could 
complete collectivization in the main in the spring of 1932. 
The other regions, territories and republics (Moscow Region, Transcaucasia, 
the republics of Central Asia, etc.) could extend the process 
of collectivization to the end of the Five-Year Plan, that is, to 1933. 
In view of the growing speed of collectivization, the Central Committee 
of the Party considered it necessary to accelerate the construction 
of plants for the production of tractors, harvester combines, tractordrawn 
machinery, etc. Simultaneously, the Central Committee demanded 
that ³the tendency to underestimate the importance of horse traction at 
the present stage of the collective-farm movement, a tendency which was 
leading to the reckless disposal and sale of horses, be resolutely checked.² 
State loans to collective farms for the year 1929-30 were doubled 
(500,000,000 rubles) as compared with the original plan. 
The expense of the surveying and demarcation of the lands of the 
collective farms was to be borne by the state. 
The resolution contained the highly important direction that the 
chief form of the collective-farm movement at the given stage must be 
the agricultural artel, in which only the principal means of production 
are collectivized. 
The Central Committee most seriously warned Party organizations 
³against any attempts whatsoever to force the collective-farm movement 
by decrees¹ from above, which might involve the danger of the substitution 
of mock-collectivization for real Socialist emulation in the organization 
of collective farms.² (Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.], Russ. 
ed., Part II, page 662.) 
In this resolution the Central Committee made it clear how the 
Party¹s new policy in the countryside should be applied.

307 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
The policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class and of solid collectivization 
stimulated a powerful collective-farm movement. The peasants 
of whole villages and districts joined the collective farms, sweeping the 
kulaks from their path and freeing themselves from kulak bondage. 
But with all the phenomenal progress of collectivization, certain 
faults on the part of Party workers, distortions of the Party policy in 
collective farm development, soon revealed themselves. Although the 
Central Committee had warned Party workers not to be carried away 
by the success of collectivization, many of them began to force the pace 
of collectivization artificially, without regard to the conditions of time 
and place, and heedless of the degree of readiness of the peasants to 
join the collective farms. 
It was found that the voluntary principle of forming collective farms 
was being violated, and that in a number of districts the peasants were 
being forced into the collective farms under threat of being dispossessed, 
disfranchised, and so on. 
In a number of districts, preparatory work and patient explanation 
of the underlying principles of the Party¹s policy with regard to collectivization 
were being replaced by bureaucratic decreeing from above, by 
exaggerated, fictitious figures regarding the formation of collective farms, 
by an artificial inflation of the percentage of collectivization. 
Although the Central Committee had specified that the chief form 
of the collective-farm movement must be the agricultural artel, in which 
only the principal means of production are collectivized, in a number 
of places pigheaded attempts were made to skip the artel form and pass 
straight to the commune; dwellings, milch-cows, small livestock, poultry, 
etc., not exploited for the market, were collectivized. 
Carried away by the initial success of collectivization, persons in 
authority in certain regions violated the Central Committee¹s explicit 
instructions regarding the pace and time limits of collectivization. In 
their zeal for inflated figures, the leadership of the Moscow Region gave 
the cue to their subordinates to complete collectivization by the spring 
of 1930, although they had no less than three years (till the end of 
1932) for this purpose. Even grosser were the violations in Transcaucasia 
and Central Asia. 
Taking advantage of these distortions of policy for their own provocative 
ends, the kulaks and their toadies would themselves propose that 
communes be formed instead of agricultural artels, and that dwellings, 
small livestock and poultry be collectivized forthwith. Furthermore, the 
kulaks instigated the peasants to slaughter their animals before entering 
the collective farms, arguing that ³they will be taken away anyhow.²

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 308 
The class enemy calculated that the distortions and mistakes committed 
by the local organizations in the process of collectivization would incense 
the peasantry and provoke revolts against the Soviet Government. 
As a result of the mistakes of Party organizations and the downright 
provocateur actions of the class enemy, in the latter half of February 
1930, against the general background of the unquestionable success of 
collectivization, there were dangerous signs of serious discontent among 
the peasantry in a number of districts. Here and there, the kulaks and 
their agents even succeeded in inciting the peasants to outright anti-Soviet 
actions. 
Having received a number of alarming signals of distortions of the 
Party line that might jeopardize collectivization, the Central Committee 
of the Party immediately proceeded to remedy the situation, to set the 
Party workers the task of rectifying the mistakes as quickly as possible. 
On March 2, 1930, by decision of the Central Committee, Comrade 
Stalin¹s article, ³Dizzy With Success,² was published. This article was 
a warning to all who had been so carried away by the success of collectivization 
as to commit gross mistakes and depart from the Party line, 
to all who were trying to coerce the peasants to join the collective farms. 
The article laid the utmost emphasis on the principle that the formation 
of collective farms must be voluntary, and on the necessity of making 
allowances for the diversity of conditions in the various districts of the 
U.S.S.R. when determining the pace and methods of collectivization. 
Comrade Stalin reiterated that the chief form of the collective-farm 
movement was the agricultural artel, in which only the principal means 
of production, chiefly those used in grain growing, are collectivized, 
while household land, dwellings, part of the dairy cattle, small livestock, 
poultry, etc., are not collectivized. 
Comrade Stalin¹s article was of the utmost political moment. It 
helped the Party organizations to rectify their mistakes and dealt a 
severe blow to the enemies of the Soviet Government who had been 
hoping to take advantage of the distortions of policy to set the peasants 
against the Soviet Government. The broad mass of the peasants now 
saw that the line of the Bolshevik Party had nothing in common with 
the pigheaded ³Left² distortions of local authorities. The article set the 
minds of the peasants at rest. 
In order to complete the work begun by Comrade Stalin¹s article 
in rectifying distortions and mistakes, the Central Committee of the 
C.P.S.U.(B.) decided to strike another blow at them, and on March 
15, 1930, published its resolution on ³Measures to Combat the Distortions 
of the Party Line in the Collective-Farm Movement.²

309 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
This resolution made a detailed analysis of the mistakes committed, 
showing that they were the result of a departure from the Leninist- 
Stalinist line of the Party, the result of a flagrant breach of Party instructions. 
The Central Committee pointed out that these ³Left² distortions 
were of direct service to the class enemy. 
The Central Committee gave directions that ³persons who are unable 
or unwilling earnestly to combat distortions of the Party line must 
be removed from their posts and replaced.² (Resolutions of the 
C.P.S.U.[B.], Part II, p. 663.) 
The Central Committee changed the leadership of certain regional 
and territorial Party organizations (Moscow Region, Transcaucasia) 
which had committed political mistakes and proved incapable of rectifying 
them. 
On April 3, 1930, Comrade Stalin¹s ³Reply to Collective Farm 
Comrades² was published, in which he indicated the root cause of the 
mistakes in the peasant question and the major mistakes committed in 
the collective-farm movement, viz., an incorrect approach to the middle 
peasant, violation of the Leninist principle that the formation of collective 
farms must be voluntary, violation of the Leninist principle that allowance 
must be made for the diversity of conditions in the various districts of 
the U.S.S.R., and the attempts to skip the artel form and to pass straight 
to the commune. 
The result of all these measures was that the Party secured the correction 
of the distortions of policy committed by local Party workers in 
a number of districts. 
It required the utmost firmness on the part of the Central Committee 
and its ability to go against the current in order to promptly 
correct that considerable body of Party workers who, carried away by 
success, had been rapidly straying from the Party line. 
The Party succeeded in correcting the distortions of the Party line 
in the collective-farm movement. 
This made it possible to consolidate the success of the collectivefarm 
movement. 
It also made possible a new and powerful advance of the collectivefarm 
movement. 
Prior to the Party¹s adoption of the policy of eliminating the kulaks 
as a class, an energetic offensive against the capitalist elements with the 
object of eliminating them had been waged chiefly in the towns, on the 
industrial front. So far, the countryside, agriculture, had been lagging 
behind the towns, behind industry. Consequently, the offensive had not

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 310 
borne an all-round, complete and general character. But now that the 
backwardness of the countryside was becoming a thing of the past, now 
that the peasants¹ fight for the elimination of the kulak class had taken 
clear shape, and the Party had adopted the policy of eliminating the 
kulak class, the offensive against the capitalist elements assumed a general 
character, the partial offensive developed into an offensive along the 
whole front. By the time the Sixteenth Party Congress was convened, 
the general offensive against the capitalist elements was proceeding all 
along the line. 
The Sixteenth Party Congress met on June 26, 1930. It was 
attended by 1,268 delegates with vote and 891 delegates with voice 
but no vote, representing 1,260,874 Party members and 711,609 candidate 
members. 
The Sixteenth Party Congress is known in the annals of the Party 
as ³the congress of the sweeping offensive of Socialism along the whole 
front, of the elimination of the kulaks as a class, and of the realization 
of solid collectivization.² (Stalin.) 
Presenting the political report of the Central Committee, Comrade 
Stalin showed what big victories had been won by the Bolshevik Party 
in developing the Socialist offensive. 
Socialist industrialization had progressed so far that the share of 
industry in the total production of the country now predominated over 
that of agriculture. In the fiscal year 1929-30, the share of industry 
already comprised no less than 53 per cent of the total production of 
the country, while the share of agriculture was about 47 per cent. 
In the fiscal year 1926-27, at the time of the Fifteenth Party Congress, 
the total output of industry had been only 102.5 per cent of the 
pre-war output; in the year 1929-30, at the time of the Sixteenth Congress, 
it was already about 180 per cent. 
Heavy industrythe production of means of production, machinebuilding
was steadily growing in power. 
³. . . We are on the eve of the transformation of our country 
from an agrarian to an industrial country,² declared Comrade Stalin 
at the congress, amidst hearty acclamation. 
Still, the high rate of industrial development, Comrade Stalin explained, 
was not to be confused with the level of industrial development. 
Despite the unprecedented rate of development of Socialist industry, we 
were still far behind the advanced capitalist countries as regards the level 
of industrial development. This was so in the case of electric power, in

311 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
spite of the phenomenal progress of electrification in the U.S.S.R. This 
was the case with metal. According to the plan, the output of pig-iron 
in the U.S.S.R. was to be 5,500,000 tons in the year 1929-30, when 
the output of pig-iron in Germany in 1929 was 13,400,000 tons, and 
in France 10,450,000 tons. In order to make good our technical and 
economic backwardness in the minimum of time, our rate of industrial 
development had to be further accelerated, and a most resolute fight 
waged against the opportunists who were striving to reduce the rate of 
development of Socialist industry. 
³. . . People who talk about the necessity of reducing the rate of 
development of our industry are enemies of Socialism, agents of 
our class enemies,² said Comrade Stalin. (Stalin, Leninism, Vol. II, 
³Political Report of the Central Committee to the Sixteenth Congress 
of the C.P.S.U.²) 
After the program of the first year of the First Five-Year Plan had 
been successfully fulfilled and surpassed, a slogan originated among the 
masses³Fulfil the Five-Year Plan in Four Years.² A number of 
branches of industry (oil, peat, general machine-building, agricultural 
machinery, electrical equipment) were carrying out their plans so successfully 
that their five-year-plans could be fulfilled in two and a half or 
three years. This proved that the slogan ³The Five-Year Plan in Four 
Years² was quite feasible, and thus exposed the opportunism of the 
sceptics who doubted it. 
The Sixteenth Congress instructed the Central Committee of the 
Party to ³ensure that the spirited Bolshevik tempo of Socialist construction 
be maintained, and that the Five-Year Plan be actually fulfilled in 
four years.² 
By the time of the Sixteenth Party Congress, a momentous change 
had taken place in the development of agriculture in the U.S.S.R. The 
broad masses of the peasantry had turned towards Socialism. On May 1, 
1930, collectivization in the principal grain-growing regions embraced 
40-50 per cent of the peasant households (as against 2-3 per cent in the 
spring of 1928). The crop area of the collective farms reached 
36,000,000 hectares. 
Thus the increased program (30,000,000 hectares), laid down in 
the resolution of the Central Committee of January 5, 1930, was more 
than fulfilled. The five-year program of collective farm development 
had been fulfilled more than one and a half times in the space of two years. 
In three years the amount of produce marketed by the collective 
farms had increased more than forty-fold. Already in 1930 more than

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 312 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
half the marketed grain in the country came from the collective farms, 
quite apart from the grain produced by the state farms. 
This meant that from now on the fortunes of agriculture would 
be decided not by the individual peasant farms, but by the collective 
and state farms. 
While, before the mass influx of the peasantry into the collective 
farms, the Soviet power had leaned mainly on Socialist industry, now 
it began to lean also on the rapidly expanding Socialist sector of agriculture, 
the collective and state farms. 
The collective farm peasantry, as the Sixteenth Party Congress 
stated in one of its resolutions, had become ³a real and firm mainstay 
of the Soviet power.² 
3. POLICY OF RECONSTRUCTING ALL BRANCH¹S OF THE NATIONAL 
ECONOMY. IMPORTANCE OF TECHNIQUE. FURTHER 
SPREAD OF THE COLLECTIVE-FARM MOVEMENT. POLITICAL 
DEPARTMENTS OF THE MACHINE AND TRACTOR STATIONS. 
RESULTS OF THE FULFILMENT OF THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN IN 
FOUR YEARS. VICTORY OF SOCIALISM ALONG THE WHOLE 
FRONT. SEVENTEENTH PARTY CONGRESS 
When heavy industry and especially the machine-building industry 
had been built up and placed securely on their feet, and it was moreover 
clear that they were developing at a fairly rapid pace, the next task 
that faced the Party was to reconstruct all branches of the national 
economy on modern, up-to-date lines. Modern technique, modern 
machinery had to be supplied to the fuel industry, the metallurgical industry, 
the light industries, the food industry, the timber industry, the 
armament industry, the transport system, and to agriculture. In view of 
the colossal increase in the demand for farm produce and manufactured 
goods, it was necessary to double and treble output in all branches of 
production. But this could not be done unless the factories and mills, 
the state farms and collective farms were adequately supplied with up-todate 
equipment, since the requisite increase of output could not be secured 
with the old equipment. 
Unless the major branches of the national economy were reconstructed, 
it would be impossible to satisfy the new and ever growing 
demands of the country and its economic system. 
Without reconstruction, it would be impossible to complete the offensive 
of Socialism along the whole front, for the capitalist elements in

313 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
town and country had to be fought and vanquished not only by a new 
organization of labour and property, but also by a new technique, by 
technical superiority. 
Without reconstruction, it would be impossible to overtake and outstrip 
the technically and economically advanced capitalist countries, for 
although the U.S.S.R. had surpassed the capitalist countries in rate of 
industrial development, it still lagged a long way behind them in level 
of industrial development, in quantity of industrial output. 
In order that we might catch up with them, every branch of production 
had to be equipped with new technique and reconstructed on the 
most up-to-date technical lines. 
The question of technique had thus become of decisive importance. 
The main impediment was not so much an insufficiency of modern 
machinery and machine-toolsfor our machine-building industry was 
in a position to produce modern equipmentas the wrong attitude of 
our business executives to technique, their tendency to underrate the importance 
of technique in the period of reconstruction and to disdain it. 
In their opinion, technical matters were the affair of the ³experts,² something 
of second-rate importance, to be left in charge of the ³bourgeois 
experts²; they considered that Communist business executives need not 
interfere in the technical side of production and should attend to something 
more important, namely, the ³general² management of industry. 
The bourgeois ³experts² were therefore given a free hand in matters 
of production, while the Communist business executives reserved 
to themselves the function of ³general² direction, the signing of papers. 
It need scarcely be said that with such an attitude, ³general² direction 
was bound to degenerate into a mere parody of direction, a sterile 
signing of papers, a futile fussing with papers. 
It is clear that if Communist business executives had persisted in this 
disdainful attitude of technical matters, we would never have been able 
to overtake the advanced capitalist countries, let alone outstrip them. 
This attitude, especially in the reconstruction period, would have doomed 
our country to backwardness, and would have lowered our rates of 
development. As a matter of fact, this attitude to technical matters was 
a screen, a mask for the secret wish of a certain section of the Communist 
business executives to retard, to reduce the rate of industrial development, 
so as to be able to ³take it easy² by shunting the responsibility for production 
on to the ³experts.² 
It was necessary to get Communist business executives to turn their 
attention to technical matters, to acquire a taste for technique; they

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 314 
needed to be shown that it was vital for Bolshevik business executives 
to master modern technique, otherwise we would run the risk of condemning 
our country to backwardness and stagnation. 
Unless this problem were solved further progress would be impossible. 
Of utmost importance in this connection was the speech Comrade 
Stalin made at the First Conference of Industrial Managers in February 
1931. 
³It is sometimes asked,² said Comrade Stalin, ³whether it is not 
possible to slow down the tempo a bit, to put a check on the movement. 
No, comrades, it is not possible! The tempo must not be 
reduced! . . . To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. 
And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be 
beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! 
³Incidentally, the history of old Russia is one unbroken record of 
the beatings she suffered for falling behind, for her backwardness. 
She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the 
Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was 
beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the 
British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese 
barons. All beat herfor her backwardness. . . . 
³We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. 
We must make good this distance in ten years. Either we do it, or 
they crush us. . . . 
³In ten years at most we must make good the distance we are 
lagging behind the advanced capitalist countries. We have all the 
objective¹ opportunities for this. The only thing lacking is the ability 
to make proper use of these opportunities. And that depends on us. 
Only on us! It is time we learned to use these opportunities. It is 
time to put an end to the rotten policy of non-interference in production. 
It is time to adopt a new policy, a policy adapted to the 
times the policy of interfering in everything. If you are a factory 
manager, then interfere in all the affairs of the factory, look into 
everything, let nothing escape you, learn and learn again. Bolsheviks 
must master technique. It is time Bolsheviks themselves became 
experts. In the period of reconstruction technique decides everything.² 
(Stalin, Leninism, Vol. II, ³The Tasks of Business Managers.² 
) 
The historic importance of Comrade Stalin¹s speech lay in the fact 
that it put an end to the disdainful attitude of Communist business

315 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
executives to technique, made them face the question of technique, opened 
a new phase in the struggle for the mastery of technique by the Bolsheviks 
themselves, and thereby helped to promote the work of economic 
reconstruction. 
From then on technical knowledge ceased to be a monopoly of the 
bourgeois ³experts,² and became a matter of vital concern to the Bolshevik 
business executives themselves, while the word ³expert² ceased 
to be a term of disparagement and became the honourable title of 
Bolsheviks who had mastered technique. 
From then on there were bound to appearand there actually did 
appearthousands upon thousands, whole battalions of Red experts, 
who had mastered technique and were able to direct industries. 
This was a new, Soviet technical intelligentsia, an intelligentsia of 
the working class and the peasantry, and they now constitute the main 
force in the management of our industries. 
All this was bound to promote, and actually did promote, the work 
of economic reconstruction. 
Reconstruction was not confined to industry and transport. It developed 
even more rapidly in agriculture. The reason is not far to seek: 
agriculture was less mechanized than other branches, and here the need 
for modern machinery was felt more acutely than elsewhere. And it 
was urgently essential to increase the supply of modern agricultural 
machines now that the number of collective farms was growing from 
month to month and week to week, and with it the demand for thousands 
upon thousands of tractors and other agricultural machines. 
The year 1931 witnessed a further advance in the collective-farm 
movement. In the principal grain-growing districts over 80 per cent 
of the peasant farms had already amalgamated to form collective farms. 
Here, solid collectivization had in the main already been achieved. In 
the less important grain-growing districts and in the districts growing 
industrial crops about 50 per cent of the peasant farms had joined the 
collective farms. By now there were 500,000 collective farms and 
4,000 state farms, which together cultivated two-thirds of the total crop 
area of the country, the individual peasants cultivating only one-third. 
This was a tremendous victory for Socialism in the countryside. 
But the progress of the collective-farm movement was so far to be 
measured in breadth rather than in depth: the collective farms were 
increasing in number and were spreading to district after district, but 
there was no commensurate improvement in the work of the collective 
farms or in the skill of their personnel. This was due to the fact that 
the growth of the leading cadres and trained personnel of the collective

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 316 
farms was not keeping pace with the numerical growth of the collective 
farms themselves. The consequence was that the work of the new collective 
farms was not always satisfactory, and the collective farms themselves 
were still weak. They were also held back by the shortage in the 
countryside of literate people indispensable to the collective farms (bookkeepers, 
stores managers, secretaries, etc.), and by the inexperience of 
the peasants in the management of large-scale collective enterprises. The 
collective farmers were the individual peasants of yesterday; they had 
experience in farming small plots of land, but none in managing big, 
collective farms. This experience could not be acquired in a day. 
The first stages of collective farm work were consequently marred 
by serious defects. It was found that work was still badly organized in 
the collective farms; labour discipline was slack. In many collective 
farms the income was distributed not by the number of work-day-units, 
but by the number of mouths to feed in the family. It often happened 
that slackers got a bigger return than conscientious hard-working collective 
farmers. These defects in the management of collective farms 
lowered the incentive of their members. There were many cases of 
members absenting themselves from work even at the height of the 
season, leaving part of the crops unharvested until the winter snows, 
while the reaping was done so carelessly that large quantities of grain 
were lost. The absence of individual responsibility for machines and 
horses, and for work generally, weakened the collective farms and reduced 
their revenues. 
The situation was particularly bad wherever former kulaks and 
their toadies had managed to worm their way into collective farms and 
to secure positions of trust in them. Not infrequently former kulaks 
would betake themselves to districts where they were unknown, and 
there make their way into the collective farms with the deliberate intention 
of sabotaging and doing mischief. Sometimes, owing to lack 
of vigilance on the part of Party workers and Soviet officials, kulaks 
managed to get into collective farms even in their own districts. What 
made it easier for former kulaks to penetrate into the collective farms 
was that they had radically changed their tactics. Formerly the kulaks 
had fought the collective farms openly, had savagely persecuted collective 
farm leading cadres and foremost collective farmers, nefariously murdering 
them, burning down their houses and barns. By these methods they 
had thought to intimidate the peasantry and to deter them from joining 
the collective farms. Now that their open struggle against the collective 
farms had failed, they changed their tactics. They laid aside their sawnoff 
shotguns and posed as innocent, unoffending folk who would not hurt

317 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
a fly. They pretended to be loyal Soviet supporters. Once inside the 
collective farms they stealthily carried on their sabotage. They strove to 
disorganize the collective farms from within, to undermine labour discipline 
and to muddle the harvest accounts and the records of work 
performed. It was part of their sinister scheme to destroy the horses of 
the collective farms by deliberately infecting them with glanders, mange 
and other diseases, or disabling them by neglect or other methods, in 
which they were often successful. They did damage to tractors and 
farm machinery. 
The kulaks were often able to deceive the collective farmers and 
commit sabotage with impunity because the collective farms were still 
weak and their personnel still inexperienced. 
To put an end to the sabotage of the kulaks and to expedite the 
work of strengthening the collective farms, the latter had to be given 
urgent and effective assistance in men, advice and leadership. 
This assistance was forthcoming from the Bolshevik Party. In January 
1933, the Central Committee of the Party adopted a decision to 
organize political departments in the machine and tractor stations serving 
the collective farms. Some 17,000 Party members were sent into the 
countryside to work in these political departments and to aid the collective 
farms. 
This assistance was highly effective. 
In two years (1933 and 1934) the political departments of the 
machine and tractor stations did a great deal to build up an active body 
of collective farmers, to eliminate the defects in the work of the collective 
farms, to consolidate them, and to rid them of kulak enemies and wreckers. 
The political departments performed their task with credit: they 
strengthened the collective farms both in regard to organization and 
efficiency, trained skilled personnel for them, improved their management 
and raised the political level of the collective farm members. 
Of great importance in stimulating the collective farmers to strive 
for the strengthening of the collective farms was the First All-Union 
Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers (February 1933) and 
the speech made by Comrade Stalin at this congress. 
Contrasting the old, pre-collective farm system in the countryside 
with the new, collective farm system, Comrade Stalin said: 
³Under the old system the peasants each worked in isolation, 
following the ancient methods of their forefathers and using antiquated 
implements of labour; they worked for the landlords and 
capitalists, the kulaks and profiteers; they lived in penury while they

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 318 
enriched others. Under the new, collective farm system, the peasants 
work in common, co-operatively, with the help of modern implements
tractors and agricultural machinery; they work for themselves 
and their collective farms; they live without capitalists and 
landlords, without kulaks and profiteers; they work with the object 
of raising their standard of welfare and culture from day to day.² 
(Stalin, Problems of Leninism, Russ. ed., p. 528.) 
Comrade Stalin showed in this speech what the peasants had achieved 
by adopting the collective farm way. The Bolshevik Party had helped 
millions of poor peasants to join the collective farms and to escape from 
servitude to the kulaks. By joining the collective farms, and having 
the best lands and the finest instruments of production at their disposal, 
millions of poor peasants who had formerly lived in penury had now 
as collective farmers risen to the level of middle peasants, and had attained 
material security. 
This was the first step in the development of collective farms, the 
first achievement. 
The next step, Comrade Stalin said, was to raise the collective farmers
both former poor peasants and former middle peasantsto an even 
higher level, to make all the collective farmers prosperous and all the 
collective farms Bolshevik. 
³Only one thing is now needed for the collective farmers to 
become prosperous,² Comrade Stalin said, ³and that is for them to 
work in the collective farms conscientiously, to make efficient use of 
the tractors and machines, to make efficient use of the draught 
cattle, to cultivate the land efficiently, and to cherish collective farm 
property.² (Ibid., pp. 532-3.) 
Comrade Stalin¹s speech made a profound impression on the millions 
of collective farmers and became a practical program of action for the 
collective farms. 
By the end of 1934 the collective farms had become a strong and 
invincible force. They already embraced about three-quarters of all the 
peasant households in the Soviet Union and about 90 per cent of the 
total crop area. 
In 1934 there were already 281,000 tractors and 32,000 harvester 
combines at work in the Soviet countryside. The spring sowing in that 
year was completed fifteen to twenty days earlier than in 1933, and 
thirty to forty days earlier than in 1932, while the plan of grain deliveries 
to the state was fulfilled three months earlier than in 1932. 
This showed how firmly established the collective farms had become

319 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
in two years, thanks to the tremendous assistance given them by the 
Party and the workers¹ and peasants¹ state. 
This solid victory of the collective farm system and the attendant 
improvement of agriculture enabled the Soviet Government to abolish 
the rationing of bread and all other products and to introduce the unrestricted 
sale of foodstuffs. 
Since the political departments of the machine and tractor stations 
had served the purpose for which they had been temporarily created, the 
Central Committee decided to convert them into ordinary Party bodies 
by merging them with the district Party Committees in their localities. 
All these achievements, both in agriculture and in industry, were 
made possible by the successful fulfilment of the Five-Year Plan. 
By the beginning of 1933 it was evident that the First Five-Year 
Plan had already been fulfilled ahead of time, fulfilled in four years 
and three months. 
This was a tremendous, epoch-making victory of the working class 
and peasantry of the U.S.S.R. 
Reporting to a plenary meeting of the Central Committee and the 
Central Control Commission of the Party, held in January 1933, Comrade 
Stalin reviewed the results of the First Five-Year Plan. The report 
made it clear that in the period which it took to fulfil the First Five-Year 
Plan, the Party and the Soviet Government had achieved the following 
major results. 
a) The U.S.S.R. had been converted from an agrarian country into 
an industrial country, for the proportion of industrial output to the total 
production of the country had risen to 70 per cent. 
b) The Socialist economic system had eliminated the capitalist elements 
in the sphere of industry and had become the sole economic system 
in industry. 
c) The Socialist economic system had eliminated the kulaks as a class 
in the sphere of agriculture, and had become the predominant force in 
agriculture. 
d) The collective farm system had put an end to poverty and want 
in the countryside, and tens of millions of poor peasants had risen to a 
level of material security. 
e) The Socialist system in industry had abolished unemployment, 
and while retaining the 8-hour day in a number of branches, had introduced 
the 7-hour day in the vast majority of enterprises and the 6-hour 
day in unhealthy occupations. 
f) The victory of Socialism in all branches of the national economy 
had abolished the exploitation of man by man.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 320
The sum and substance of the achievements of the First Five-Year 
Plan was that they had completely emancipated the workers and peasants 
from exploitation and had opened the way to a prosperous and 
cultured life for ALL working people in the U.S.S.R. 
In January 1934 the Party held its Seventeenth Congress. It was 
attended by 1,225 delegates with vote and 736 delegates with voice but 
no vote, representing 1,874,488 Party members and 935,298 candidate 
members. 
The congress reviewed the work of the Party since the last congress. 
It noted the decisive results achieved by Socialism in all branches of 
economic and cultural life and placed on record that the general line 
of the Party had triumphed along the whole front. 
The Seventeenth Party Congress is known in history as the ³Congress 
of Victors.² 
Reporting on the work of the Central Committee, Comrade Stalin 
pointed to the fundamental changes that had taken place in the U.S.S.R. 
during the period under review. 
³During this period, the U.S.S.R. has become radically transformed 
and has cast off the integument of backwardness and mediævalism. 
From an agrarian country it has become an industrial country. 
From a country of small individual agriculture it has become a 
country of collective, large-scale mechanized agriculture. From an 
ignorant, illiterate and uncultured country it has becomeor rather 
it is becominga literate and cultured country covered by a vast 
network of higher, intermediate and elementary schools teaching 
in the languages of the nationalities of the U.S.S.R. (Stalin, Seventeenth 
Congress of the C.P.S.U., ³Report on the Work of the 
Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.[B.],² p. 30.) 
By this time 99 per cent of the industry of the country was Socialist 
industry. Socialist agriculturethe collective farms and state farms 
embraced about 90 per cent of the total crop area of the country. As 
to trade, the capitalist elements had been completely ousted from this 
domain. 
When the New Economic Policy was being introduced, Lenin said 
that there were the elements of five social-economic formations in our 
country. The first was patriarchal economy, which was largely a natural 
form of economy, i.e., which practically carried on no trade. The second 
formation was small commodity production, as represented by the majority 
of the peasant farms, those which sold agricultural produce, and by 
the artisans. In the first years of NEP this economic formation embraced

321 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
the majority of the population. The third formation was private capitalism, 
which had begun to revive in the early period of NEP. The fourth 
formation was state capitalism, chiefly in the form of concessions, which 
had not developed to any considerable extent. The fifth formation was 
Socialism: Socialist industry, which was still weak, state farms and collective 
farms, which were economically insignificant at the beginning 
of NEP, state trade and co-operative societies, which were also weak 
at that time. 
Of all these formations, Lenin said, the Socialist formation must 
gain the upper hand. 
The New Economic Policy was designed to bring about the complete 
victory of Socialist forms of economy. 
And by the time of the Seventeenth Party Congress this aim had 
already been achieved. 
³We can now say,² said Comrade Stalin, ³that the first, the 
third and the fourth social-economic formations no longer exist; the 
second social-economic formation has been forced into a secondary 
position, while the fifth social-economic formationthe Socialist formation
now holds unchallenged sway and is the sole commanding 
force in the whole national economy.² (Ibid., p. 33.) 
An important place in Comrade Stalin¹s report was given to the 
question of ideological-political leadership. He warned the Party that 
although its enemies, the opportunists and nationalist deviators of all 
shades and complexions, had been defeated, remnants of their ideology 
still lingered in the minds of some Party members and often asserted 
themselves. The survivals of capitalism in economic life and particularly 
in the minds of men provided a favourable soil for the revival of the 
ideology of the defeated anti-Leninist groups. The development of people¹s 
mentality does not keep pace with their economic position. As a 
consequence, survivals of bourgeois ideas still remained in men¹s minds 
and would continue to do so even though capitalism had been abolished 
in economic life. It should also be borne in mind that the surrounding 
capitalist world, against which we had to keep our powder dry, was 
working to revive and foster these survivals. 
Comrade Stalin also dwelt on the survivals of capitalism in men¹s 
minds on the national question, where they were particularly tenacious. 
The Bolshevik Party was fighting on two fronts, both against the deviation 
to Great-Russian chauvinism and against the deviation to local 
nationalism. In a number of republics (the Ukraine, Byelorussia, and 
others) the Party organizations had relaxed the struggle against local

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 322 
nationalism, and had allowed it to grow to such an extent that it had allied 
itself with hostile forces, the forces of intervention, and had become a 
danger to the state. In reply to the question, which deviation in the 
national question was the major danger, Comrade Stalin said: 
³The major danger is the deviation against which we have 
ceased to fight, thereby allowing it to grow into a danger to the 
state.² (Ibid., p. 81.) 
Comrade Stalin called upon the Party to be more active in ideologicalpolitical 
work, systematically to expose the ideology and the remnants 
of the ideology of the hostile classes and of the trends hostile to Leninism. 
He further pointed out in his report that the adoption of correct 
decisions does not in itself guarantee the success of a measure. In order 
to guarantee success, it was necessary to put the right people in the 
right place, people able to give effect to the decisions of the leading 
organs and to keep a check on the fulfilment of decisions. Without these 
organizational measures there was a risk of decisions remaining scraps 
of paper, divorced from practical life. Comrade Stalin referred in support 
of this to Lenin¹s famous maximum that the chief thing in organizational 
work was the choice of personnel and the keeping of a check on 
the fulfilment of decisions. Comrade Stalin said that the disparity between 
adopted decisions and the organizational work of putting these 
decisions into effect and of keeping a check on their fulfilment was the 
chief evil in our practical work. 
In order to keep a better check on the fulfilment of Party and Government 
decisions, the Seventeenth Party Congress set up a Party Control 
Commission under the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) 
and a Soviet Control Commission under the Council of People¹s Commissars 
of the U.S.S.R. in place of the combined Central Control Commission 
and Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection, this body having 
completed the tasks for which it had been set up by the Twelfth Party 
Congress. 
Comrade Stalin formulated the organizational tasks of the Party in 
the new stage as follows: 
1) Our organizational work must be adapted to the requirements 
of the political line of the Party; 
2) Organizational leadership must be raised to the level of political 
leadership. 
3) Organizational leadership must be made fully equal to the task of 
ensuring the realization of the political slogans and decisions of the Party. 
In conclusion, Comrade Stalin warned the Party that although

323 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
Socialism had achieved great successes, successes of which we could be 
justly proud, we must not allow ourselves to be carried away, to get 
³swelled head,² to be lulled by success. 
³. . . We must not lull the Party, but sharpen its vigilance; we 
must not lull it to sleep, but keep it ready for action; not disarm it, 
but arm it; not demobilize it, but hold it in a state of mobilization 
for the fulfilment of the Second Five-Year Plan,² said Comrade 
Stalin. (Ibid., p. 96.) 
The Seventeenth Congress heard reports from Comrades Molotov 
and Kuibyshev on the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of 
the national economy. The program of the Second Five-Year Plan 
was even vaster than that of the First Five-Year Plan. By the end of 
the Second Five-Year Plan period, in 1937, industrial output was to be 
increased approximately eightfold in comparison with pre-war. Capital 
development investments in all branches in the period of the Second 
Five-Year Plan were to amount to 133,000,000,000 rubles, as against 
a little over 64,000,000,000 rubles in the period of the First Five-Year 
Plan. 
This immense scope of new capital construction work would ensure 
the complete technical re-equipment of all branches of the national 
economy. 
The Second Five-Year Plan was to complete in the main the mechanization 
of agriculture. Aggregate tractor power was to increase from 
2,250,000 hp. in 1932 to over 8,000,000 hp. in 1937. The plan 
provided for the extensive employment of scientific agricultural methods 
(correct crop rotation, use of selected seed, autumn ploughing, etc.). 
A tremendous plan for the technical reconstruction of the means of 
transport and communication was outlined. 
The Second Five-Year Plan contained an extensive program for 
the further improvement of the material and cultural standards of the 
workers and peasants. 
The Seventeenth Congress paid great attention to matters of organization 
and adopted decisions on the work of the Party and the Soviets 
in connection with a report made by Comrade Kaganovich. The question 
of organization had acquired even greater importance now that 
the general line of the Party had won and the Party policy had been 
tried and tested by the experience of millions of workers and peasants. 
The new and complex tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan called for 
a higher standard of work in all spheres.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 324 
³The major tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, viz., to completely 
eliminate the capitalist elements, to overcome the survivals of 
capitalism in economic life and in the minds of men, to complete the 
reconstruction of the whole national economy on modern technical 
lines, to learn to use the new technical equipment and the new enterprises, 
to mechanize agriculture and increase its productivityinsistently 
and urgently confront us with the problem of improving 
work in all spheres, first and foremost in practical organizational 
leadership,² it was stated in the decisions of the congress on organizational 
questions. (Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.], Russ. ed., 
Part II, p. 591.) 
The Seventeenth Congress adopted new Party Rules, which differ 
from the old ones firstly by the addition of a preamble. This preamble 
gives a brief definition of the Communist Party, and a definition of its 
role in the struggle of the proletariat and its place in the organism of 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. The new rules enumerate in detail 
the duties of Party members. Stricter regulations governing the admission 
of new members and a clause concerning sympathizers¹ groups were 
introduced. The new rules give a more detailed exposition of the organizational 
structure of the Party, and formulate anew the clauses dealing 
with the Party nuclei, or primary organizations, as they have been called 
since the Seventeenth Party Congress. The clauses dealing with inner- 
Party democracy and Party discipline were also formulated anew. 
4. DEGENERATION OF THE BUKHARINITES INTO POLITICAL 
DOUBLE-DEALERS. DEGENERATION OF THE TROTSKYITE 
DOUBLE-DEALERS INTO A WHITEGUARD GANG OF ASSASSINS 
AND SPIES. FOUL MURDER OF S. M. KIROV. MEASURES OF THE 
PARTY TO HEIGHTEN BOLSHEVIK VIGILANCE 
The achievements of Socialism in our country were a cause of rejoicing 
not only to the Party, and not only to the workers and collective 
farmers, but also to our Soviet intelligentsia, and to all honest citizens 
of the Soviet Union. 
But they were no cause of rejoicing to the remnants of the defeated 
exploiting classes; on the contrary, they only enraged them the more 
as time went on. 
They infuriated the lickspittles of the defeated classesthe puny 
remnants of the following of Bukharin and Trotsky. 
These gentry were guided in their evaluation of the achievements

325 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
of the workers and collective farmers not by the interests of the people, 
who applauded every such achievement, but by the interests of their 
own wretched and putrid faction, which had lost all contact with the 
realities of life. Since the achievements of Socialism in our country meant 
the victory of the policy of the Party and the utter bankruptcy of their 
own policy, these gentry, instead of admitting the obvious facts and 
joining the common cause, began to revenge themselves on the Party 
and the people for their own failure, for their own bankruptcy; they 
began to resort to foul play and sabotage against the cause of the workers 
and collective farmers, to blow up pits, set fire to factories, and 
commit acts of wrecking in collective and state farms, with the object 
of undoing the achievements of the workers and collective farmers and 
evoking popular discontent against the Soviet Government. And in 
order, while doing so, to shield their puny group from exposure and 
destruction, they simulated loyalty to the Party, fawned upon it, eulogized 
it, cringed before it more and more, while in reality continuing 
their underhand, subversive activities against the workers and peasants. 
At the Seventeenth Party Congress, Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky 
made repentant speeches, praising the Party and extolling its achievements 
to the skies. But the congress detected a ring of insincerity and 
duplicity in their speeches; for what the Party expects from its members 
is not eulogies and rhapsodies over its achievements, but conscientious 
work on the Socialist front. And this was what the Bukharinites had 
showed no signs of for a long time. The Party saw that the hollow 
speeches of these gentry were in reality meant for their supporters outside 
the congress, to serve as a lesson to them in duplicity, and a call 
to them not to lay down their arms. 
Speeches were also made at the Seventeenth Congress by the Trotskyites 
Zinoviev and Kamenev, who lashed themselves extravagantly 
for their mistakes, and eulogized the Party no less extravagantly for its 
achievements. But the congress could not help seeing that both their 
nauseating self-castigation and their fulsome praise of the Party were 
only meant to hide an uneasy and unclean conscience. However, the 
Party did not yet know or suspect that while these gentry were making 
their cloying speeches at the congress they were hatching a villainous 
plot against the life of S. M. Kirov. 
On December 1, 1934, S. M. Kirov was foully murdered in the 
Smolny, in Leningrad, by a shot from a revolver. 
The assassin was caught red-handed and turned out to be a member 
of a secret counter-revolutionary group made up of members of an anti- 
Soviet group of Zinovievites in Leningrad.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 326 
S. M. Kirov was loved by the Party and the working class, and his 
murder stirred the people profoundly, sending a wave of wrath and 
deep sorrow through the country. 
The investigation established that in 1933 and 1934 an underground 
counter-revolutionary terrorist group had been formed in Leningrad 
consisting of former members of the Zinoviev opposition and headed by 
a so-called ³Leningrad Centre.² The purpose of this group was to 
murder leaders of the Communist Party. S. M. Kirov was chosen as the 
first victim. The testimony of the members of this counter-revolutionary 
group showed that they were connected with representatives of foreign 
capitalist states and were receiving funds from them. 
The exposed members of this organization were sentenced by the 
Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. to the supreme 
penaltyto be shot. 
Soon afterwards the existence of an underground counter-revolutionary 
organization called the ³Moscow Centre² was discovered. The 
preliminary investigation and the trial revealed the villainous part played 
by Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yevdokimov and other leaders of this organization 
in cultivating the terrorist mentality among their followers, and in 
plotting the murder of members of the Party Central Committee and 
of the Soviet Government. 
To such depths of duplicity and villainy had these people sunk that 
Zinoviev, who was one of the organizers and instigators of the assassination 
of S. M. Kirov, and who had urged the murderer to hasten the 
crime, wrote an obituary of Kirov speaking of him in terms of eulogy, 
and demanded that it be published. 
The Zinovievites simulated remorse in court; but they persisted in 
their duplicity even in the dock. They concealed their connection with 
Trotsky. They concealed the fact that together with the Trotskyites 
they had sold themselves to fascist espionage services. They concealed 
their spying and wrecking activities. They concealed from the court 
their connections with the Bukharinites, and the existence of a united 
Trotsky-Bukharin gang of fascist hirelings. 
As it later transpired, the murder of Comrade Kirov was the work 
of this united Trotsky-Bukharin gang. 
Even then, in 1935, it had become clear that the Zinoviev group 
was a camouflaged Whiteguard organization whose members fully deserved 
to be treated as Whiteguards. 
A year later it became known that the actual, real and direct organizers 
of the murder of Kirov were Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 
their accomplices, and that they had also made preparations for the

327 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
assassination of other members of the Central Committee. Zinoviev, 
Kamenev, Bakayev, Yevdokimov, Pikel, I. N. Smirnov, Mrachkovsky, 
Ter-Vaganyan, Reingold and others were committed for trial. Confronted 
by direct evidence, they had to admit publicly, in open court, 
that they had not only organized the assassination of Kirov, but had 
been planning to murder all the other leaders of the Party and the Government. 
Later investigation established the fact that these villains had 
been engaged in espionage and in organizing acts of diversion. The 
full extent of the monstrous moral and political depravity of these men, 
their despicable villainy and treachery, concealed by hypocritical professions 
of loyalty to the Party, were revealed at a trial in Moscow, 1936. 
The chief instigator and ringleader of this gang of assassins and 
spies was Judas Trotsky. Trotsky¹s assistants and agents in carrying 
out his counter-revolutionary instructions were Zinoviev, Kamenev and 
their Trotskyite underlings. They were preparing to bring about the 
defeat of the U.S.S.R. in the event of attack by imperialist countries; 
they had become defeatists with regard to the workers¹ and peasants¹ 
state; they had become despicable tools and agents of the German and 
Japanese fascists. 
The main lesson which the Party organizations had to draw from 
the trials of the persons implicated in the foul murder of S. M. Kirov 
was that they must put an end to their own political blindness and 
political heedlessness, and must increase their vigilance and the vigilance 
of all Party members. 
In a circular letter to Party organizations on the subject of the foul 
murder of S. M. Kirov, the Central Committee of the Party stated: 
³a) We must put an end to the opportunist complacency engendered 
by the enormous assumption that as we grow stronger the 
enemy will become tamer and more inoffensive. This assumption 
is an utter fallacy. It is a recrudescence of the Right deviation, 
which assured all and sundry that our enemies would little by little 
creep into Socialism and in the end become real Socialists. The 
Bolsheviks have no business to rest on their laurels; they have no 
business to sleep at their posts. What we need is not complacency, 
but vigilance, real Bolshevik revolutionary vigilance. It should be 
remembered that the more hopeless the position of the enemies, the 
more eagerly will they dutch at extreme measures¹ as the only recourse 
of the doomed in their struggle against the Soviet power. We 
must remember this, and be vigilant. 
³b) We must properly organize the teaching of the history of

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 328
the Party to Party members, the study of all and sundry anti-Party 
groups in the history of our Party, their methods of combating the 
Party line, their tactics andstill more the tactics and methods 
of our Party in combating anti-Party groups, the tactics and methods 
which have enabled our Party to vanquish and demolish these groups. 
Party members should not only know how the Party combated and 
vanquished the Constitutional-Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
Mensheviks and Anarchists, but also how it combated and vanquished 
the Trotskyites, the Democratic-Centralists,¹ the Workers¹ Opposition,¹ 
the Zinovievites, the Right deviators, the Right-Leftist freaks 
and the like. It should never be forgotten that a knowledge and 
understanding of the history of our Party is a most important and 
essential means of fully ensuring the revolutionary vigilance of the 
Party members.² 
Of enormous importance in this period was the purge of the Party 
ranks from adventitious and alien elements, begun in 1933, and especially 
the careful verification of the records of Party members and the 
exchange of old Party cards for new ones undertaken after the foul 
murder of S. M. Kirov. 
Prior to the verification of the records of Party members, irresponsibility 
and negligence in the handling of Party cards had prevailed in 
many Party organizations. In a number of the organizations utterly 
intolerable chaos in the registration of Communists was revealed, a state 
of affairs which enemies had been turning to their nefarious ends, using 
the possession of a Party card as a screen for espionage, wrecking, etc. 
Many leaders of Party organizations had entrusted the enrolment of 
new members and the issuance of Party cards to persons in minor 
positions, and often even to Party members of untested reliability. 
In a circular letter to all organizations dated May 13, 1935, on 
the subject of the registration, safekeeping and issuance of Party cards, the 
Central Committee instructed all organizations to make a careful verification 
of the records of Party members and ³to establish Bolshevik 
order in our own Party home.² 
The verification of the records of Party members was of great political 
value. In connection with the report of Comrade Yezhov, Secretary 
of the Central Committee, on the results of the verification of the 
records of Party members, a plenary meeting of the Central Committee 
of the Party adopted a resolution on December 25, 1935, declaring 
that this verification was an organizational and political measure of 
enormous importance in strengthening the ranks of the C.P.S.U.(B.)

329 1 9 3 0 - 1 9 3 4 
After the verification of the records of Party members and the exchange 
of Party cards, the admission of new members into the Party was 
resumed. In this connection the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) 
demanded that new members should not be admitted into the Party 
wholesale, but on the basis of a strictly individual enrolment of ³people 
really advanced and really devoted to the cause of the working class, 
the finest people of our country, drawn above all from among the workers, 
and also from among peasants and active intelligentsia, who had been 
tried and tested in various sectors of the struggle for Socialism.² 
In resuming the admission of new members to the Party, the Central 
Committee instructed Party organizations to bear in mind that hostile 
elements would persist in their attempts to worm their way into the 
ranks of the C.P.S.U.(B.). Consequently: 
³It is the task of every Party organization to increase Bolshevik 
vigilance to the utmost, to hold aloft the banner of the Leninist 
Party, and to safeguard the ranks of the Party from the penetration 
of alien, hostile and adventitious elements.² (Resolution of the 
Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.[B.], September 29, 1936, published 
in Pravda No. 270, 1936.) 
Purging and consolidating its ranks, destroying the enemies of the 
Party and relentlessly combating distortions of the Party line, the Bolshevik 
Party rallied closer than ever around its Central Committee 
under whose leadership the Party and the Soviet land now passed to 
a new stagethe completion of the construction of a classless, Socialist 
society. 
B R I E F S U M M A R Y 
In the period 1930-34 the Bolshevik Party solved what was, after 
the winning of power, the most difficult historical problem of the proletarian 
revolution, namely, to get the millions of small peasant owners to 
adopt the path of collective farming, the path of Socialism. 
The elimination of the kulaks, the most numerous of the exploiting 
classes, and the adoption of collective farming by the bulk of the 
peasants led to the destruction of the last roots of capitalism in the 
country, to the final victory of Socialism in agriculture, and to the complete 
consolidation of the Soviet power in the countryside. 
After overcoming a number of difficulties of an organizational character, 
the collective farms became firmly established and entered upon 
the path of prosperity.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 330
The effect of the First Five-Year Plan was to lay an unshakable 
foundation of a Socialist economic system in our country in the shape 
of a first-class Socialist heavy industry and collective mechanized agriculture, 
to put an end to unemployment, to abolish the exploitation of 
man by man, and to create the conditions for the steady improvement 
of the material and cultural standards of our working people. 
These colossal achievements were attained by the working class, 
the collective farmers, and the working people of our country generally, 
thanks to the bold, revolutionary and wise policy of the Party and the 
Government. 
The surrounding capitalist world, striving to undermine and disrupt 
the might of the U.S.S.R., worked with redoubled energy to organize 
gangs of assassins, wreckers and spies within the U.S.S.R. This hostile 
activity of the capitalist encirclement became particularly marked with the 
advent of fascism to power in Germany and Japan. In the Trotskyites 
and Zinovievites, fascism found faithful servants who were ready to 
spy, sabotage, commit acts of terrorism and diversion, and to work for 
the defeat of the U.S.S.R. in order to restore capitalism. 
The Soviet Government punished these degenerates with an iron 
hand, dealing ruthlessly with these enemies of the people and traitors 
to the country.

THE BOLSHEVIK PARTY IN THE STRUGGLE 
TO COMPLETE THE BUILDING 
OF THE SOCIALIST SOCIETY. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW 
CONSTITUTION 
( 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 ) 
1. INTERNATIONAL SITUATION IN 1935-37. TEMPORARY MITIGATION 
OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. BEGINNING OF A NEW ECONOMIC 
CRISIS. SEIZURE OF ETHIOPIA BY ITALY. GERMAN AND 
ITALIAN INTERVENTION IN SPAIN. JAPANESE INVASION OF 
CENTRAL CHINA. BEGINNING OF SECOND IMPERIALIST WAR. 
The economic crisis that had broken out in the capitalist countries 
in the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1933. After that 
industry ceased to decline, the crisis was succeeded by a period of stagnation, 
and was then followed by a certain revival, a certain upward 
trend. But this upward trend was not of the kind that ushers in an 
industrial boom on a new and higher basis. World capitalist industry 
was unable even to reach the level of 1929, attaining by the middle 
of 1937 only 95-96 per cent of that level. And already in the second 
half of 1937 a new economic crisis began, affecting first of all the United 
States. By the end of 1937 the number of unemployed in the U.S.A. 
had again risen to ten million. In Great Britain, too, unemployment 
was rapidly increasing. 
The capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a new 
economic crisis before they had even recovered from the ravages of the 
preceding one. 
The result was that the contradictions between the imperialist countries, 
as likewise between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, grew still 
more acute. As a consequence, the aggressor states redoubled their 
efforts to recoup themselves for the losses caused by the economic crisis 
at home at the expense of other, poorly defended, countries. The two 
notorious aggressor states, Germany and Japan, were this time joined 
by a thirdItaly. 
In 1935, fascist Italy attacked Ethiopia and subjugated her. She 
did so without any reason or justification in ³international law²; she 
331

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 332 
attacked her like a robber, without declaring war, as is now the vogue 
with the fascists. This was a blow not only at Ethiopia, but also at 
Great Britain, at her sea routes from Europe to India and to Asia 
generally. Great Britain vainly attempted to prevent Italy from establishing 
herself in Ethiopia. Italy later withdrew from the League of Nations 
so as to leave her hands free, and began to arm on an intensive scale. 
Thus, on the shortest sea routes between Europe and Asia, a new 
war knot was tied. 
Fascist Germany tore up the Versailles Peace Treaty by a unilateral 
act, and adopted a scheme for the forcible revision of the map of Europe. 
The German fascists made no secret of the fact that they were seeking 
to subjugate the neighbouring states, or, at least, to seize such of their 
territories as were peopled by Germans. Accordingly, they planned first 
to seize Austria, then to strike at Czechoslovakia, then, maybe, at Poland
which also has a compact territory peopled by Germans and 
bordering on Germanyand then . . . well, then ³we shall see.² 
In the summer of 1936, Germany and Italy started military intervention 
against the Spanish Republic. Under the guise of supporting 
the Spanish fascists, they secured the opportunity of surreptitiously landing 
troops on Spanish territory, in the rear of France, and stationing 
their fleets in Spanish watersin the zones of the Balearic Islands and 
Gibraltar in the south, the Atlantic Ocean in the west, and the Bay of 
Biscay in the north. At the beginning of 1938 the German fascists 
seized Austria, thus establishing themselves in the middle reaches of the 
Danube and expanding in the south of Europe, towards the Adriatic 
Sea.
The German and Italian fascists extended their intervention in Spain, 
at the same time assuring the world that they were fighting the Spanish 
³Reds² and harboured no other designs. But this was a crude and 
shallow camouflage designed to deceive simpletons. As a matter of fact, 
they were striking at Great Britain and France, by bestriding the sea 
communications of these countries with their vast African and Asiatic 
colonial possessions. 
As to the seizure of Austria, this at any rate could not be passed 
off as a struggle against the Versailles Treaty, as part of Germany¹s 
effort to protect her ³national² interests by recovering territory lost in 
the first Imperialist War. Austria had not formed part of Germany, 
either before or after the war. The forcible annexation of Austria was 
a glaring imperialist seizure of foreign territory. It left no doubt as to 
fascist Germany¹s designs to gain a dominant position on the West 
European continent.

333 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
This was above all a blow at the interests of France and Great 
Britain. 
Thus, in the south of Europe, in the zone of Austria and the Adriatic, 
and in the extreme west of Europe, in the zone of Spain and the waters 
washing her shores, new war knots were tied. 
In 1937, the Japanese fascist militarists seized Peiping, invaded 
Central China and occupied Shanghai. Like the Japanese invasion of 
Manchuria several years earlier, the invasion of Central China was 
effected by the customary Japanese method, in robber fashion, by the 
dishonest exploitation of various ³local incidents² engineered by the 
Japanese themselves, and in violation of all ³international standards,² 
treaties, agreements, etc. The seizure of Tientsin and Shanghai placed 
the keys of the immense China market in the hands of Japan. As long 
as Japan holds Shanghai and Tientsin, she can at any moment oust 
Great Britain and the U.S.A. from Central China, where they have 
huge investments. 
Of course, the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and their army 
against the Japanese invaders, the tremendous national revival in China, 
her huge resources of man-power and territory, and, lastly, the determination 
of the Chinese National Government to fight the struggle for 
emancipation to a finish, until the invaders are completely driven out 
from Chinese territory, all go to show beyond a doubt that there is 
no future for the Japanese imperialists in China, and never will be. 
But it is nevertheless true that for the time being Japan holds the 
keys of China¹s trade, and that her war on China is in effect a most 
serious blow at the interests of Great Britain and the U.S.A. 
Thus, in the Pacific, in the zone of China, one more war knot was 
tied.
All these facts show that a second imperialist war has actually begun. 
It began stealthily, without any declaration of war. States and 
nations have, almost imperceptibly, slipped into the orbit of a second 
imperialist war. It was the three aggressor states, the fascist ruling 
circles of Germany, Italy and Japan, that began the war in various parts 
of the world. It is being waged over a huge expanse of territory, stretching 
from Gibraltar to Shanghai. It has already drawn over five hundred 
million people into its orbit. In the final analysis, it is being waged 
against the capitalist interests of Great Britain, France and the U.S.A., 
since its object is a redivision of the world and of the spheres of influence 
in favour of the aggressor countries and at the expense of the so-called 
democratic states. 
A distinguishing feature of the second imperialist war is that so far

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 334 
it is being waged and extended by the aggressor powers, while the other 
powers, the ³democratic² powers, against whom in fact the war is 
directed, pretend that it does not concern them, wash their hands of it, 
draw back, boast of their love of peace, scold the fascist aggressors, 
and . . . surrender their positions to the aggressors bit by bit, at the same 
time asserting that they are preparing to resist. 
This war, it will be seen, is of a rather strange and one-sided character. 
But that does not prevent it from being a brutal war of unmitigated 
conquest waged at the expense of the poorly defended peoples of 
Ethiopia, Spain and China. 
It would be wrong to attribute this one-sided character of the war 
to the military or economic weakness of the ³democratic² states. The 
³democratic² states are, of course, stronger than the fascist states. The 
one-sided character of the developing world war is due to the absence 
of a united front of the ³democratic² states against the fascist powers. 
The so-called democratic states, of course, do not approve of the ³excesses² 
of the fascist states and fear any accession of strength to the 
latter. But they fear even more the working-class movement in Europe 
and the movement of national emancipation in Asia, and regard fascism 
as an ³excellent antidote² to these ³dangerous² movements. For this 
reason the ruling circles of the ³democratic² states, especially the ruling 
Conservative circles of Great Britain, confine themselves to a policy of 
pleading with the overweening fascist rulers ³not to go to extremes,² 
at the same time giving them to understand that they ³fully comprehend² 
and on the whole sympathize with their reactionary police policy towards 
the working-class movement and the national emancipation movement. 
In this respect, the ruling circles of Britain are roughly pursuing the 
same policy as was pursued under tsardom by the Russian liberal-monarchist 
bourgeois, who, while fearing the ³excesses² of tsarist policy, 
feared the people even more, and therefore resorted to a policy of 
pleading with the tsar and, consequently, of conspiring with the tsar 
against the people. As we know, the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie of 
Russia paid dearly for this dual policy. It may be presumed that history 
will exact retribution also from the ruling circles of Britain, and of 
their friends in France and the U.S.A. 
Clearly, the U.S.S.R. could not shut its eyes to such a turn in the 
international situation and ignore the ominous events. Any war, however 
small, started by the aggressors, constitutes a menace to the peaceable 
countries. The second imperialist war, which has so ³imperceptibly² 
stolen upon the nations and has involved over five hundred million people, 
is bound all the more to represent a most serious danger to all nations,

335 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
and to the U.S.S.R. in the first place. This is eloquently borne out by 
the formation of the ³Anti-Communist Bloc² by Germany, Italy and 
Japan. Therefore, our country, while pursuing its policy of peace, set 
to work to further strengthen its frontier defences and the fighting efficiency 
of its Red Army and Navy. Towards the end of 1934 the U.S.S.R. 
joined the League of Nations. It did so in the knowledge that the League in spite 
of its weakness, might nevertheless serve as a place where aggressors 
can be exposed, and as a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, 
that might hinder the outbreak of war. The Soviet Union considered 
that in times like these even so weak an international organization as the 
League of Nations should not be ignored. In May 1935 a treaty of 
mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between 
France and the U.S.S.R. A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded 
between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. In March 1936 the 
U.S.S.R. signed a treaty of mutual assistance with the Mongolian People¹s 
Republic, and in August 1937 a pact of non-aggression with the Republic 
of China. 
2. FURTHER PROGRESS OF INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE IN THE 
U.S.S.R. SECOND FIVE-YEAR PLAN FULFILLED AHEAD OF TIME. 
RECONSTRUCTION OF AGRICULTURE AND COMPLETION OF 
COLLECTIVIZATION. IMPORTANCE OF CADRES. STAKHANOV 
MOVEMENT. RISING STANDARD OF WELFARE. RISING CULTURAL 
STANDARD. STRENGTH OF THE SOVIET REVOLUTION 
Whereas, three years after the economic crisis of 1930-33, a new 
economic crisis began in the capitalist countries, in the U.S.S.R. industry 
continued to make steady progress during the whole of this period. 
Whereas by the middle of 1937 world capitalist industry, as a whole, 
had barely attained 95-96 per cent of the level of production of 1929, 
only to be caught in the throes of a new crisis in the second half of 1937, 
the industry of the U.S.S.R. in its steady cumulative progress, had by 
the end of 1937 attained 428 per cent of the output of 1929, or over 
700 per cent of the pre-war output. 
These achievements were a direct result of the policy of reconstruction 
so persistently pursued by the Party and the Government. 
The result of these achievements was that the Second Five-Year 
Plan of industry was fulfilled ahead of time. It was completed by 
April 1, 1937, that is, in four years and three months. 
This was a most important victory for Socialism. 
Progress in agriculture presented very much the same picture. The

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 336

DISTRIBUTION 
total area under all crops increased from I05,000,000 hectares in I9I3 
(pre-war) to I35,000,000 hectares in I937. The grain harvest increased 
from 4,800,000,000 poods in I9I3, to 6,800,000,000 poods in 
I937, the raw cotton crop from 44,000,000 poods to I54,000,000 
poods, the flax crop (fibre) from I9,000,000 poods to 3I,000,000 poods, 
the sugar-beet crop from 654,000,000 poods to I,3II,000,000 poods, 
and the oil-seed crop from I29,000,000 poods to 306,000,000 poods. 
It should be mentioned that in I937 the collective farms alone 
(without the state farms) produced a marketable surplus of over 
I,700,000,000 poods of grain, which was at least 400,000,000 poods 
more than the landlords, kulaks and peasants together marketed in I9I3. 
Only one branch of agriculturelivestock farmingstill lagged behind 
the pre-war level and continued to progress at a slower rate. 
As to collectivization in agriculture, it might be considered completed. 
The number of peasant households that had joined the collective 
farms by I937 was I8,500,000 or 93 per cent of the total number of 
peasant households, while the grain crop area of the collective farms 
amounted to 99 per cent of the total grain crop area of the peasants. 
The fruits of the reconstruction of agriculture and of the extensive 
supply of tractors and machinery for agricultural purposes were now 
manifest. 
As a result of the completion of the reconstruction of industry and 
agriculture the national economy was now abundantly supplied with 
first-class technique. Industry, agriculture, the transport system and the 
army had received huge quantities of modern techniquemachinery and 
machine tools, tractors and agricultural machines, locomotives and steamships, 
artillery and tanks, aeroplanes and warships. Tens and hundreds of 
thousands of trained people were required, people capable of harnessing all 
this technique and getting the most out of it. Without this, without a sufficient 
number of people who had mastered technique, there was a risk 
of technique becoming so much dead and unused metal. This was a 
serious danger, a result of the fact that the growth in the number of 
trained people, cadres, capable of harnessing, making full use of technique 
was not keeping pace with, and even lagging far behind, the 
spread of technique. Matters were further complicated by the fact 
that a considerable number of our industrial executives did not realize 
this danger and believed that technique would just ³do the job by itself.² 
Whereas, formerly, they had underrated the importance of technique 
and treated it with disdain, now they began to overrate it and turn it 
into a fetish. They did not realize that without people who had mastered 
technique, technique was a dead thing. They did not realize that

337 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
to make technique highly productive, people who had mastered technique 
were required. 
Thus the problem of cadres who had mastered technique became one 
of prime importance. 
The executives who displayed an excessive zeal for technique and 
a consequent underestimation of the importance of trained people, cadres, 
had to have their attention turned to the study and mastery of technique, 
and to the necessity of doing everything to train numerous cadres capable 
of harnessing technique and getting the most out of it. 
Whereas formerly, at the beginning of the reconstruction period, 
when the country suffered from a dearth of technique, the Party had 
issued the slogan, ³technique in the period of reconstruction decides 
everything,² now, when there was an abundance of technique, when 
the reconstruction had in the main been completed, and when the country 
was experiencing an acute dearth of cadres, it became incumbent 
on the Party to issue a new slogan, one that would focus attention, 
not so much on technique, as on people, on cadres capable of utilizing 
technique to the full. 
Of great importance in this respect was the speech made by Comrade 
Stalin to the graduates from the Red Army Academies in May 1935. 
³Formerly,² said Comrade Stalin, ³we used to say that technique 
decides everything.¹ This slogan helped us to put an end to the 
dearth in technique and to create a vast technical base in every 
branch of activity for the equipment of our people with first-class 
technique. That is very good. But it is not enough, it is not enough 
by far. In order to set technique going and to utilize it to the full, 
we need people who have mastered technique, we need cadres capable 
of mastering and utilizing this technique according to all the 
rules of the art. Without people who have mastered technique, 
technique is dead. In the charge of people who have mastered 
technique, technique can and should perform miracles. If in our 
first-class mills and factories, in our state farms and collective farms 
and in our Red Army we had sufficient cadres capable of harnessing 
this technique, our country would secure results three times and 
four times as great as at present. That is why emphasis must now 
be laid on people, on cadres, on workers who have mastered technique. 
That is why the old slogan, technique decides everything,¹ 
which is a reflection of a period already passed, a period in which 
we suffered from a dearth of technique, must now be replaced by 
a new slogan, the slogan cadres decide everything.¹ That is the 
main thing now. . . .

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 338 
³It is time to realize that of all the valuable capital the world 
possesses, the most valuable and most decisive is people, cadres. It 
must be realized that under our present conditions cadres decide 
everything.¹ If we have good and numerous cadres in industry, agriculture, 
transport and the armyour country will be invincible. If 
we do not have such cadreswe shall be lame on both legs.² 
Thus the prime task now was to accelerate the training of technical 
cadres and rapidly to master the new technique with the object of securing 
a continued rise in productivity of labour. 
The most striking example of the growth of such cadres, of the 
mastering of the new technique by our people, and of the continued 
rise in productivity of labour was the Stakhanov movement. It originated 
and developed in the Donetz Basin, in the coal industry, and spread to 
other branches of industry, to the railways, and then to agriculture. It 
was called the Stakhanov movement after its originator, Alexei Stakhanov, 
a coal-hewer in the Central Irmino Colliery (Donetz Basin). Stakhanov 
had been preceded by Nikita Izotov, who had broken all previous 
records in coal hewing. On August 31, 1935, Stakhanov hewed 102 
tons of coal in one shift and thus fulfilled the standard output fourteen 
times over. This inaugurated a mass movement of workers and collective 
farmers for raising the standards of output, for a new advance in productivity 
of labour. Busygin in the automobile industry, Smetanin in 
the shoe industry, Krivonoss on the railways, Musinsky in the timber 
industry, Evdokia Vinogradova and Maria Vinogradova in the textile 
industry, Maria Demchenko, Maria Gnatenko, P. Angelina, Polagutin, 
Kolesov, Borin and Kovardak in agriculturethese were the first pioneers 
of the Stakhanov movement. 
They were followed by other pioneers, whole battalions of them, who 
surpassed the productivity of labour of the earlier pioneers. 
Tremendous stimulus was given to the Stakhanov movement by the 
First All-Union Conference of Stakhanovites held in the Kremlin in 
November 1935, and by the speech Comrade Stalin made there. 
³The Stakhanov movement,² Comrade Stalin said in this speech, 
³is the expression of a new wave of Socialist emulation, a new and 
higher stage of Socialist emulation. . . . In the past, some three 
years ago, in the period of the first stage of Socialist emulation, 
Socialist emulation was not necessarily associated with modern 
technique. At that time, in fact, we had hardly any modern technique. 
The present stage of Socialist emulation, the Stakhanov 
movement, on the other hand, is necessarily associated with modern

339 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
technique. The Stakhanov movement would be inconceivable without 
a new and higher technique. We have before us people like 
Comrade Stakhanov, Busygin, Smetanin, Krivonoss, the Vinogradovas 
and many others, new people, working men and women, who 
have completely mastered the technique of their jobs, have harnessed 
it and driven ahead. We had no such people, or hardly any such 
people, some three years ago. . . . The significance of the Stakhanov 
movement lies in the fact that it is a movement which is 
smashing the old technical standards, because they are inadequate, 
which in a number of cases is surpassing the productivity of labour 
of the foremost capitalist countries, and is thus creating the practical 
possibility of further consolidating Socialism in our country, of converting 
our country into the most prosperous of all countries.² 
Describing the methods of work of the Stakhanovites, and bringing 
out the tremendous significance of the Stakhanov movement for the 
future of our country, Comrade Stalin went on to say: 
³Look at our comrades, the Stakhanovites, more closely. What 
type of people are they? They are mostly young or middle-aged 
working men and women, people with culture and technical knowledge, 
who show examples of precision and accuracy in work, who 
are able to appreciate the time factor in work and who have learned 
to count not only the minutes, but also the seconds. The majority 
of them have taken the technical minimum courses and are continuing 
their technical education. They are free of the conservatism 
and stagnation of certain engineers, technicians and business executives; 
they are marching boldly forward, smashing the antiquated 
technical standards and creating new and higher standards; 
they are introducing amendments into the designed capacities and 
economic plans drawn up by the leaders of our industry; they 
often supplement and correct what the engineers and technicians 
have to say, they often teach them and impel them forward, for 
they are people who have completely mastered the technique of 
their job and who are able to squeeze out of technique the maximum 
that can- be squeezed out of it. Today the Stakhanovites are still 
few in number, but who can doubt that tomorrow there will be 
ten times more of them? Is it not clear that the Stakhanovites 
are innovators in our industry, that the Stakhanov movement represents 
the future of our industry, that it contains the seed of the 
future rise in the cultural and technical level of the working class, 
that it opens to us the path by which alone can be achieved those

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 340
high indices of productivity of labour which are essential for the 
transition from Socialism to Communism and for the elimination of 
the distinction between mental labour and manual labour.² 
The spread of the Stakhanov movement and the fulfillment of the 
Second Five-Year Plan ahead of time created the conditions for a new 
rise in the standard of welfare and culture of the working people. 
During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan real wages of 
workers and office employees had more than doubled. The total payroll 
increased from 34,000,000,000 rubles in 1933 to 81,000,000,000 
rubles in 1937. The state social insurance fund increased from 
4,600,000,000 rubles to 5,600,000,000 rubles in the same period. In 
1937 alone, about 10,000,000,000 rubles were expended on the state 
insurance of workers and employees, on improving living conditions and 
on meeting cultural requirements, on sanatoria, health resorts, rest homes 
and on medical service. 
In the countryside, the collective farm system had been definitely 
consolidated. This was greatly assisted by the Rules of the Agricultural 
Artel, adopted by the Second Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers 
in February 1935, and the assignment to the collective farms of the 
land cultivated by them in perpetual tenure. The consolidation of the 
collective farm system put an end to poverty and insecurity among the 
rural population. Whereas formerly, some three years earlier, the collective 
farmers had received one or two kilograms of grain per work-dayunit, 
now the majority of the collective farmers in the grain-growing 
regions were receiving from five to twelve kilograms, and many as much 
as twenty kilograms per work-day-unit, besides other kinds of produce 
and money income. There were millions of collective farm households 
in the grain-growing regions who now received as their yearly returns 
from 500 to 1,500 poods of grain, and in the cotton, sugar beet, flax, 
livestock, grape growing, citrus fruit growing and fruit and vegetable 
growing regions, tens of thousands of rubles in annual income. The collective 
farms had become prosperous. It was now the chief concern of 
the household of a collective farmer to build new granaries and storehouses, 
inasmuch as the old storage places, which were designed for a 
meagre annual supply, no longer met even one-tenth of the household¹s 
requirements. 
In 1936, in view of the rising standard of welfare of the people, 
the government passed a law prohibiting abortion, at the same time 
adopting an extensive program for the building of maternity homes, 
nurseries, milk centres and kindergartens. In 1936, 2,174,000,000 
rubles were assigned for these measures, as compared with 875,000,000

341 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
rubles in 1935. A law was passed providing for considerable grants to 
large families. Grants to a total of over 1,000,000,000 rubles were 
made in 1937 under this law. 
The introduction of universal compulsory education and the building 
of new schools led to the rapid cultural progress of the people. Schools 
were built in large numbers all over the country. The number of pupils 
in elementary and intermediate schools increased from 8,000,000 in 
1914 to 28,000,000 in the school year 1936-37. The number of university 
students increased from 112,000 to 542,000 in the same period. 
This was a veritable cultural revolution. 
The rise in the standard of welfare and culture of the masses was a 
reflection of the strength, might and invincibility of our Soviet revolution. 
Revolutions in the past perished because, while giving the people 
freedom, they were unable to bring about any serious improvement in 
their material and cultural conditions. Therein lay their chief weakness. 
Our revolution differs from all other revolutions in that it not only 
freed the people from tsardom and capitalism, but also brought about 
a radical improvement in the welfare and cultural condition of the 
people. Therein lies its strength and invincibility. 
³Our proletarian revolution,² said Comrade Stalin at the First 
All-Union Conference of Stakhanovites, ³is the only revolution in 
the world which had the opportunity of showing the people not only 
political results but also material results. Of all workers¹ revolutions 
we know only one which managed to achieve power. That 
was the Paris Commune. But it did not last long. True, it endeavoured 
to smash the fetters of capitalism, but it did not have 
time enough to smash them, and still less to show the people the 
beneficial material results of revolution. Our revolution is the only 
one which not only smashed the fetters of capitalism and brought 
the people freedom, but also succeeded in creating the material conditions 
of a prosperous life for the people. Therein lies the strength 
and invincibility of our revolution.² 
3. EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS. ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION 
OF THE U.S.S.R. 
In February 1935, the Seventh Congress of Soviets of the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics passed a decision to change the Constitution 
of the U.S.S.R. which had been adopted in 1924. The change of 
the Constitution was necessitated by the vast changes that had taken

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 342 
place in the life of the U.S.S.R. since the first Constitution of the Soviet 
Union had been adopted in 1924. During this period the relation of 
class forces within the country had completely changed; a new Socialist 
industry had been created, the kulaks had been smashed, the collective 
farm system had triumphed, and the Socialist ownership of the means of 
production had been established in every branch of national economy as 
the basis of Soviet society. The victory of Socialism made possible the 
further democratization of the electoral system and the introduction of 
universal, equal and direct suffrage with secret ballot. 
The new Constitution of the U.S.S.R. was drafted by a Constitution 
Commission set up for the purpose, under the chairmanship of Comrade 
Stalin. The draft was thrown open to nationwide discussion, which 
lasted five and a half months. It was then submitted to the Extraordinary 
Eighth Congress of Soviets. 
The Eighth Congress of Soviets, specially convened to approve or 
reject the draft of the new Constitution of the U.S.S.R., met in November 
1936. 
Reporting to the congress on the draft of the new Constitution, 
Comrade Stalin enumerated the principal changes that had taken place 
in the Soviet Union since the adoption of the 1924 Constitution. 
The 1924 Constitution had been drawn up in the early period of 
NEP. At that time the Soviet Government still permitted the develop 
ent of capitalism alongside of the development of Socialism. The 
Soviet Government planned in the course of competition between the 
two systemsthe capitalist system and the Socialist systemto organize 
and ensure the victory of Socialism over capitalism in the economic 
field. The question, ³Who will win?² had not yet been settled. Industry, 
with its old and inadequate technical equipment, had not attained 
even the pre-war level. Even less enviable was the picture presented by 
agriculture. The state farms and collective farms were mere islands in 
a boundless ocean of individual peasant farms. The question then was 
not of eliminating the kulaks, but merely of restricting them. The 
Socialist sector accounted for only about 50 per cent of the country¹s 
trade. 
Entirely different was the picture presented by the U.S.S.R. in 1936. 
By that time the economic life of the country had undergone a complete 
change. The capitalist elements had been entirely eliminated and the 
Socialist system had triumphed in all spheres of economic life. There 
was now a powerful Socialist industry which had increased output seven 
times compared with the pre-war output and had completely ousted 
private industry. Mechanized Socialist farming in the form of collective

343 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
farms and state farms, equipped with up-to-date machinery and run on 
the largest scale in the world, had triumphed in agriculture. By 1936, 
the kulaks had been completely eliminated as a class, and the individual 
peasants no longer played any important role in the economic life of 
the country. Trade was entirely concentrated in the hands of the state 
and the co-operatives. The exploitation of man by man had been abolished 
forever. Public, Socialist ownership of the means of production 
had been firmly established as the unshakable foundation of the new, 
Socialist system in all branches of economic life. In the new, Socialist 
society, crises, poverty, unemployment and destitution had disappeared 
forever. The conditions had been created for a prosperous and cultured 
life for all members of Soviet society. 
The class composition of the population of the Soviet Union, said 
Comrade Stalin in his report, had changed correspondingly. The landlord 
class and the old big imperialist bourgeoisie had already been eliminated 
in the period of the Civil War. During the years of Socialist construction 
all the exploiting elementscapitalists, merchants, kulaks and 
profiteershad been eliminated. Only insignificant remnants of the 
eliminated exploiting classes persisted, and their complete elimination was 
a matter of the very near future. 
The working people of the U.S.S.R.workers, peasants and intellectuals
had undergone profound change in the period of Socialist construction. 
The working class had ceased to be an exploited class bereft of 
means of production, as it is under capitalism. It had abolished capitalism, 
taken away the means of production from the capitalists and turned 
them into public property. It had ceased to be a proletariat in the proper, 
the old meaning of the term. The proletariat of the U.S.S.R., possessing 
the state power, had been transformed into an entirely new class. It 
had become a working class emancipated from exploitation, a working 
class which had abolished the capitalist economic system and had established 
Socialist ownership of the means of production. Hence, it was a 
working class the like of which the history of mankind had never known 
before. 
No less profound were the changes that had taken place in the 
condition of the peasantry of the U.S.S.R. In the old days, over twenty 
million scattered individual peasant households, small and middle, had 
delved away in isolation on their small plots, using backward technical 
equipment. They were exploited by landlords, kulaks, merchants, profiteers, 
usurers, etc. Now an entirely new peasantry had grown up in 
the U.S.S.R. There were no longer any landlords, kulaks, merchants

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 344 
and usurers to exploit the peasants. The overwhelming majority of the 
peasant households had joined the collective farms, which were based 
not on private ownership, but on collective ownership of the means of 
production, collective ownership which had grown from collective labour. 
This was a new type of peasantry, a peasantry emancipated from all 
exploitation. It was a peasantry the like of which the history of mankind 
had never known before. 
The intelligentsia in the U.S.S.R. had also undergone a change. 
It had for the most part become an entirely new intelligentsia. The 
majority of its members came from the ranks of the workers and peasants. 
It no longer served capitalism, as the old intelligentsia did; it 
served Socialism. It had become an equal member of the Socialist society. 
Together with the workers and peasants, it was building a new Socialist 
society. This was a new type of intelligentsia, which served the people 
and was emancipated from all exploitation. It was an intelligentsia the 
like of which the history of mankind had never known before. 
Thus the old class dividing lines between the working people of the 
U.S.S.R. were being obliterated, the old class exclusiveness was disappearing. 
The economic and political contradictions between the workers, 
the peasants and the intellectuals were declining and becoming obliterated. 
The foundation for the moral and political unity of society had 
been created. 
These profound changes in the life of the U.S.S.R., these decisive 
achievements of Socialism in the U.S.S.R., were reflected in the new 
Constitution. 
According to the new Constitution, Soviet society consists of two 
friendly classesthe workers and peasantsclass distinctions between 
the two still remaining. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a 
Socialist state of workers and peasants. 
The political foundation of the U.S.S.R. is formed by the Soviets 
of Deputies of the Working People, which developed and grew strong 
as a result of the overthrow of the power of the landlords and capitalists 
and the achievement of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
All power in the U.S.S.R. belongs to the working people of town 
and country as represented by the Soviets of Deputies of the Working 
People. 
The highest organ of state power in the U.S.S.R. is the Supreme 
Soviet of the U.S.S.R. 
The Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., consisting of two Chambers 
with equal rights, the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities,

345 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
is elected by the citizens of the U.S.S.R. for a term of four years on the 
basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. 
Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., as to all Soviets of 
Deputies of the Working People, are universal. This means that all 
citizens of the U.S.S.R. who have reached the age of eighteen, irrespective 
of race or nationality, religion, standard of education, domicile, 
social origin, property status or past activities, have the right to vote in 
the election of deputies and to be elected, with the exception of the insane 
and persons convicted by court of law to sentences including deprivation 
of electoral rights. 
Elections of deputies are equal. This means that each citizen is entitled 
to one vote and that all citizens participate in the elections on an 
equal footing. 
Elections of deputies are direct. This means that all Soviets of Deputies 
of the Working People, from rural and city Soviets of Deputies of 
the Working People up to and including the Supreme Soviet of the 
U.S.S.R., are elected by the citizens by direct vote. 
The Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. at a joint sitting of both 
Chambers elects the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council 
of People¹s Commissars of the U.S.S.R. 
The economic foundation of the U.S.S.R. is the Socialist system of 
economy and the Socialist ownership of the means of production. In 
the U.S.S.R. is realized the Socialist principle: ³From each according 
to his ability, to each according to his work.² 
All citizens of the U.S.S.R. are guaranteed the right to work, the 
right to rest and leisure, the right to education, the right to maintenance 
in old age and in case of sickness or disability. 
Women are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of life. 
The equality of the citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their 
nationality or race, is an indefeasible law. 
Freedom of conscience and freedom of anti-religious propaganda is 
recognized for all citizens. 
In order to strengthen Socialist society, the Constitution guarantees 
freedom of speech, press, assembly and meeting, the right to unite in 
public organizations, inviolability of person, inviolability of domicile and 
privacy of correspondence, the right of asylum for foreign citizens persecuted 
for defending the interests of the working people or for their 
scientific activities, or for their struggle for national liberation. 
The new Constitution also imposes serious duties on all citizens of 
the U.S.S.R.: the duty of observing the laws, maintaining labour discipline, 
honestly performing public duties, respecting the rules of the

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 346 
Socialist community, safeguarding and strengthening public, Socialist 
property, and defending the Socialist fatherland. 
³To defend the fatherland is the sacred duty of every citizen 
of the U.S.S.R.² 
Dealing with the right of citizens to unite in various societies, one 
of the articles of the Constitution states: 
³The most active and politically conscious citizens in the ranks 
of the working class and other strata of the working people unite in 
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), which is 
the vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen 
and develop the Socialist system and which represents the leading 
core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state.² 
The Eighth Congress of Soviets unanimously approved and adopted 
the draft of the new Constitution of the U.S.S.R. 
The Soviet country thus acquired a new Constitution, a Constitution 
embodying the victory of Socialism and workers¹ and peasants¹ democracy. 
In this way the Constitution gave legislative embodiment to the 
epoch-making fact that the U.S.S.R. had entered a new stage of development, 
the stage of the completion of the building of a Socialist society 
and the gradual transition to Communist society, where the guiding 
principle of social life will be the Communist principle: ³From each 
according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.²

GANG OF SPIES, WRECKERS AND TRAITORS TO THE COUNTRY. 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE ELECTION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET 
OF THE U.S.S.R. BROAD INNER-PARTY DEMOCRACY AS THE 
PARTY¹S COURSE. ELECTION OF SUPREME SOVIET OF U.S.S.R. 
In 1937, new facts came to light regarding the fiendish crimes of 
the Bukharin-Trotsky gang. The trial of Pyatakov, Radek and others, 
the trial of Tukhachevsky, Yakir and others, and, lastly, the trial of 
Bukharin, Rykov, Krestinsky, Rosengoltz and others, all showed that 
the Bukharinites and Trotskyites had long ago joined to form a common 
band of enemies of the people, operating as the ³Bloc of Rights and 
Trotskyites.² 
The trials showed that these dregs of humanity, in conjunction with

347 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
the enemies of the people, Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev, had been 
in conspiracy against Lenin, the Party and the Soviet state ever since 
the early days of the October Socialist Revolution. The insidious attempts 
to thwart the Peace of Brest-Litovsk at the beginning of 1918 
the plot against Lenin and the conspiracy with the ³Left² Socialist- 
Revolutionaries for the arrest and murder of Lenin, Stalin and Sverdlov 
in the spring of 1918, the villainous shot that wounded Lenin in the 
summer of 1918, the revolt of the ³Left² Socialist-Revolutionaries in 
the summer of 1918, the deliberate aggravation of differences in the 
Party in 1921 with the object of undermining and overthrowing Lenin¹s 
leadership from within, the attempts to overthrow the Party leadership 
during Lenin¹s illness and after his death, the betrayal of state secrets 
and the supply of information of an espionage character to foreign 
espionage services, the vile assassination of Kirov, the acts of wrecking, 
diversion and explosions, the dastardly murder of Menzhinsky, Kuibyshev 
and Gorkyall these and similar villainies over a period of 
twenty years were committed, it transpired, with the participation or 
under the direction of Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Rykov 
and their henchmen, at the behest of espionage services of bourgeois 
states. 
The trials brought to light the fact that the Trotsky-Bukharin 
fiends, in obedience to the wishes of their mastersthe espionage services 
of foreign stateshad set out to destroy the Party and the Soviet state, 
to undermine the defensive power of the country, to assist foreign military 
intervention, to prepare the way for the defeat of the Red Army, 
to bring about the dismemberment of the U.S.S.R., to hand over the 
Soviet Maritime Region to the Japanese, Soviet Byelorussia to the Poles, 
and the Soviet Ukraine to the Germans, to destroy the gains of the 
workers and collective farmers, and to restore capitalist slavery in the 
U.S.S.R. 
These Whiteguard pigmies, whose strength was no more than that 
of a gnat, apparently flattered themselves that they were the masters 
of the country, and imagined that it was really in their power to sell 
or give away the Ukraine, Byelorussia and the Maritime Region. 
These Whiteguard insects forgot that the real masters of the Soviet 
country were the Soviet people, and that the Rykovs, Bukharins, Zinovievs 
and Kamenevs were only temporary employees of the state, which 
could at any moment sweep them out from its offices as so much useless 
rubbish. 
These contemptible lackeys of the fascists forgot that the Soviet 
people had only to move a finger, and not a trace of them would be left.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 348
The Soviet court sentenced the Bukharin-Trotsky fiends to be shot. 
The People¹s Commissariat of Internal Affairs carried out the sentence. 
The Soviet people approved the annihilation of the Bukharin-Trotsky 
gang and passed on to next business. 
And the next business was to prepare for the election of the Supreme 
Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and to carry it out in an organized way. 
The Party threw all its strength into the preparations for the elections. 
It held that the putting into effect of the new Constitution of 
the U.S.S.R. signified a turn in the political life of the country. This 
turn meant the complete democratization of the electoral system, the 
substitution of universal suffrage for restricted suffrage, equal suffrage 
for not entirely equal suffrage, direct elections for indirect elections, and 
secret ballot for open ballot. 
Before the introduction of the new Constitution there were restrictions 
of the franchise in the case of priests, former Whiteguards, former 
kulaks, and persons not engaged in useful labour. The new Constitution 
abolished all franchise restrictions for these categories of citizens by 
making the election of deputies universal. 
Formerly, the election of deputies had been unequal, inasmuch as 
the bases of representation for the urban and rural populations differed. 
Now, however, all necessity for restrictions of equality of the suffrage 
had disappeared and all citizens were given the right to take part in the 
elections on an equal footing. 
Formerly, the elections of the intermediate and higher organs of 
Soviet power were indirect. Now, however, under the new Constitution, 
all Soviets, from rural and urban up to and including the Supreme 
Soviet, were to be elected by the citizens directly. 
Formerly, deputies to the Soviets were elected by open ballot and 
the voting was for lists of candidates. Now, however, the voting for 
deputies was to be by secret ballot, and not by lists, but for individual 
candidates nominated in each electoral area. 
This was a definite turning point in the political life of the country. 
The new electoral system was bound to result, and actually did 
result, in an enhancement of the political activity of the people, in greater 
control by the masses over the organs of Soviet power, and in the 
increased responsibility of the organs of Soviet power to the people. 
In order to be fully prepared for this turn, the Party had to be its 
moving spirit, and the leading role of the Party in the forthcoming 
elections had to be fully ensured. But this could be done only if the Party 
organizations themselves became thoroughly democratic in their everyday

349 1 9 3 5 - 1 9 3 7 
work, only if they fully observed the principles of democratic centralism 
in their inner-Party life, as the Party Rules demanded, only if all organs 
of the Party were elected, only if criticism and self-criticism in the Party 
were developed to the full, only if the responsibility of the Party bodies 
to the members of the Party were complete, and if the members of the 
Party themselves became thoroughly active. 
A report made by Comrade Zhdanov at the plenum of the Central 
Committee at the end of February 1937 on the subject of preparing 
the Party organizations for the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the 
U.S.S.R. revealed the fact that a number of Party organizations were 
systematically violating the Party Rules and the principles of democratic 
centralism in their everyday work, substituting co-option for election, 
voting by lists for the voting for individual candidates, open ballot for 
secret ballot, etc. It was obvious that organizations in which such practices 
prevailed could not properly fulfil their tasks in the elections to the 
Supreme Soviet. It was therefore first of all necessary to put a stop 
to such anti-democratic practices in the Party organizations and to reorganize 
Party work on broad democratic lines. 
Accordingly, after hearing the report of Comrade Zhdanov, the 
Plenum of the Central Committee resolved: 
³a) To reorganize Party work on the basis of complete and 
unqualified observance of the principles of inner-Party democracy 
as prescribed by the Party Rules. 
³b) To put an end to the practice of co-opting members of 
Party Committees and to restore the principle of election of directing 
bodies of Party organizations as prescribed by the Party Rules. 
³c) To forbid voting by lists in the election of Party bodies; 
voting should be for individual candidates, all members of the Party 
being guaranteed the unlimited right to challenge candidates and to 
criticize them. 
³d) To introduce the secret ballot in the election of Party bodies. 
³e) To hold elections of Party bodies in all Party organizations, 
from the Party Committees of primary Party organizations to the 
territorial and regional committees and the Central Committees of 
the national Communist Parties, the elections to be completed not 
later than May 20. 
³f) To charge all Party organizations strictly to observe the 
provisions of the Party Rules with respect to the terms of office of 
Party bodies, namely: to hold elections in primary Party organizations 
once a year; in district and city organizationsonce a year;

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 350
in regional, territorial and republican organizationsevery eighteen 
months. 
³g) To ensure that Party organizations strictly adhere to the 
system of electing Party Committees at general factory meetings, 
and not to allow the latter to be replaced by delegate conferences. 
³h) To put a stop to the practice prevalent in a number of 
primary Party organizations whereby general meetings are virtually 
abolished and replaced by shop meetings and delegate conferences.² 
In this way the Party began its preparations for the forthcoming 
elections. 
This decision of the Central Committee was of tremendous political 
importance. Its significance lay not only in the fact that it inaugurated 
the Party¹s campaign in the election of the Supreme Soviet of the 
U.S.S.R., but also, and primarily, in the fact that it helped the Party 
organizations to reorganize their work, to apply the principles of inner- 
Party democracy, and to meet the elections to the Supreme Soviet fully 
prepared. 
The Party decided to make the idea of an election bloc of Communists 
and the non-Party masses the keynote of its policy in developing 
the election campaign. The Party entered the elections in a bloc, an 
alliance with the non-Party masses, by deciding to put up in the electoral 
areas joint candidates with the non-Party masses. This was something 
unprecedented and absolutely impossible in elections in bourgeois countries. 
But a bloc of Communists and the non-Party masses was something 
quite natural in our country, where hostile classes no longer exist 
and where the moral and political unity of all sections of the population 
is an incontestable fact. 
On December 7, 1937, the Central Committee of the Party issued 
an Address to the electors, which stated: 
³On December 12, 1937, the working people of the Soviet 
Union will, on the basis of our Socialist Constitution, elect their 
deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. The Bolshevik Party 
enters the elections in a bloc, an alliance with the non-Party workers, 
peasants, office employees and intellectuals. . . . The Bolshevik Party 
does not fence itself off from non-Party people, but, on the contrary, 
enters the elections in a bloc, an alliance, with the non-Party 
masses, in a bloc with the trade unions of the workers and office 
employees, with the Young Communist League and other non- 
Party organizations and societies. Consequently, the candidates will 
be the joint candidates of the Communists and the non-Party masse

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
every non-Party deputy will also be the deputy of the Communists, 
just as every Communist deputy will be the deputy of the non-Party 
masses.² 
The Address of the Central Committee concluded with the following 
appeal to the electors: 
³The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union (Bolsheviks) calls upon all Communists and sympathizers 
to vote for the non-Party candidates with the same unanimity as they 
should vote for the Communist candidates. 
³The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union (Bolsheviks) calls upon all non-Party electors to vote for 
the Communist candidates with the same unanimity as they will 
vote for the non-Party candidates. 
³The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union (Bolsheviks) calls upon all electors to appear at the polling 
stations on December I2, I937, as one man, to elect the deputies 
to the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. 
³There must not be a single elector who does not exercise his 
honourable right of electing deputies to the Supreme organ of the 
Soviet state. 
³There must not be a single active citizen who does not consider 
it his civic duty to assist in ensuring that all electors without exception 
take part in the elections of the Supreme Soviet. 
³December I2, I937, should be a great holiday celebrating the 
union of the working people of all the nations of the U.S.S.R. 
around the victorious banner of Lenin and Stalin.² 
On December I, I937, the eve of the elections, Comrade Stalin 
addressed the voters of the area in which he was nominated and described 
what type of public figures those whom the people choose, the deputies 
to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., should be. Comrade Stalin said: 
³The electors, the people, must demand that their deputies should 
remain equal to their tasks; that in their work they should not sink 
to the level of political philistines; that in their posts they should 
remain political figures of the Lenin type; that as public figures they 
should be as clear and definite as Lenin was; that they should be 
as fearless in battle and as merciless towards the enemies of the 
people as Lenin was; that they should be free from all panic, from 
any semblance of panic, when things begin to get complicated and

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 352 
some danger or other looms on the horizon, that they should be as 
free from all semblance of panic as Lenin was; that they should be 
as wise and deliberate in deciding complex problems requiring a comprehensive 
orientation and a comprehensive weighing of all pros and 
cons as Lenin was; that they should be as upright and honest as 
Lenin was; that they should love their people as Lenin did.² 
The elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. took place on 
December 12 amidst great enthusiasm. They were something more 
than elections; they were a great holiday celebrating the triumph of the 
Soviet people, a demonstration of the great friendship of the peoples of 
the U.S.S.R. 
Of a total of 94,000,000 electors, over 91,000,000, or 96.8 per 
cent, voted. Of this number 89,844,000, or 98.6 per cent, voted for 
the candidates of the bloc of the Communists and the non-Party masses. 
Only 632,000 persons, or less than one per cent, voted against the 
candidates of the bloc of the Communists and the non-Party masses. 
All the candidates of the bloc were elected without exception. 
Thus, 90,000,000 persons, by their unanimous vote, confirmed 
the victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. 
This was a remarkable victory for the bloc of the Communists and 
the non-Party masses. 
It was a triumph for the Bolshevik Party. 
It was a brilliant confirmation of the moral and political unity of 
the Soviet people, to which Comrade Molotov had referred in a historic 
speech he delivered on the occasion of the Twentieth Anniversary of 
the October Revolution.

C O N C L U S I O N 
What are the chief conclusions to be drawn from the historical path 
traversed by the Bolshevik Party? 
What does the history of the C.P.S.U.(B.) teach us? 
1) The history of the Party teaches us, first of all, that the victory 
of the proletarian revolution, the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
is impossible without a revolutionary party of the proletariat, a 
party free from opportunism, irreconcilable towards compromisers and 
capitulators, and revolutionary in its attitude towards the bourgeoisie and 
its state power. 
The history of the Party teaches us that to leave the proletariat 
without such a party means to leave it without revolutionary leadership; 
and to leave it without revolutionary leadership means to ruin the cause 
of the proletarian revolution. 
The history of the Party teaches us that the ordinary Social-Democratic 
Party of the West-European type, brought up under conditions 
of civil peace, trailing in the wake of the opportunists, dreaming of 
³social reforms,² and dreading social revolution, cannot be such a party. 
The history of the Party teaches us that only a party of the new 
type, a Marxist-Leninist party, a party of social revolution, a party 
capable of preparing the proletariat for decisive battles against the bourgeoisie 
and of organizing the victory of the proletarian revolution, can 
be such a party. 
The Bolshevik Party in the U.S.S.R. is such a party. 
³In the pre-revolutionary period,² Comrade Stalin says, ³in the 
period of more or less peaceful development, when the parties of the 
Second International were the predominant force in the workingclass 
movement and parliamentary forms of struggle were regarded 
as the principal forms, the party neither had nor could have had that 
great and decisive importance which it acquired afterwards, under 
conditions of open revolutionary battle. Defending the Second International 
against attacks made upon it, Kautsky says that the parties 
of the Second International are instruments of peace and not of 
war, and that for this very reason they were powerless to take any 
353

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 354 
important steps during the war, during the period of revolutionary 
action by the proletariat. That is quite true. But what does it mean? 
It means that the parties of the Second International are unfit for 
the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, that they are not militant 
parties of the proletariat, leading the workers to power, but 
election machines adapted for parliamentary elections and parliamentary 
struggle. This, in fact, explains why, in the days when the 
opportunists of the Second International were in the ascendancy, it 
was not the party but its parliamentary group that was the chief 
political organization of the proletariat. It is well known that the 
party at that time was really an appendage and subsidiary of the 
parliamentary group. It goes without saying that under such circumstances 
and with such a party at the helm there could be no 
question of preparing the proletariat for revolution. 
³But matters have changed radically with the dawn of the new 
period. The new period is one of open class collisions, of revolutionary 
action by the proletariat, of proletarian revolution, a period 
when forces are being directly mustered for the overthrow of imperialism 
and the seizure of power by the proletariat. In this period 
the proletariat is confronted with new tasks, the tasks of reorganizing 
all party work on new, revolutionary lines; of educating the workers 
in the spirit of revolutionary struggle for power; of preparing and 
moving up reserves; of establishing an alliance with the proletarians 
of neighbouring countries; of establishing firm ties with the liberation 
movement in the colonies and dependent countries, etc., etc. To 
think that these new tasks can be performed by the old Social- 
Democratic parties, brought up as they were in the peaceful conditions 
of parliamentarism, is to doom oneself to hopeless despair and 
inevitable defeat. If, with such tasks to shoulder, the proletariat 
remained under the leadership of the old parties it would be completely 
unarmed and defenceless. It goes without saying that the 
proletariat could not consent to such a state of affairs. 
³Hence the necessity for a new party, a militant party, a revolutionary 
party, one bold enough to lead the proletarians in the struggle 
for power, sufficiently experienced to find its bearings amidst the 
complex conditions of a revolutionary situation, and sufficiently 
flexible to steer clear of all submerged rocks in the path to its goal. 
³Without such a party it is useless even to think of overthrowing 
imperialism and achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
³This new party is the party of Leninism.² (Joseph Stalin, Leninism, 
Vol. I, pp. 87-8.)

355 CONCLUSION 
2) The history of the Party further teaches us that a party of the 
working class cannot perform the role of leader of its class, cannot perform 
the role of organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution, 
unless it has mastered the advanced theory of the working-class movement, 
the Marxist-Leninist theory. 
The power of the Marxist-Leninist theory lies in the fact that it 
enables the Party to find the right orientation in any situation, to understand 
the inner connection of current events, to foresee their course and 
to perceive not only how and in what direction they are developing in 
the present, but how and in what direction they are bound to develop 
in the future. 
Only a party which has mastered the Marxist-Leninist theory can 
confidently advance and lead the working class forward. 
On the other hand, a party which has not mastered the Marxist- 
Leninist theory is compelled to grope its way, loses confidence in its 
actions and is unable to lead the working class forward. 
It may seem that all that is required for mastering the Marxist- 
Leninist theory is diligently to learn by heart isolated conclusions and 
propositions from the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin, learn to quote 
them at opportune times and rest at that, in the hope that the conclusions 
and propositions thus memorized will suit each and every situation and 
occasion. But such an approach to the Marxist-Leninist theory is altogether 
wrong. The Marxist-Leninist theory must not be regarded as 
a collection of dogmas, as a catechism, as a symbol of faith, and the 
Marxists themselves as pedants and dogmatists. The Marxist-Leninist 
theory is the science of the development of society, the science of the 
working-class movement, the science of the proletarian revolution, the 
science of the building of the Communist society. And as a science it 
does not and cannot stand still, but develops and perfects itself. Clearly, 
in its development it is bound to become enriched by new experience and 
new knowledge, and some of its propositions and conclusions are bound 
to change in the course of time, are bound to be replaced by new conclusions 
and propositions corresponding to the new historical conditions. 
Mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory does not at all mean learning 
all its formulas and conclusions by heart and clinging to their every letter. 
To master the Marxist-Leninist theory we must first of all learn to 
distinguish between its letter and substance. 
Mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory means assimilating the substance 
of this theory and learning to use it in the solution of the practical 
problems of the revolutionary movement under the varying conditions 
of the class struggle of the proletariat.

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 356 
Mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory means being able to enrich 
this theory with the new experience of the revolutionary movement, 
with new propositions and conclusions, it means being able to develop it 
and advance it without hesitating to replacein accordance with the 
substance of the theorysuch of its propositions and conclusions as have 
become antiquated by new ones corresponding to the new historical 
situation. 
The Marxist-Leninist theory is not a dogma but a guide to action. 
Before the Second Russian Revolution (February 1917), the Marxists 
of all countries assumed that the parliamentary democratic republic 
was the most suitable form of political organization of society in the 
period of transition from capitalism to Socialism. It is true that in the 
seventies Marx stated that the most suitable form for the dictatorship 
of the proletariat was a political organization of the type of the Paris 
Commune, and not the parliamentary republic. But, unfortunately, 
Marx did not develop this proposition any further in his writings and it 
was committed to oblivion. Moreover, Engels¹ authoritative statement 
in his criticism of the draft of the Erfurt Program in 1891, namely, 
that ³the democratic republic . . . is . . . the specific form for the dictatorship 
of the proletariat² left no doubt that the Marxists continued to 
regard the democratic republic as the political form for the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. Engels¹ proposition later became a guiding principle 
for all Marxists, including Lenin. However, the Russian Revolution 
of 1905, and especially the Revolution of February 1917, advanced a 
new form of political organization of societythe Soviets of Workers¹ 
and Peasants¹ Deputies. As a result of a study of the experience of the 
two Russian revolutions, Lenin, on the basis of the theory of Marxism, 
arrived at the conclusion that the best political form for the dictatorship 
of the proletariat was not a parliamentary democratic republic, but a 
republic of Soviets. Proceeding from this, Lenin, in April 1917, during 
the period of transition from the bourgeois to the Socialist revolution, 
issued the slogan of a republic of Soviets as the best political form for the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. The opportunists of all countries clung to 
the parliamentary republic and accused Lenin of departing from Marxism 
and destroying democracy. But it was Lenin, of course, who was 
the real Marxist who had mastered the theory of Marxism, and not the 
opportunists, for Lenin was advancing the Marxist theory by enriching it 
with new experience, whereas the opportunists were dragging it back and 
transforming one of its propositions into a dogma. 
What would have happened to the Party, to our revolution, to Marxism, 
if Lenin had been overawed by the letter of Marxism and had not

had the courage to replace one of the old propositions of Marxism, formulated 
by Engels, by the new proposition regarding the republic of 
Soviets, a proposition that corresponded to the new historical conditions? 
The Party would have groped in the dark, the Soviets would have been 
disorganized, we should not have had a Soviet power, and the Marxist 
theory would have suffered a severe setback. The proletariat would 
have lost, and the enemies of the proletariat would have won. 
As a result of a study of pre-imperialist capitalism Engels and Marx 
arrived at the conclusion that the Socialist revolution could not be victorious 
in one country, taken singly, that it could be victorious only by 
a simultaneous stroke in all, or the majority of the civilized countries. 
That was in the middle of the nineteenth century. This conclusion 
later became a guiding principle for all Marxists. However, by the 
beginning of the twentieth century, pre-imperialist capitalism had grown 
into imperialist capitalism, ascendant capitalism had turned into moribund 
capitalism. As a result of a study of imperialist capitalism, Lenin, 
on the basis of the Marxist theory, arrived at the conclusion that the old 
formula of Engels and Marx no longer corresponded to the new historical 
conditions, and that the victory of the Socialist revolution was 
quite possible in one country, taken singly. The opportunists of all countries 
clung to the old formula of Engels and Marx and accused Lenin 
of departing from Marxism. But it was Lenin, of course, who was the 
real Marxist who had mastered the theory of Marxism, and not the 
opportunists, for Lenin was advancing the Marxist theory by enriching 
it with new experience, whereas the opportunists were dragging it back, 
mummifying it. 
What would have happened to the Party, to our revolution, to Marxism, 
if Lenin had been overawed by the letter of Marxism and had not 
had the courage of theoretical conviction to discard one of the old conclusions 
of Marxism and to replace it by a new conclusion affirming that 
the victory of Socialism in one country, taken singly, was possible, a conclusion 
which corresponded to the new historical conditions? The Party 
would have groped in the dark, the proletarian revolution would have 
been deprived of leadership, and the Marxist theory would have begun 
to decay. The proletariat would have lost, and the enemies of the proletariat 
would have won. 
Opportunism does not always mean a direct denial of the Marxist 
theory or of any of its propositions and conclusions. Opportunism is 
sometimes expressed in the attempt to cling to certain of the propositions 
of Marxism that have already become antiquated and to convert them 
into a dogma, so as to retard the further development of Marxism, and,

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 358 
consequently, to retard the development of the revolutionary movement 
of the proletariat. 
It may be said without fear of exaggeration that since the death of 
Engels the master theoretician Lenin, and after Lenin, Stalin and the 
other disciples of Lenin, have been the only Marxists who have advanced 
the Marxist theory and who have enriched it with new experience in 
the new conditions of the class struggle of the proletariat. 
And just because Lenin and the Leninists have advanced the Marxist 
theory, Leninism is a further development of Marxism; it is Marxism 
in the new conditions of the class struggle of the proletariat, Marxism 
of the epoch of imperialism and proletarian revolutions, Marxism of the 
epoch of the victory of Socialism on one-sixth of the earth¹s surface. 
The Bolshevik Party could not have won in October 1917 if its 
foremost men had not mastered the theory of Marxism, if they had not 
learned to regard this theory as a guide to action, if they had not learned 
to advance the Marxist theory by enriching it with the new experience of 
the class struggle of the proletariat. 
Criticizing the German Marxists in America who had undertaken 
to lead the American working-class movement, Engels wrote: 
³The Germans have not understood how to use their theory as 
a lever which could set the American masses in motion; they do not 
understand the theory themselves for the most part and treat it in 
a doctrinaire and dogmatic way, as something which has got to be 
learned off by heart and which will then supply all needs without 
more ado. To them it is a dogma and not a guide to action.² (Marx 
and Engels, Selected Correspondence, pp. 449-450.) 
Criticizing Kamenev and some of the old Bolsheviks who in April 
1917 clung to the old formula of a revolutionary democratic dictatorship 
of the proletariat and the peasantry at a time when the revolutionary 
movement had gone on ahead and was demanding a transition to the 
Socialist revolution, Lenin wrote: 
³Our teaching is not a dogma, but a guide to action, Marx and 
Engels always used to say, rightly ridiculing the learning and repetition 
by rote of formulas¹ which at best are only capable of outlining 
general tasks that are necessarily liable to be modified by the concrete 
economic and political conditions of each separate phase of the historical 
process. . . . It is essential to realize the incontestable truth 
that a Marxist must take cognizance of real life, of the concrete 
realities, and must not continue to cling to a theory of yesterday. . . .² 
(Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XX, pp. 100-101.)

3) The history of the Party further teaches us that unless the pettybourgeois 
parties which are active within the ranks of the working class 
and which push the backward sections of the working class into the 
arms of the bourgeoisie, thus splitting the unity of the working class, 
are smashed, the victory of the proletarian revolution is impossible. 
The history of our Party is the history of the struggle against the 
petty-bourgeois partiesthe Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, Anarchists 
and nationalistsand of the utter defeat of these parties. If these 
parties had not been vanquished and driven out of the ranks of the 
working class, the unity of the working class could not have been 
achieved; and if the working class had not been united, it would have 
been impossible to achieve the victory of the proletarian revolution. 
If these parties, which at first stood for the preservation of capitalism, 
and later, after the October Revolution, for the restoration of capitalism, 
had not been utterly defeated, it would have been impossible to preserve 
the dictatorship of the proletariat, to defeat the foreign armed intervention, 
and to build up Socialism. 
It cannot be regarded as an accident that all the petty-bourgeois 
parties, which styled themselves ³revolutionary² and ³socialist² parties 
in order to deceive the peoplethe Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, 
Anarchists and nationalistsbecame counter-revolutionary parties 
even before the October Socialist Revolution, and later turned into agents 
of foreign bourgeois espionage services, into a gang of spies, wreckers, 
diversionists, assassins and traitors to the country. 
³The unity of the proletariat in the epoch of social revolution,² 
Lenin says, ³can be achieved only by the extreme revolutionary 
party of Marxism, and only by a relentless struggle against all other 
parties.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXVI, p. 50.) 
4) The history of the Party further teaches us that unless the Party 
of the working class wages an uncompromising struggle against the 
opportunists within its own ranks, unless it smashes the capitulators in 
its own midst, it cannot preserve unity and discipline within its ranks, it 
cannot perform its role of organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution, 
nor its role as the builder of the new, Socialist society. 
The history of the development of the internal life of our Party is 
the history of the struggle against the opportunist groups within the 
Partythe ³Economists,² Mensheviks, Trotskyites, Bukharinites and 
nationalist deviatorsand of the utter defeat of these groups. 
The history of our Party teaches us that all these groups of capitulators 
were in point of fact agents of Menshevism within our Party,

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 360 
the lees and dregs of Menshevism, the continuers of Menshevism. Like 
the Mensheviks, they acted as vehicles of bourgeois influence among 
the working class and in the Party. The struggle for the liquidation of 
these groups within the Party was therefore a continuation of the struggle 
for the liquidation of Menshevism. 
If we had not defeated the ³Economists² and the Mensheviks, we 
could not have built the Party and led the working class to the proletarian 
revolution. 
If we had not defeated the Trotskyites and Bukharinites, we could 
not have brought about the conditions that are essential for the building 
of Socialism. 
If we had not defeated the nationalist deviators of all shades and 
colours, we could not have educated the people in the spirit of internationalism, 
we could not have safeguarded the banner of the great 
amity of the nations of the U.S.S.R., and we could not have built up 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 
It may seem to some that the Bolsheviks devoted far too much time 
to this struggle against the opportunist elements within the Party, that 
they overrated their importance. But that is altogether wrong. Opportunism 
in our midst is like an ulcer in a healthy organism, and must 
not be tolerated. The Party is the leading detachment of the working 
class, its advanced fortress, its general staff. Sceptics, opportunists, capitulators 
and traitors cannot be tolerated on the directing staff of the 
working class. If, while it is carrying on a life and death fight against 
the bourgeoisie, there are capitulators and traitors on its own staff, within 
its own fortress, the working class will be caught between two fires, from 
the front and the rear. Clearly, such a struggle can only end in defeat. 
The easiest way to capture a fortress is from within. To attain victory, 
the Party of the working class, its directing staff, its advanced fortress, 
must first be purged of capitulators, deserters, scabs and traitors. 
It cannot be regarded as an accident that the Trotskyites, Bukharinites 
and nationalist deviators who fought Lenin and the Party ended just 
as the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties did, namely, by 
becoming agents of fascist espionage services, by turning spies, wreckers, 
assassins, diversionists and traitors to the country. 
³With reformists, Mensheviks, in our ranks,² Lenin said, ³it is 
impossible to achieve victory in the proletarian revolution, it is impossible 
to retain it. That is obvious in principle, and it has been 
strikingly confirmed by the experience both of Russia and Hungary 
. . . In Russia, difficult situations have arisen many times, when the 
Soviet regime would most certainly have been overthrown had Men

sheviks, reformists and petty-bourgeois democrats remained in our 
Party. . . .² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXV, pp. 
462-63.) 
³Our Party,² Comrade Stalin says, ³succeeded in creating internal 
unity and unexampled cohesion of its ranks primarily because 
it was able in good time to purge itself of the opportunist pollution, 
because it was able to rid its ranks of the Liquidators, the Mensheviks. 
Proletarian parties develop and become strong by purging 
themselves of opportunists and reformists, social-imperialists and 
social-chauvinists, social-patriots and social-pacifists. The Party becomes 
strong by purging itself of opportunist elements.² (Joseph 
Stalin, Leninism.) 
5) The history of the Party further teaches us that a party cannot 
perform its role as leader of the working class if, carried away by success, 
it begins to grow conceited, ceases to observe the defects in its work, 
and fears to acknowledge its mistakes and frankly and honestly to correct 
them in good time. 
A party is invincible if it does not fear criticism and self-criticism, if 
it does not gloss over the mistakes and defects in its work, if it teaches 
and educates its cadres by drawing the lessons from the mistakes in 
Party work, and if it knows how to correct its mistakes in time. 
A party perishes if it conceals its mistakes, if it glosses over sore 
problems, if it covers up its shortcomings by pretending that all is well, 
if it is intolerant of criticism and self-criticism, if it gives way to selfcomplacency 
and vainglory and if it rests on its laurels. 
³The attitude of a political party towards its own mistakes,² 
Lenin says, ³is one of the most important and surest ways of judging 
how earnest the party is and how it in practice fulfils its obligations 
towards its class and the toiling masses. Frankly admitting a mistake, 
ascertaining the reasons for it, analysing the conditions which led to 
it, and thoroughly discussing the means of correcting itthat is the 
earmark of a serious party; that is the way it should perform its 
duties, that is the way it should educate and train the class, and then 
the masses.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXV, p. 200.) 
And further: 
³All revolutionary parties, which have hitherto perished, did so 
because they grew conceited, failed to see where their strength lay, 
and feared to speak of their weaknesses. But we shall not perish, 
for we do not fear to speak of our weaknesses and will learn to over

HISTORY OF C. P. S. U. 362
come them.² (Lenin, Collected Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXVII, 
pp. 260-61.) 
6) Lastly, the history of the Party teaches us that unless it has wide 
connections with the masses, unless it constantly strengthens these connections, 
unless it knows how to hearken to the voice of the masses and 
understand their urgent needs, unless it is prepared not only to teach 
the masses, but to learn from the masses, a party of the working class 
cannot be a real mass party capable of leading the working class millions 
and all the labouring people. 
A party is invincible if it is able, as Lenin says, ³to link itself with, 
to keep in close touch with, and, to a certain extent if you like, to merge 
with the broadest masses of the toilersprimarily with the proletariat, 
but also with the non-proletarian toiling masses.² (Lenin, Collected 
Works, Russ. ed., Vol. XXV, p. 174.) 
A party perishes if it shuts itself up in its narrow party shell, if it 
severs itself from the masses, if it allows itself to be covered with bureaucratic 
rust. 
³We may take it as the rule,² Comrade Stalin says, ³that as 
long as the Bolsheviks maintain connection with the broad masses of 
the people they will be invincible. And, on the contrary, as soon 
as the Bolsheviks sever themselves from the masses and lose their 
connection with them, as soon as they become covered with bureaucratic 
rust, they will lose all their strength and become a mere cipher. 
³In the mythology of the ancient Greeks there was a celebrated 
hero, Antæus, who, so the legend goes, was the son of Poseidon, 
god of the seas, and Gæa, goddess of the earth. Antæus was very 
much attached to the mother who had given birth to him, suckled 
him and reared him. There was not a hero whom this Antæus did 
not vanquish. He was regarded as an invincible hero. Wherein lay 
his strength? It lay in the fact that every time he was hard pressed 
in a fight with an adversary he would touch the earth, the mother 
who had given birth to him and suckled him, and that gave him 
new strength. Yet he had a vulnerable spotthe danger of being 
detached from the earth in some way or other. His enemies were 
aware of this weakness and watched for him. One day an enemy 
appeared who took advantage of this vulnerable spot and vanquished 
Antæus. This was Hercules. How did Hercules vanquish Antæus? 
He lifted him from the earth, kept him suspended in the air, prevented 
him from touching the earth, and throttled him. 
³I think that the Bolsheviks remind us of the hero of Greek

mythology, Antæus. They, like Antæus, are strong because they 
maintain connection with their mother, the masses, who gave birth 
to them, suckled them and reared them. And as long as they maintain 
connection with their mother, with the people, they have every 
chance of remaining invincible. 
³That is the key to the invincibility of Bolshevik leadership.² 
(J. Stalin, Mastering Bolshevism, pp. 58-60.) 
Such are the chief lessons to be drawn from the historical path traversed 
by the Bolshevik Party.
