PREFACE 
The ninth volume of the Works of J. V. Stalin contains 
writings and speeches of the period from December 
1926 to July 1927. 
This was a time when the workers and peasants of 
the U.S.S.R., under the leadership of the Bolshevik 
Party and on the basis of the decisions of the Fourteenth 
Congress and Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.), 
were continuing their efforts for the socialist industrialisation 
of the country. 
The strengthening of the socialist economy of the 
U.S.S.R. gave rise to a sharp intensification of the 
struggle of the imperialist states against the Soviet 
Union, and of the struggle of the capitalist elements 
against the socialist elements within the country. 
³Something like a united front from Chamberlain 
to Trotsky was being formed² against the Soviet government. 
In his report ³Once More on the Social-Democratic 
Deviation in Our Party,² delivered at the Seventh 
Enlarged Plenum of the E.C.C.I., and his reply to the 
discussion on the report, his speeches at the Fifteenth 
Moscow Gubernia Party Conference and at the meeting 
of workers of the Stalin Railway Workshops, the

PREFACE XII 
article ³Notes on Contemporary Themes² and in other 
works, J. V. Stalin upholds and develops the Marxist- 
Leninist teaching on the Party as the principal directing 
and guiding force of the Soviet state, exposes the ³theories² 
of the leaders of the Trotsky-Zinoviev bloc as inimical 
to the cause of the working class and the Bolshevik 
Party, and denounces the subversive activities of these 
leaders within the C.P.S.U.(B.) and the Comintern. 
In these works, J. V. Stalin deals with questions of 
the theory and practice of socialist industrialisation, 
the building of socialism in the U.S.S.R.; he stresses the 
unity and indivisibility of the national and international 
tasks of the socialist revolution; he defines the Party¹s 
line in the sphere of foreign policy at a time when the 
threat of a new armed attack on the U.S.S.R. had grown, 
and indicates the requirements for strengthening the 
defensive capacity of the Soviet Union. 
In ³The Party¹s Three Fundamental Slogans on the 
Peasant Question,² ³Concerning the Question of a Workers¹ 
and Peasants¹ Government,² and ³The Slogan of 
the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Poor Peasantry 
in the Period of Preparation for October,² 
J. V. Stalin develops Lenin¹s teaching on the alliance 
of the working class and the peasantry, and on the leading 
role of the proletariat in this alliance, and explains 
the class essence of the Soviet state and Soviet Government. 
A considerable part of the ninth volume is taken up 
by works devoted to an analysis of the motive forces 
and prospects of development of the revolutionarydemocratic 
and anti-imperialist movement of the Chinese 
people in 1925-27. They include: ³Questions of the

PREFACE XIII 
Chinese Revolution,² ³Talk With Students of the 
Sun Yat-sen University,² ³The Revolution in China and 
the Tasks of the Comintern,² and others. 
Published for the first time in this volume are 
J. V. Stalin¹s letters to Ksenofontov, Zaitsev, Shinkevich, 
Chugunov, Tsvetkov and Alypov, and Pokrovsky.

ONCE MORE ON THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC 
DEVIATION IN OUR PARTY 
Report Delivered on December 7 
I 
PRELIMINARY REMARKS 
Comrades, permit me to make a few preliminary 
remarks before passing to the substance of the question. 
1. Contradictions of Inner-Party Development 
The first question is that of the struggle within our 
Party, a struggle which did not begin yesterday and 
which has not ceased. 
If we take the history of our Party from the moment 
of its inception in 1903 in the form of the Bolshevik 
group, and follow its successive stages down to our day, 
we can say without exaggeration that the history of our 
Party has been the history of a struggle of contradictions 
within the Party, the history of the overcoming of these 
contradictions and of the gradual strengthening of our 
Party on the basis of overcoming them. Some might think 
that the Russians are excessively pugnacious, 
that they love debating and multiply differences, and 
that it is because of this that the development of their 
Party proceeds through the overcoming of inner Party contradictions. 
That is not true, comrades. It is not a matter 
of pugnacity, but of the existence of disagreements

J. V. S T A L I N 4
based on principle, which arise in the course of the Party¹s 
development, in the course of the class struggle of 
the proletariat. The fact of the matter is that contradictions 
can be overcome only by means of a struggle 
for definite principles, for definite aims of the struggle, 
for definite methods of waging the struggle leading to 
the desired aim. One can, and should, agree to any compromise 
with dissenters in the Party on questions of 
current policy, on questions of a purely practical nature. 
But if these questions are connected with disagreements 
based on principle, no compromise, no ³middle² line 
can save the situation. There can be no ³middle² line 
in questions of principle. Either one set of principles or 
another must be made the basis of the Party¹s work. A 
³middle² line in matters of principle is the ³line² of 
stuffing people¹s heads with rubbish, of glossing over 
disagreements, a ³line² leading to the ideological degeneration 
of the Party, to the ideological death of the 
Party. 
How do the Social-Democratic parties of the West 
exist and develop nowadays? Have they inner-party 
contradictions, disagreements based on principle? Of 
course, they have. Do they disclose these contradictions 
and try to over come them honestly and openly in sight 
of the mass of the party membership? No, of course not. 
It is the practice of the Social-Democrats to cover up 
and conceal these contradictions and disagreements. 
It is the practice of the Social-Democrats to turn their 
conferences and congresses into an empty parade of 
ostensible well-being, assiduously covering up and slurring 
over internal disagreements. But nothing can come 
of this except stuffing people¹s heads with rubbish and

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 5 
the ideological impoverishment of the party. This is one 
of the reasons for the decline of West-European Social- 
Democracy, which was once revolutionary, and is now 
reformist. 
We, however, cannot live and develop in that way, 
comrades. The policy of a ³middle² line in matters of 
principle is not our policy. The policy of a ³middle² line 
in matters of principle is the policy of decaying and 
degenerating parties. Such a policy cannot but lead to 
the conversion of the party into an empty bureaucratic 
apparatus, running idle and divorced from the masses 
of the workers. That path is not our path. 
Our Party¹s whole past confirms the thesis that the 
history of our Party is the history of the overcoming of 
inner-Party contradictions and of the constant strengthening 
of the ranks of our Party on the basis of overcoming 
them. 
Let us take the first period, the Iskra period, or 
the period of the Second Congress of our Party, when 
the disagreements between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks 
first appeared within our Party and when the 
top leadership of our Party in the end split into two 
sections: the Bolshevik section (Lenin), and the Menshevik 
section (Plekhanov, Axelrod, Martov, Zasulich, 
Potresov). Lenin then stood alone. If you only knew 
how much howling and shouting there was then about 
the ³irreplaceables² who had left Lenin! But experience 
of the struggle and the history of the Party showed that 
this divergence was based on principle, that it was an 
essential phase for the birth and development of a really 
revolutionary and really Marxist party. The experience 
of the struggle at that time showed, firstly, that the

J. V. S T A L I N 6
important thing was not quantity, but quality, and, secondly, 
that the important thing was not formal unity, but 
that unity should be based on principle. History showed 
that Lenin was right and the ³irreplaceables² were 
wrong. History showed that if these contradictions 
between Lenin and the ³irreplaceables² had not been 
overcome, we should not today have a genuine revolutionary 
party. 
Let us take the next period, the period of the eve 
of the 1905 Revolution, when the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks 
confronted each other still within one party 
as two camps with two absolutely different platforms, 
when the Bolsheviks stood on the verge of a formal 
splitting of the Party, and when, in order to uphold 
the line of our revolution, they were compelled to convene 
a special congress of their own (the Third Congress). 
To what did the Bolshevik section of the Party owe the 
fact that it then gained the upper hand, that it won the 
sympathy of the majority of the Party? To the fact 
that it did not slur over disagreements based on principle 
and fought to overcome them by isolating the Mensheviks. 
I might refer, further, to the third stage in the development 
of our Party, the period following the defeat 
of the 1905 Revolution, the 1907 period, when a section 
of the Bolsheviks, the so-called ³Otzovists,² headed 
by Bogdanov, forsook Bolshevism. This was a critical 
period in the life of our Party. It was the period when 
a number of Bolsheviks of the old guard deserted Lenin 
and his party. The Mensheviks loudly asserted that the 
Bolsheviks were done for. But Bolshevism was not done 
for, and in the course of about a year and a half experience

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 7 
of the struggle showed that Lenin and his party were right 
in fighting to overcome the contradictions within the 
Bolshevik ranks. These contradictions were overcome 
not by slurring over them, but by bringing them into 
the open and by a struggle, to the benefit and advantage 
of our Party. 
I might refer, further, to the fourth period in the 
history of our Party, the 1911-12 period, when the Bolsheviks 
rebuilt the Party, which had almost been shattered 
by tsarist reaction, and expelled the Liquidators. Here, 
too, as in the previous periods, the Bolsheviks proceeded 
to rebuild and strengthen the Party, not by slurring 
over the disagreements with the Liquidators on matters 
of principle, but by bringing them into the open and 
overcoming them. 
I might point, next, to the fifth stage in the development 
of our Party, the period preceding the October 
Revolution of 1917, when a section of the Bolsheviks, 
headed by well-known leaders of the Bolshevik Party, 
wavered and were against undertaking the October 
uprising, considering it an adventure. We know that 
this contradiction, too, the Bolsheviks overcame not 
by slurring over the disagreements, but by an open 
struggle for the October Revolution. Experience of the 
struggle showed that if we had not overcome those disagreements 
we might have placed the October Revolution 
in a critical position. 
I might point, lastly, to subsequent periods in the development 
of our inner-Party struggle‹the period of the 
Brest Peace, the 1921 period (the trade-union discussion), 
and the other periods, with which you are familiar 
and on which I shall not dilate here. It is well known

J. V. S T A L I N 8
that in all these, as in earlier periods, our Party grew and 
became strong by overcoming internal contradictions. 
What follows from this? 
It follows that the C.P.S.U.(B.) grew and became 
strong by overcoming inner-Party contradictions. 
It follows that the overcoming of inner-Party disagreements 
by means of struggle is a law of development 
of our Party. 
Some may say that this may be a law for the 
C.P.S.U.(B.), but not for other proletarian parties. 
That is not true. This law is a law of development for 
all parties of some size, whether the proletarian Party 
of the U.S.S.R. or the proletarian parties of the West. 
Whereas in a small party in a small country it is possible 
in one way or another to slur over disagreements, 
covering them up by the prestige of one or several persons, 
in the case of a big party in a big country development 
through the overcoming of contradictions is an 
inevitable element of party growth and consolidation. 
So it was in the past. So it is today. 
I should like here to refer to the authority of Engels, 
who, together with Marx, directed the proletarian parties 
of the West for several decades. The matter concerns 
the eighties of the last century, when the Anti-Socialist 
Law2 was in force in Germany, when Marx and Engels 
were in exile in London, and when the Sozialdemokrat,3 
the illegal German Social-Democratic organ published 
abroad, in fact guided the work of German Social- 
Democracy. Bernstein was then a revolutionary Marxist 
(he had not yet managed to go over to the reformists), 
and Engels maintained a lively correspondence with 
him on the most burning problems of German Social

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 9 
Democratic policy. Here is what he wrote to Bernstein 
at that time (1882): 
³It seems that every workers¹ party in a big country can 
develop only by inner struggle, in full conformity with the laws 
of dialectical development in general. The German Party has become 
what it is in a struggle between the Eisenachers and the 
Lassalleans, in which the fight itself played a major role. Unity 
became possible only when the gang of rascals deliberately reared 
by Lassalle to serve him as a tool had played itself out, and even 
so our side showed much too much haste in agreeing to unity. In 
France, the people who, although they have sacrificed the Bakuninist 
theory, continue to employ Bakuninist methods of struggle and 
at the same time want to sacrifice the class character of the movement 
to their own special ends, must also first play themselves 
out before unity can again become possible. To preach unity under 
such circumstances would be sheer folly. Moral preaching is of 
no avail against infantile diseases, which under present circumstances 
have to be gone through² (see Marx-Engels Archives, 
Book I, pp. 324-254). 
For, Engels says in another place (1885): 
³In the long run the contradictions are never slurred over, 
but always fought out² (ibid., p. 371). 
It is to this, above all, that we must attribute the 
existence of contradictions within our Party and the 
development of our Party by overcoming these contradictions 
through struggle. 
2. Sources of Contradictions Within the Party 
Where do these contradictions and disagreements 
stem from, what is their source? 
I think that the source of the contradictions within 
the proletarian parties lies in two circumstances.

J. V. S T A L I N 10 
What are these circumstances? 
They are, firstly, the pressure exerted by the bourgeoisie 
and bourgeois ideology on the proletariat and 
its party in the conditions of the class struggle‹a pressure 
to which the least stable strata of the proletariat, 
and, hence, the least stable strata of the proletarian 
party, not infrequently succumb. It must not be thought 
that the proletariat is completely isolated from society, 
that it stands outside society. The proletariat is a part 
of society, connected with its diverse strata by numerous 
threads. But the party is a part of the proletariat. 
Hence the Party cannot be exempt from connections 
with, and from the influence of, the diverse sections 
of bourgeois society. The pressure of the bourgeoisie 
and its ideology on the proletariat and its party finds 
expression in the fact that bourgeois ideas, manners, 
customs and sentiments not infrequently penetrate 
the proletariat and its party through definite strata 
of the proletariat that are in one way or another 
connected with bourgeois society. 
They are, secondly, the heterogeneity of the working 
class, the existence of different strata within the working 
class. I think that the proletariat, as a class, can 
be divided into three strata. 
One stratum is the main mass of the proletariat, 
its core, its permanent part, the mass of ³pure-blooded² 
proletarians, who have long broken off connection with 
the capitalist class. This stratum of the proletariat is 
the most reliable bulwark of Marxism. 
The second stratum consists of newcomers from nonproletarian 
classes‹from the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie 
or the intelligentsia. These are former members

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 11 
of other classes who have only recently merged with 
the proletariat and have brought with them into 
the working class their customs, their habits, their 
waverings and their vacillations. This stratum constitutes 
the most favourable soil for all sorts of anarchist, 
semi-anarchist and ³ultra-Left² groups. 
The third stratum, lastly, consists of the labour 
aristocracy, the upper stratum of the working class, 
the most well-to-do portion of the proletariat, with its 
propensity for compromise with the bourgeoisie, its 
predominant inclination to adapt itself to the powers 
that be, and its anxiety to ³get on in life.² This stratum 
constitutes the most favourable soil for outright reformists 
and opportunists. 
Notwithstanding their superficial difference, these 
last two strata of the working class constitute a more 
or less common nutritive medium for opportunism in 
general‹open opportunism, when the sentiments of 
the labour aristocracy gain the upper hand, and opportunism 
camouflaged with ³Left² phrases, when the sentiments 
of the semi-middle-class strata of the working 
class which have not yet completely broken with the 
petty-bourgeois environment gain the upper hand. The 
fact that ³ultra-Left² sentiments very often coincide with 
the sentiments of open opportunism is not at all surprising. 
Lenin said time and again that the ³ultra- 
Left² opposition is the reverse side of the Right-wing, 
Menshevik, openly opportunist opposition. And that 
is quite true. If the ³ultra-Lefts² stand for revolution 
only because they expect the victory of the revolution 
the very next day, then obviously they must fall into 
despair and be disillusioned in the revolution if the

J. V. S T A L I N 12 
revolution is delayed, if the revolution is not victorious 
the very next day. 
Naturally, with every turn in the development of 
the class struggle, with every sharpening of the struggle 
and intensification of difficulties, the differences in 
the views, customs and sentiments of the various strata 
of the proletariat must inevitably make themselves 
felt in the shape of definite disagreements within the 
party, and the pressure of the bourgeoisie and its ideology 
must inevitably accentuate these disagreements 
by providing them with an outlet in the form of a struggle 
within the proletarian party. 
Such are the sources of inner-Party contradictions 
and disagreements. 
Can these contradictions and disagreements be 
avoided? No, they cannot. To think that these contradictions 
can be avoided is self-deception. Engels was right 
when he said that in the long run it is impossible to 
slur over contradictions within the party, that they 
must be fought out. 
This does not mean that the party must be turned 
into a debating society. On the contrary, the proletarian 
party is, and must remain, a militant organisation 
of the proletariat. All I want to say is that one cannot 
brush aside and shut one¹s eyes to disagreements within 
the party if they are disagreements over matters of 
principle. All I want to say is that only by fighting for 
the Marxist line based on principle can a proletarian 
party be protected from the pressure and influence of 
the bourgeoisie. All I want to say is that only by overcoming 
inner-Party contradictions can we succeed in 
making the Party sound and strong.

II 
SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE OPPOSITION 
IN THE C.P.S.U.(B.) 
Permit me now to pass from the preliminary remarks 
to the question of the opposition in the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
First of all, I should like to mention certain specific 
features of our inner-Party opposition. I am referring 
to its external features, those which strike the eye, 
and shall leave aside for the present the substance of 
the disagreements. I think these specific features may 
be reduced to three principal ones. There is, firstly, the 
fact that the opposition in the C.P.S.U.(B.) is a combined 
opposition and not ³simply² some kind of opposition. 
There is, secondly, the fact that the opposition tries 
to camouflage its opportunism with ³Left² phrases, 
making a parade of ³revolutionary² slogans. There is, 
thirdly, the fact that the opposition, because of its 
amorphousness as regards principles, every now and again 
complains that i t has been misunderstood‹that in 
point of fact the opposition leaders constitute a faction 
of ³the misunderstood.² (Laughter.) 
Let us begin with the first specific feature. How 
are we to explain the fact that our opposition comes 
forward as a combined opposition, as a bloc of all the 
various trends previously condemned by the Party, 
and, moreover, that it comes forward not ³simply,² 
but with Trotskyism at its head? 
It is to be explained by the following circumstances: 
Firstly, by the fact that all the trends united in 
the bloc-the Trotskyists, the ³New Opposition,² the 
remnants of ³Democratic Centralism,²5 the remnants

J. V. S T A L I N 14 
of the ³Workers¹ Opposition²6 ‹are all more or less 
opportunist trends, which have either been fighting 
Leninism since their inception or have begun to fight 
it latterly. It stands to reason that this common feature 
could not but facilitate their uniting into a bloc for 
the purpose of fighting the Party. 
Secondly, by the fact that the present period is 
a crucial one, and that this crucial period has again faced 
us point blank with the basic questions of our revolution; 
and since all these trends differed, and continue 
to differ, with our Party over various questions of the 
revolution, it is natural that the character of the present 
period, which sums up and strikes the balance of all 
our disagreements, should impel all these trends into 
one bloc, a bloc opposed to the basic line of our Party. 
It stands to reason that this circumstance could not 
but facilitate the uniting of the diverse opposition 
trends into one common camp. 
Thirdly, by the fact that the mighty strength and 
solidarity of our Party, on the one hand, and the weakness 
of all the opposition trends without exception and 
their divorce from the masses, on the other hand, could 
not but render the disunited struggle of these trends 
against the Party manifestly hopeless, in view of which 
the opposition trends inevitably had to take the course of 
uniting their forces, so as to compensate for the weakness 
of the individual groups by combining them, and thus 
increase the opposition¹s chances, if only in appearance. 
Well, and how are we to explain the fact that the 
opposition bloc is headed precisely by Trotskyism? 
Firstly, by the fact that Trotskyism represents the 
most consummate opportunist trend of all the existing

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 15 
opposition trends in our Party (the Fifth Congress of 
the Comintern was right in characterising Trotskyism 
as a petty-bourgeois deviation7). 
Secondly, by the fact that not a single other opposition 
trend in our Party is able to camouflage its opportunism 
with ³Left² and r-r-r-revolutionary phrases so 
cunningly and skilfully as Trotskyism. (Laughter.) 
This is not the first occasion in the history of our 
Party that Trotskyism has come forward at the head of 
the opposition trends against our Party. I should like 
to refer to the well known precedent in the history of 
our Party dating back to 1910-14, when a bloc of anti- 
Party opposition trends, headed by Trotsky, was formed 
in the shape of the so-called August Bloc. I should like 
to refer to this precedent, because that bloc represents 
as it were the prototype of the present opposition bloc. 
At that time Trotsky united against the Party the Liquidators 
(Potresov, Martov and others), the Otzovists 
(³Vperyodists²) and his own group. Now he has attempted 
to unite in an opposition bloc the ³Workers¹ 
Opposition,² the ³New Opposition² and his own group. 
We know that Lenin fought the August Bloc for 
three years. Here is what Lenin wrote of the August 
Bloc on the eve of its formation: 
³We therefore declare in the name of the Party as a whole 
that Trotsky is conducting an anti-Party policy‹that he is breaking 
Party law and embarking on the path of adventurism and a 
split. . . . Trotsky keeps silent about this undeniable truth, because 
the real aims of his policy cannot stand the truth. But the 
real aims are becoming ever clearer and more obvious even to 
the least far-sighted Party members. These real aims are an anti- 
Party bloc of the Potresovs and Vperyodists, which bloc Trotsky

J. V. S T A L I N 16 
is supporting and organising. . . . This bloc, of course, will support 
Trotsky¹s Œfund,¹ and the anti-Party conference he is convening, 
because both the Potresovs and the Vperyodists are getting 
here what they want: freedom for their factions and their consecration, 
a cover for their activity, and lawyer-like advocacy of it 
in the eyes of the workers. 
³Well then, precisely from the standpoint of Œfundamental 
principles,¹ we cannot but regard this bloc as adventurism in 
the most precise meaning of the term. To say that he sees in 
Potresov and the Otzovists genuine Marxists, real champions of the 
principles of Social-Democracy, Trotsky does not dare. The essence 
of the position of an adventurer is that he has permanently 
to be evasive. . . . Trotsky¹s bloc with Potresov and the Vperyodists 
is adventurism precisely from the standpoint of Œfundamental 
principles.¹ That is no less true from the standpoint of the Party¹s 
political tasks. . . . The experience of the year since the plenum 
has shown in practice that it is precisely the Potresov groups and 
the Vperyod faction that embody this bourgeois influence on the proletariat. 
. . . Thirdly and lastly, Trotsky¹s policy is adventurism 
in the organisational sense, for, as we have already pointed out, 
it tears down Party legality and, by organising a conference in the name 
of one group abroad (or in the name of a bloc of two anti-Party 
factions-the Golosists and Vperyodists), it is directly making 
for a split² (see Vol. XV, pp. 65, 67-70).* 
That is what Lenin said about the first bloc of anti- 
Party trends headed by Trotsky. 
The same must be said in substance, but still more 
emphatically, of the present bloc of anti-Party trends, 
also headed by Trotsky. 
These are the reasons why our opposition now comes 
forward in the shape of a united opposition, and not 
³simply,² but with Trotskyism at its head.

elsewhere are to the third edition of the Works.‹Tr.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 17 
That is how matters stand as regards the first specific 
feature of the opposition. 
Let us pass to the second specific feature. I have 
already said that the second specific feature of the opposition 
is its strenuous effort to camouflage its opportunist 
deeds with ³Left,² ³revolutionary² phrases. I do 
not consider it possible to dwell here on the facts that 
show the constant divergence between ³revolutionary² 
words and opportunist deeds in the practice of our opposition. 
It is sufficient to examine, for example, the theses 
on the opposition adopted by the Fifteenth Conference 
of the C.P.S.U.(B.)8 to understand how this camouflage 
works. I should like merely to quote a few instances from 
the history of our Party which indicate that all the opposition 
trends in our Party in the period since the seizure 
of power have endeavoured to camouflage their non-revolutionary 
deeds with ³revolutionary² phrases, invariably 
criticising the Party and its policy from the ³Left.² 
Let us take, for example, the ³Left² Communists 
who came out against the Party in the period of the 
Brest Peace (1918). We know that they criticised the 
Party from the ³Left,² attacking the Brest Peace and 
characterising the Party¹s policy as opportunist, unproletarian 
and one of compromise with the imperialists. 
But it proved in practice that, in attacking the Brest 
Peace, the ³Left² Communists were preventing the Party 
from securing a ³respite² in which to organise and consolidate 
Soviet power, that they were helping the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who were then 
opposed to the Brest Peace, and were facilitating the 
efforts of imperialism, which was endeavouring to crush 
the Soviet power at its very inception.

Let us take the ³Workers¹ Opposition² (1921). We 
know that it also criticised the Party from the ³Left,² 
³fulminating² against the policy of NEP and ³pulverising² 
to ³dust and ashes² Lenin¹s thesis that the 
restoration of industry must begin with the development 
of agriculture, which provides the raw materials 
and food that are prerequisites for industry, ³pulverising² 
this thesis of Lenin¹s on the grounds that it 
ignored the interests of the proletariat and was a peasant 
deviation. But it proved in practice that, had it not 
been for the NEP policy, had it not been for the development 
of agriculture, which provides the raw materials 
and food that are prerequisites for industry, we 
should have had no industry at all, and the proletariat 
would have remained declassed. Moreover, we 
know in which direction the ³Workers¹ Opposition² 
began to develop after this‹to the Right or to the 
Left. 
Let us, lastly, take Trotskyism, which for several 
years now has been criticising our Party from the ³Left² 
and which at the same time, as the Fifth Congress of 
the Comintern correctly put it, is a petty-bourgeois 
deviation. What can there be in common between a 
petty-bourgeois deviation and real revolutionary spirit? 
Is it not obvious that ³revolutionary² phrases are here 
merely a camouflage for a petty-bourgeois deviation? 
There is no need to mention the ³New Opposition,² 
whose ³Left² cries are designed to conceal the fact 
that it is a captive of Trotskyism. 
What do all these facts show? 
That ³Left² camouflage of opportunist actions 
has been one of the most characteristic features of all

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 19 
the various opposition trends in our Party during the 
period since the seizure of power. 
What is the explanation of this phenomenon? 
The explanation lies in the revolutionary spirit 
of the proletariat of the U.S.S.R., the profound revolutionary 
traditions that are deep-seated in our proletariat. 
The explanation lies in the downright hatred 
in which anti-revolutionary and opportunist elements 
are held by the workers of the U.S.S.R. The explanation 
lies in the fact that our workers will simply not listen 
to an open opportunist, and that therefore the ³revolutionary² 
camouflage is a bait designed to attract, if 
only by its outward appearance, the attention of the 
workers and to inspire them with confidence in the opposition. 
Our workers, for instance, cannot understand 
why the British workers to this day have not thought 
of drowning such traitors as Thomas, of throwing them 
down a well. (Laughter.) Anyone who knows our workers 
will easily realise that individuals and opportunists 
like Thomas would simply not be tolerated by 
the Soviet workers. Yet we know that not only are the 
British workers not preparing to drown Messieurs the 
Thomases, but they even re-elect them to the General 
Council and re-elect them not just simply, but with 
acclamation. Obviously, such workers do not need a 
revolutionary camouflage for opportunism, since they 
are not averse to accepting opportunists into their 
midst as it is. 
And what is the explanation of this? The explanation 
lies in the fact that the British workers have no 
revolutionary traditions. These revolutionary traditions 
are now coming into being. They are coming into

J. V. S T A L I N 20 
being and developing, and there is no reason to doubt 
that the British workers are being tempered in revolutionary 
battle. But as long as these are lacking, 
the difference between the British and the Soviet 
workers remains. This, in fact, explains why it is risky 
for the opportunists in our Party to approach the 
workers of the U.S.S.R. without some ³revolutionary² 
camouflage. 
There you have the reasons for the ³revolutionary² 
camouflage of the opposition bloc. 
Finally, as regards the third specific feature of 
the opposition. I have already said that it consists in 
the amorphousness as regards principle of the opposition 
bloc, in its unprincipledness, in its amoebic character, 
and in the consequent continual complaints of the opposition 
leaders that they have been ³misunderstood,² 
³misrepresented,² fathered with what they ³did not 
say² and so on. They are truly a faction of ³the misunderstood.² 
The history of proletarian parties tells us 
that this feature (³they have misunderstood us!²) is the 
most common and wide-spread feature of opportunism in 
general. You must know, comrades, that exactly the 
same thing ³happened² with the well-known opportunists 
Bernstein, Vollmar, Auer and others in the ranks of German 
Social-Democracy at the end of the 1890¹s and the 
beginning of the 1900¹s, when German Social-Democracy 
was revolutionary, and when these arrant opportunists 
complained for many years that they were ³misunderstood² 
and ³misrepresented.² We know that the German 
revolutionary Social-Democrats at that time called the 
Bernstein faction the faction of ³the misunderstood.² 
Thus it cannot be regarded as an accident that the oppo

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 21 
sition bloc has to be assigned to the category of ³misunderstood² 
factions. 
Such are the chief specific features of the opposition 
bloc. 
III 
THE DISAGREEMENTS IN THE C.P.S.U.(B.) 
Let us pass to the substance of the disagreements. 
I think that our disagreements could be reduced to 
a few basic questions. I shall not deal with these questions 
in detail, because time is short and my report 
is long enough as it is. There is all the more reason for 
not doing so, because you have material on the questions 
of the C.P.S.U.(B.), material which suffers, it is true, 
from certain errors of translation, but which on the 
whole gives a correct idea of the disagreements in our 
Party. 
1. Questions of Socialist Construction 
First question. The first question is that of the possibility 
of the victory of socialism in one country, the 
possibility of victoriously building socialism. It is not 
a matter, of course, of Montenegro or even Bulgaria, but 
of our country, the U.S.S.R. It is a matter of a country 
where imperialism existed and was developing, where there 
is a certain minimum of large-scale industry and a certain 
minimum of proletariat, and where there is a party which 
leads the proletariat. And so, is the victory of socialism 
possible in the U.S.S.R., can socialism be built in the 
U.S.S.R. on the basis of the internal forces of our country

J. V. S T A L I N 22 
and on the basis of the potentialities at the disposal 
of the proletariat of the U.S.S.R.? 
But what does building socialism mean, if this formula 
is translated into concrete class language? Building 
socialism in the U.S.S.R. means overcoming our, 
Soviet, bourgeoisie by our own efforts in the course 
of a struggle. Hence the question amounts to this: is 
the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. capable of overcoming 
its own, Soviet bourgeoisie? Consequently, when it is 
asked whether socialism can be built in the U.S.S.R., 
what is meant is this: is the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
by its own efforts capable of overcoming the bourgeoisie 
of the U.S.S.R.? That, and that alone, is how 
the question stands as regards solving the problem of 
building socialism in our country. 
The Party answers this question in the affirmative, 
because it holds that the proletariat of the U.S.S.R., 
the proletarian dictatorship in the U.S.S.R., by its own 
efforts is capable of overcoming the bourgeoisie of the 
U.S.S.R. 
If this were incorrect, if the Party had no justification 
for asserting that the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
is capable of building a socialist society, despite the 
relative technical backwardness of our country, then 
the Party would have no justification for remaining in 
power any longer, it would have to surrender power in 
one way or another and to pass to the position of anopposition 
party. 
For, one thing or the other: 
either we can engage in building socialism and, 
in the final analysis, build it completely, overcoming 
our ³national² bourgeoisie-in which case i t i s the

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 23 
duty of the Party to remain in power and direct the 
building of socialism in our country for the sake of the 
victory of socialism throughout the world; 
or we are not in a position to overcome our bourgeoisie 
by our own efforts‹in which case, in view of 
the absence of immediate support from abroad, from 
a victorious revolution in other countries, we must 
honestly and frankly retire from power and steer a course 
for organising another revolution in the U.S.S.R. 
in the future. 
Has a party the right to deceive its class, in this 
case the working class? No, it has not. Such a party 
would deserve to be hanged, drawn and quartered. But 
just because our Party has no right to deceive the working 
class, it would have to say frankly that lack of confidence 
in the possibility of completely building socialism 
in our country would lead to our Party retiring 
from power and passing from the position of a ruling 
party to that of an opposition party. 
We have won the dictatorship of the proletariat 
and have thereby created the political basis for the 
advance to socialism. Can we by our own efforts create 
the economic basis of socialism, the new economic foundation 
necessary for the building of socialism? What is 
the economic essence and economic basis of socialism? 
Is it the establishment of a ³paradise² on earth and 
universal abundance? No, that is the philistine, pettybourgeois 
idea of the economic essence of socialism. 
To create the economic basis of socialism means welding 
agriculture and socialist industry into one integral 
economy, subordinating agriculture to the leadership 
of socialist industry, regulating relations between town

J. V. S T A L I N 24 
and country on the basis of an exchange of the products 
of agriculture and industry, closing and eliminating 
all the channels which facilitate the birth of classes 
and, above all, of capital, and, in the long run, establishing 
such conditions of production and distribution as 
will lead directly and immediately to the abolition of 
classes. 
Here is what Comrade Lenin said on this score in 
the period when we introduced NEP, and when the 
question of laying a socialist foundation for the national 
economy confronted the Party in all its magnitude: 
³Replacement of the surplus-appropriation system by a 
tax, its significance in principle: transition from ŒWar¹ Communism 
to a correct socialist foundation. Neither the surplus-appropriation 
system, nor a tax, but the exchange of the products of 
large-scale (Œsocialised¹) industry for peasant products-such is 
the economic essence of socialism, its basis² (see Vol. XXVI, 
pp. 311-12). 
That is how Lenin understood the question of creating 
the economic basis of socialism. 
But in order to weld agriculture with socialised 
industry, it is necessary, in the first place, to have an 
extensive network of bodies for the distribution of products, 
an extensive network of co-operative bodies, both 
of consumer co-operatives and of agricultural, producer 
co-operatives. That was precisely what Lenin had in 
mind when he said in his pamphlet On Co-operation: 
³Co-operation, under our conditions, very often entirely 
coincides with socialism² (see Vol. XXVII, p. 396). 
And so, can the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. by 
its own efforts build the economic basis of socialism, in

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 25 
the conditions of the capitalist encirclement of our 
country? 
The Party replies to this question in the affirmative 
(see resolution of the Fourteenth Conference of the 
R.C.P.(B.)9). Lenin replies to this question in the affirmative 
(see, for instance, his pamphlet On Co-operation) 
. All the experience of our constructive work 
furnishes an affirmative answer to this question, because 
the share of the socialist sector in our economy is 
growing from year to year at the expense of that of private 
capital, both in the sphere of production and in the 
sphere of distribution, while the role of private capital 
as compared with that of the socialist elements in our 
economy is declining from year to year. 
Wel l , and how does the opposition reply to this 
question? 
It replies to this question in the negative. 
It follows that the victory of socialism in our country 
is possible, that the possibility of building the economic 
basis of socialism may be regarded as assured. 
Does this mean that such a victory can be termed 
a full victory, a final victory of socialism, one that would 
guarantee the country that is building socialism against 
all danger from abroad, against the danger of imperialist 
intervention and the consequent danger of restoration? 
No, it does not. While the question of completely 
building socialism in the U.S.S.R. is one of overcoming 
our own, ³national,² bourgeoisie, the question of the 
final victory of socialism is one of overcoming the world 
bourgeoisie. The Party says that the proletariat of one 
country is not in a position to overpower the world 
bourgeoisie by its own efforts. The Party says that

J. V. S T A L I N 26 
for the final victory of socialism in one country it is 
necessary to overcome, or at least to neutralise, the 
world bourgeoisie. The Party says that such a task 
is within the power only of the proletariat of several 
countries. Consequently, the final victory of socialism 
in a particular country signifies the victory of 
the proletarian revolution in, at least, several countries. 
This question does not give rise to any special disagreement 
in our Party, and therefore I shall not dwell 
on it, but would refer those who are interested to the 
materials of the Central Committee of our Party which 
were distributed the other day to the members of the 
Enlarged Plenum of the E.C.C.I. 
2. Factors of the ³Respite² 
Second question. The second question concerns problems 
of the conditions of the present international 
position of the U.S.S.R., the conditions of that period 
of ³respite² during which the work of building socialism 
in our country began and developed. We can and 
must build socialism in the U.S.S.R. But in order to 
build socialism, we must first exist. There must be a 
³respite² from war, there must be no attempts at intervention, 
there must have been won a certain minimum 
of international conditions which are necessary in order 
that we may exist and build socialism. 
On what, it may be asked, does the present international 
position of the Republic of Soviets rest, what 
determines the present ³peaceful² period of development 
of our country in its relation to the capitalist coun

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 27 
tries, what is the basis of that ³respite,² or of that period 
of ³respite,² which has been won, which renders 
immediate attempts at serious intervention on the part 
of the capitalist world impossible, and which creates 
the necessary external conditions for the building of 
socialism in our country, seeing that it has been proved 
that the danger of intervention exists and will continue 
to exist, and that this danger can be eliminated only 
as a result of the victory of the proletarian revolution 
in a number of countries? 
The present period of ³respite² is based on at least 
four fundamental facts. 
Firstly, on the contradictions within the imperialist 
camp, which are not becoming weaker and which render 
a plot against the Republic of Soviets difficult. 
Secondly, on the contradictions between imperialism 
and the colonial countries, on the growth of the 
liberation movement in the colonies and dependent 
countries. 
Thirdly, on the growth of the revolutionary movement 
in the capitalist countries and the growing sympathy 
of the proletarians of all countries for the Republic 
of Soviets. The proletarians of the capitalist 
countries are not yet able to support the proletarians 
of the U.S.S.R. with an outright revolution against 
their own capitalists. But the capitalists of the imperialist 
states are already unable to march ³their² workers 
against the proletariat of the U.S.S.R., because 
the sympathy of the proletarians of all countries for 
the Republic of Soviets is growing, and is bound to 
grow from day to day. And to go to war nowadays without 
the workers is impossible.

J. V. S T A L I N 28 
Fourthly, on the strength and might of the proletariat 
of the U.S.S.R., on its achievements in socialist 
construction, and on the strength of organisation of its 
Red Army. 
The combination of these and similar conditions 
gives rise to that period of ³respite² which is the characteristic 
feature of the present international position 
in the Republic of Soviets. 
3. The Unity and Inseparability 
of the ³National² and International Tasks 
of the Revolution 
Third question. The third question concerns problems 
of the ³national² and international tasks of the proletarian 
revolution in a particular country. The Party 
holds that the ³national² and international tasks of 
the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. merge into the one general 
task of emancipating the proletarians of all countries 
from capitalism, that the interests of the building 
of socialism in our country wholly and completely 
merge with the interests of the revolutionary movement 
of all countries into the one general interest of the victory 
of the socialist revolution in all countries. 
What would happen if the proletarians of all countries 
did not sympathise with and support the Republic 
of Soviets? There would be intervention and the Republic 
of Soviets would be smashed. 
What would happen if capital succeeded in smashing 
the Republic of Soviets? There would set in an era of 
the blackest reaction in all the capitalist and colonial

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 29 
countries, the working class and the oppressed peoples 
would be seized by the throat, the positions of international 
communism would be lost. 
What will happen if the sympathy and support that 
the Republic of Soviets enjoys among the proletarians 
of all countries grows and intensifies? It will radically 
facilitate the building of socialism in the U.S.S.R. 
What will happen if the achievements of socialist 
construction in the U.S.S.R. continue to grow? It will 
radically improve the revolutionary position of the 
proletarians of all countries in their struggle against 
capital, will undermine the position of international 
capital in i t s struggle against the proletariat, and 
will greatly heighten the chances of the world proletariat. 
But it follows from this that the interests and tasks 
of the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. are interwoven and 
inseparably connected with the interests and tasks of 
the revolutionary movement in all countries, and, conversely, 
that the tasks of the revolutionary proletarians 
of all countries are inseparably connected with the tasks 
and achievements of the proletarians of the U.S.S.R. 
in the field of socialist construction. 
Hence to counterpose the ³national² tasks of the 
proletarians of a particular country to the international 
tasks is to commit a profound political error. 
Hence anyone who depicts the zeal and fervour 
displayed by the proletarians of the U.S.S.R. in the 
struggle on the front of socialist construction as a sign 
of ³national isolation² or ³national narrow-mindedness,² 
as our oppositionists sometimes do, has gone out of his 
mind or fallen into second childhood.

J. V. S T A L I N 30 
Hence affirmation of the unity and inseparability 
of the interests and tasks of the proletarians of one 
country and the interests and tasks of the proletarians 
of all countries is the surest way to the victory of the 
revolutionary movement of the proletarians of all countries. 
Precisely for this reason, the victory of the proletarian 
revolution in one country is not an end in itself, 
but a means and an aid for the development and victory 
of the revolution in all countries. 
Hence building socialism in the U.S.S.R. means 
furthering the common cause of the proletarians of all 
countries, it means forging the victory over capital not 
only in the U.S.S.R., but in all the capitalist countries, 
for the revolution in the U.S.S.R. is part of the world 
revolution‹its beginning and the base for its development. 
4. Concerning the History of the Question 
of Building Socialism 
Fourth question. The fourth question concerns the 
history of the question under discussion. The opposition 
asserts that the question of the building of socialism 
in one country was first raised in our Party in 1925. 
At all events, Trotsky bluntly declared at the Fifteenth 
Conference: ³Why is theoretical recognition of the 
building of socialism in one country demanded? Where 
does this perspective come from? How is it that nobody 
raised this question before 1925?² 
It follows, then, that before 1925 this question was 
not raised in our Party. It follows that this question

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 31 
was raised in the Party only by Stalin and Bukharin, 
and that it was in 1925 that they raised it. 
Is that true? No, it is not. 
I affirm that the question of the building of a socialist 
economy in one country was first raised in the 
Party by Lenin as early as 1915. I affirm that Lenin 
was opposed at that time by none other than Trotsky. 
I affirm that since then, that is, since 1915, the question 
of the building of a socialist economy in one country 
was repeatedly discussed in our press and in our 
Party. 
Let us turn to the facts. 
a) 1915. Lenin¹s article on ³The United States of 
Europe Slogan² in the Central Organ of the Bolsheviks 
(Sotsial-Demokrat10). Here is what Lenin says in that 
article: 
³As a separate slogan, however, the slogan of a United States 
of the World would hardly be a correct one, firstly, because it 
merges with socialism; secondly, because it may give rise to a wrong 
interpretation in the sense of the impossibility of the victory of 
socialism in a single country and about the relation of such a 
country to the rest. 
³Uneven economic and political development is an absolute 
law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible first in 
several or even in one capitalist country taken separately. The victorious 
proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists 
and having organised its own socialist production,* would stand up against 
the rest of the world, the capitalist world, attracting to its cause 
the oppressed classes of other countries, raising revolts in those 
countries against the capitalists, and in the event of necessity 
coming out even with armed force against the exploiting classes 
and their states.² . . . For ³the free union of nations in

socialism is impossible without a more or less prolonged and stubborn 
struggle of the socialist republics against the backward 
states² (see Vol. XVIII, pp. 232-33). 
And here is Trotsky¹s rejoinder, made in the same 
year, 1915, in Nashe Slovo,11 which Trotsky directed: 
³¹Uneven economic and political development is an absolute 
law of capitalism.¹ From this the Sotsial-Demokrat (the central 
organ of the Bolsheviks in 1915, where Lenin¹s article in question 
was published.‹J. St.) draws the conclusion that the victory 
of socialism is possible in one country, and that therefore there is 
no reason to make the dictatorship of the proletariat in each separate 
country contingent upon the establishment of a United 
States of Europe. . . . That no country in its struggle must Œwait¹ 
for others, is an elementary thought which it is useful and necessary 
to reiterate in order that the idea of concurrent international 
action may not be replaced by the idea of temporising international 
inaction. Without waiting for the others, we begin and continue the 
struggle nationally, in the full confidence that our initiative will 
give an impetus to the struggle other countries; but i f this 
should not occur, it would be hopeless to think‹as historical experience 
and theoretical considerations testify‹that, for example, 
a revolutionary Russia could hold out in the face of a conservative 
Europe, or that a socialist Germany could exist in isolation 
in a capitalist world. To accept the perspective of a social 
revolution within national bounds is to fall a prey to that very 
national narrow-mindedness which constitutes the essence of socialpatriotism²* 
(Trotsky, The Year 1917, Vol. III, Part I, pp. 89-90). 
You see that the question of ³organising socialist 
production² was raised by Lenin as far back as 1915, 
on the eve of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in 
Russia, at the time of the imperialist war, when the 
question of the growing over of the bourgeois-democratic 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 33 
revolution into a socialist revolution was on the order 
of the day. 
You see that at that time Comrade Lenin was controverted 
by none other than Trotsky, who obviously 
knew that Lenin in his article was speaking of the ³victory 
of socialism² and of the possibility of ³organising 
socialist production in one country.² 
You see that the charge of ³national narrow-mindedness² 
was raised for the first time by Trotsky already in 
1915, and that this charge was levelled not against 
Stalin or Bukharin, but against Lenin. 
Now it is Zinoviev who every now and again puts 
forward the ludicrous charge of ³national narrow-mindedness.² 
But he apparently does not realise that in so 
doing he is repeating and reviving Trotsky¹s thesis, 
directed against Lenin and his Party. 
b) 1919. Lenin¹s article ³Economics and Politics 
in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.² Here 
is what Lenin says in that article: 
³In spite of the lies and slanders of the bourgeoisie of all 
countries and of their open or masked henchmen the ŒSocialists¹ 
of the Second International), one thing remains beyond dispute, 
viz., that from the point of view of the basic economic problem of 
the dictatorship of the proletariat, the victory of communism over 
capitalism in our country is assured. Throughout the world the 
bourgeoisie is raging and fuming against Bolshevism and is organising 
military expeditions, plots, etc., against the Bolsheviks, 
just because it fully realises that our success in reconstructing the 
social economy is inevitable, provided we are not crushed by military 
force. And its attempts to crush us in this way are not succeeding²* 
(see Vol. XXIV, p. 510) 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 34 
You see that in this article Lenin speaks of the 
³economic problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat,² 
of ³reconstructing the social economy² with a 
view to the ³victory of communism.² And what does 
the ³economic problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat² 
and ³reconstructing the social economy² mean 
under the dictatorship of the proletariat? I t means 
nothing else than the building of socialism in one country, 
our country. 
c) 1921. Lenin¹s pamphlet, The Tax in Kind.12 
The well known proposition that we can and must lay 
³a socialist foundation for our economy² (see The Tax 
in Kind). 
d) 1922. Lenin¹s speech in the Moscow Soviet, where 
he says that ³we have dragged socialism into everyday 
life,² and that ³NEP Russia will become socialist Russia² 
(see Vol. XXVII, p. 366). Trotsky¹s rejoinder to 
this in his ³Postscript² to the Peace Programme in 1922, 
without any direct indication that he is polemising 
against Lenin. Here is what Trotsky says in the ³Postscript²: 
³The assertion reiterated several times in the Peace Programme 
that a proletarian revolution cannot culminate victoriously 
within national bounds may perhaps seem to some readers 
to have been refuted by the nearly five years¹ experience of our 
Soviet Republic. But such a conclusion would be unwarranted. 
The fact that the workers¹ state has held out against the whole 
world in one country, and a backward country a t that, testifies 
to the colossal might of the proletariat, which in other, more 
advanced, more civilised countries will be truly capable of performing 
miracles. But while we have held our ground as a state 
politically and militarily, we have not arrived, or even begun 
to arrive, at the creation of a socialist society. The struggle for

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 35 
survival as a revolutionary state has resulted in this period in 
an extreme decline of productive forces; yet socialism is conceivable 
only on the basis of their growth and development. The trade 
negotiations with bourgeois countries, the concessions the Genoa 
Conference and the like constitute all too graphic evidence of 
the impossibility of isolated building of socialism within the framework 
of national states. . . . Real progress of a socialist economy in 
Russia will become possible only after the victory of the proletariat 
in the major European countries²* (Trotsky, The Year 1917, 
Vol. III, Part I, pp. 92-93). 
Who is Trotsky controverting when he speaks here 
of ³the impossibility of isolated building of socialism 
within the framework of national states²? Not, of course, 
Stalin or Bukharin. Trotsky is here controverting Comrade 
Lenin, and controverting him on the basic question 
and no other‹the possibility of ³socialist construction 
within the framework of national states.² 
e) 1923. Lenin¹s pamphlet On Co-operation, which 
was his political testament. Here is what Lenin wrote 
in this pamphlet: 
³As a matter of fact, state power over all large-scale 
means of production, state power in the hands of the proletariat, 
the alliance of this proletariat with the many millions 
of small and very small peasants, the assured leadership of the 
peasantry by the proletariat, etc.‹is not this all that is necessary 
for building a complete socialist society from the co-operatives, 
from the co-operatives alone, which we formerly looked down 
upon as huckstering and which from a certain aspect we have the 
right to look down upon as such now, under NEP? Is this not 
all that is necessary for building a complete socialist society? This 
is not yet the building of socialist society, but it is all that is 
necessary and sufficient for this building²* (see Vol. XXVII, p. 392). 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 36 
I t could hardly be put more clearly, one would 
think. 
From what Trotsky says it follows that ³socialist 
construction within the framework of national states² 
is impossible. Lenin, however, affirms that we, that 
is, the proletariat of the U.S.S.R., have now, in the 
period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, ³all that 
is necessary and sufficient² ³for building a complete 
socialist society.² The antithesis of views is 
absolute. 
Such are the facts. 
You thus see that the question of the building of 
socialism in one country was raised in our Party as early 
as 1915, that it was raised by Lenin himself, and that 
he was controverted on this issue by none other than 
Trotsky, who accused Lenin of ³national narrow-mindedness.² 
You see that since then and down to Comrade 
Lenin¹s death this question was not removed from the 
order of the day of our Party¹s work. 
You see that in one form or another this question 
was several times raised by Trotsky in the shape of a 
veiled but quite definite controversy with Comrade 
Lenin, and that every time Trotsky handled the question 
not in the spirit of Lenin and Leninism, but in opposition 
to Lenin and Leninism. 
You see that Trotsky is telling a downright untruth 
when he asserts that the question of the building of 
socialism in one country was not raised by anybody 
prior to 1925.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 37 
5. The Special Importance of the Question 
of Building Socialism in the U.S.S.R. 
at the Present Moment 
Fifth question. The fifth question concerns the problem 
of the urgency of the task of building socialism at 
the present moment. Why has the question of building 
socialism assumed a specially urgent character just 
now, just in this recent period? Why is it that, whereas 
in 1915, 1918, 1919, 1921, 1922, 1923, for instance, the 
question of building socialism in the U.S.S.R. was 
discussed only occasionally, in individual articles, in 
1924, 1925, 1926 it has assumed a very prominent place 
in our Party activity? What is the explanation of that? 
In my opinion, the explanation lies in three chief 
causes. 
Firstly, in the fact that in the last few years the 
tempo of the revolution in other countries has slowed 
down, and what is called a ³partial stabilisation of 
capitalism² has set in. Hence the question: is not the 
partial stabilisation of capitalism tending to diminish 
or even to nullify the possibility of building socialism 
in our country? Hence the enhanced interest in the fate 
of socialism and socialist construction in our country. 
Secondly, in the fact that we have introduced NEP, 
have permitted private capital, and have to some extent 
retreated in order to regroup our forces and later on 
pass to the offensive. Hence the question: may not the 
introduction of NEP tend to diminish the possibility 
of socialist construction in our country? This is another 
source of the growing interest in the possibility of 
socialist construction in our country.

J. V. S T A L I N 38 
Thirdly, in the circumstance that we have won the 
Civil War, driven out the interventionists and won a 
³respite² from war, that we have assured ourselves 
peace and a peaceful period, offering favourable conditions 
for putting an end to economic disruption, restoring 
the country¹s productive forces, and setting 
about building a new economy in our country. Hence 
the question: in what direction must we conduct the 
building of our economy‹towards socialism, or in some 
other direction? Hence the question: if we are to conduct 
our building towards socialism, are there grounds 
for counting on being able to build socialism under the 
conditions of NEP and the partial stabilisation of capitalism? 
Hence the tremendous interest displayed by the 
entire Party and the entire working class in the fate 
of socialist construction in our country. Hence the annual 
computations of all sorts of factors made by the 
organs of the Party and the Soviet government with 
a view to enhancing the relative importance of the socialist 
forms of economy in the spheres of industry, trade 
and agriculture. 
There you have the three chief causes which indicate 
that the question of building socialism has become a 
most urgent one for our Party and our proletariat, as 
well as for the Comintern. 
The opposition considers that the question of building 
socialism in the U.S.S.R. is only of theoretical 
interest. That is not true. It is a profound error. Such 
an attitude to the question can only be attributed to the 
fact that the opposition is completely divorced from our 
practical Party work, our work of economic construction 
and our co-operative affairs. Now that we have put an end

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 39 
to economic disruption, have restored industry, and have 
entered a period of the reconstruction of our entire national 
economy on a new technical basis, the question of 
building socialism has assumed immense practical importance. 
What should we aim at in our work of economic 
construction, in what direction should we build, what 
should we build, what should be the perspective of our 
constructive work?‹these are all questions, without 
the settlement of which honest and thoughtful business 
executives cannot take a step forward if they want to 
adopt a really enlightened and considered attitude to 
the work of construction. Are we building in order to 
manure the soil for a bourgeois democracy, or in order 
to build a socialist society?‹this is now the root question 
of our constructive work. Are we in a position 
to build a socialist economy now, under the conditions 
of NEP and the partial stabilisation of capitalism?‹ 
this has now become one of the cardinal questions for 
our Party and Soviet work. 
Lenin answered this question in the affirmative (see, 
for example, his pamphlet On Co-operation). The Party 
has answered this question in the affirmative (see the resolution 
of the Fourteenth Conference of the R.C.P.(B.)). 
And what about the opposition? I have already said 
that the opposition answers this question in the negative. 
I have already said in my report at the Fifteenth Conference 
of the C.P.S.U.(B.), and I am obliged to 
repeat it here, that only quite recently, in September 
1926, Trotsky, the leader of the opposition bloc, declared 
in his message to the oppositionists that he 
considers the ³theory of socialism in one country² a 
³theoretical justification of national narrow-mindedness²

J. V. S T A L I N 40 
(see Stalin¹s report at the Fifteenth Conference of the 
C.P.S.U.(B.)13). 
Compare this quotation from Trotsky (1926) with his 
article of 1915 where, polemising with Lenin on the possibility 
of the victory of socialism in one country, he for 
the first time raised the question of the ³national narrow-
mindedness² of Comrade Lenin and the Leninists‹ 
and you will realise that Trotsky still adheres to his old 
position of Social-Democratic negation as regards the 
building of socialism in one country. 
That is precisely why the Party affirms that Trotskyism 
is a Social-Democratic deviation in our Party. 
6. The Perspectives of the Revolution 
Sixth question. The sixth question concerns the problem 
of the perspectives of the proletarian revolution. In his 
speech at the Fifteenth Party Conference, Trotsky said: 
³Lenin considered that we cannot possibly build socialism 
in 20 years, that in view of the backwardness of our 
peasant country we shall not build it even in 30 years. 
Let us take 30-50 years as a minimum.² 
I must say here, comrades, that this perspective, invented 
by Trotsky, has nothing in common with Comrade 
Lenin¹s perspective of the revolution in the U.S.S.R. 
A few minutes later, Trotsky himself in his speech began 
to challenge this perspective. But that is his affair. I, 
however, must declare that neither Lenin nor the Party 
can be held responsible for this perspective invented by 
Trotsky or for the conclusions that follow from it. The 
fact that Trotsky, having fabricated this perspective, 
later on in his speech began to challenge his own fabrica

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 41 
tion, only goes to show that Trotsky has got himself completely 
muddled and has put himself in a ridiculous position. 
Lenin did not say that ³we cannot possibly build 
socialism² in 30 or 50 years. In point of fact, what Lenin 
said was this: 
³Ten or 20 years of correct relations with the peasantry, and 
victory on a world scale is assured (even if the proletarian revolutions, 
which are growing, are delayed); otherwise, 20-40 years 
of the torments of white guard terrorism² (see Vol. XXVI, p. 313). 
From this proposition of Lenin¹s can the conclusion 
be drawn that we ³cannot possibly build socialism in 
20-30 or even 50 years²? No. From this proposition only 
the following conclusions can be drawn: 
a) given correct relations with the peasantry, we are 
assured of victory (i.e., the victory of socialism) in 
10-20 years; 
b) this victory will not only be a victory for the 
U.S.S.R.; it will be a victory ³on a world scale²; 
c) if we do not secure victory in this period, it will 
mean that we have been smashed, and that the regime 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat has been replaced 
by a regime of whiteguard terrorism, which may last 
20-40 years. 
Of course, one may agree or not agree with this proposition 
of Lenin¹s and the conclusions that follow from 
it. But to distort it, as Trotsky does, is impermissible. 
And what does victory ³on a world scale² mean? Does 
it mean that such a victory is equivalent to the victory of 
socialism in one country? No, it does not. In his writings, 
Lenin strictly distinguishes between the victory of

J. V. S T A L I N 42 
socialism in one country and victory ³on a world scale.² 
When Lenin speaks of victory ³on a world scale,² he 
means to say that the success of socialism in our country, 
the victory of socialist construction in our country, will 
have such tremendous international significance that that 
victory cannot be confined to our country, but is 
bound to call forth a powerful movement towards socialism 
in all capitalist countries, and that, moreover, 
if it does not coincide in time with the victory of the 
proletarian revolution in other countries, it must at 
any rate usher in a powerful movement of the proletarians 
of other countries towards the victory of the world 
revolution. 
Such is the perspective of the revolution as Lenin 
saw it, if we mean by this the perspective of the victory 
of the revolution, which, of course, is what we in our 
Party have in mind. 
To confuse this perspective with Trotsky¹s perspective 
of 30-50 years is to slander Lenin. 
7. How the Question Really Stands 
Seventh question. Suppose we grant this, the opposition 
says to us, but with whom, in the final analysis, 
is it better to maintain an alliance‹with the world 
proletariat, or with the peasantry of our country; to whom 
should we give preference‹to the world proletariat or 
the peasantry of the U.S.S.R.? In so doing, matters 
are depicted as if the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
stands confronted by two allies‹the world proletariat, 
which is prepared to overthrow its bourgeoisie at once, 
but is awaiting our preferential consent; and our peas

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 43 
antry, which is prepared to assist the proletariat of the 
U.S.S.R., but is not quite certain that the proletariat 
of the U.S.S.R. will accept its assistance. That, comrades, 
is a childish way of presenting the question. It 
is one that bears no relation either to the course of the 
revolution in our country or to the correlation of forces 
on the front of the struggle between world capitalism 
and socialism. Excuse me for saying so, but only schoolgirls 
can present the question in that way. Unfortunately, 
matters are not as some oppositionists depict them. 
Furthermore, there is no reason to doubt that we would 
gladly accept assistance from both parties, if it depended 
only on us. No, that is not the way the question stands 
in reality. 
The way the question stands is this: since the tempo 
of the world revolutionary movement has slowed down 
and socialism is not yet victorious in the West, but the 
proletariat of the U.S.S.R. is in power, is strengthening 
its power year by year, is rallying the main mass of 
the peasantry around it, is already registering substantial 
achievements on the front of socialist construction, 
and is successfully strengthening ties of friendship with 
the proletarians and oppressed peoples of all countries‹ 
are there any grounds for denying that the proletariat 
of the U.S.S.R. can overcome its bourgeoisie and continue 
the victorious building of socialism in our country, 
notwithstanding the capitalist encirclement? 
That is how the question stands now, provided, of 
course, we proceed not from fancy, as the opposition 
bloc does, but from the actual correlation of forces 
on the front of the struggle between socialism and capitalism.

J. V. S T A L I N 44 
The reply of the Party to this question is that the 
proletariat of the U.S.S.R. is, in these circumstances, 
capable of overcoming its own, ³national,² bourgeoisie 
and of successfully building a socialist economy. 
The opposition, however, says: 
³Without direct state* support from the European proletariat, 
the working class of Russia will not be able to maintain itself 
in power and to transform its temporary rule into a lasting 
socialist dictatorship² (see Trotsky, Our Revolution, p. 278). 
What is the significance of this quotation from Trotsky, 
and what does ³state support from the European 
proletariat² mean? It means that, without the preliminary 
victory of the proletariat in the West, without the preliminary 
seizure of power by the proletariat in the West, 
the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. will not only be incapable 
of overcoming its bourgeoisie and of building socialism, 
but will even be incapable of maintaining itself 
in power. 
That is how the question stands, and that is where 
the root of our disagreements lies. 
How does Trotsky¹s position differ from that of Otto 
Bauer, the Menshevik? 
Unfortunately, not at all. 
8. The Chances of Victory 
Eighth question. Suppose we grant this, the opposition 
says, but which has the greater chance of victory‹ 
the proletariat of the U.S.S.R., or the world proletariat? 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 45 
³Is it conceivable,² Trotsky said in his speech at the Fifteenth 
Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.), ³that in the next 30-50 
years European capitalism will continue to decay, but the proletariat 
will prove incapable of making a revolution? I ask: why 
should I accept this assumption, which can only be said to be an 
assumption of unjustified and gloomy pessimism regarding the 
European proletariat? . . . I affirm that I see no theoretical or political 
justification for believing that it will be easier for us to build 
socialism together with the peasantry, than for the European proletariat 
to take power² (see Trotsky¹s speech at the Fifteenth 
Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.)). 
Firstly, the perspective of stagnation in Europe ³in 
the next 30-50 years² must be rejected unreservedly. 
No one compelled Trotsky to proceed from this perspective 
of the proletarian revolution in the capitalist countries 
of the West, which has nothing in common with 
the perspective our Party envisages. Trotsky has fettered 
himself with this fictitious perspective, and he must 
himself answer for the consequences of such an operation. 
I think that this period must be reduced by at least 
half, if the actual perspective of the proletarian revolution 
in the West is borne in mind. 
Secondly, Trotsky decides without reservation that 
the proletarians of the West have a much greater chance of 
overcoming the world bourgeoisie, which is now in power, 
than the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. has of overcoming 
its own, ³national,² bourgeoisie, which has already 
been smashed politically, has been cast out of the key positions 
in the national economy, and, economically, is 
compelled to retreat under the pressure of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and the socialist forms of our economy. 
I consider that such a way of presenting the question 
is incorrect. I consider that, in putting the question

J. V. S T A L I N 46 
in that way, Trotsky completely betrays himself. 
Did not the Mensheviks t e l l us the same thing in 
October 1917, when they cried from the house-tops 
that the proletarians of the West had a far greater chance 
of overthrowing the bourgeoisie and seizing power than 
the proletarians of Russia, where technical development 
was weak and the proletariat numerically small? And 
is it not a fact that, in spite of the lamentations of the 
Mensheviks, the proletarians of Russia in October 1917 
proved to have had a greater chance of seizing power and 
overthrowing the bourgeoisie than the proletarians of 
Britain, France or Germany? Has not the experience of 
the revolutionary struggle throughout the world demonstrated 
and proved that the question cannot be put in 
the way that Trotsky puts it? 
Who has the greater chance of a speedy victory is a 
question that is not decided by contrasting the 
proletariat of one country with the proletariat of other 
countries, or the peasantry of our country with the proletariat 
of other countries. Such contrasting is mere childishness. 
Who has the greater chance of a speedy victory 
is a question that is decided by the real international 
situation, by the real correlation of forces on the 
front of the struggle between capitalism and socialism. 
It may happen that the proletarians of the West will 
defeat their bourgeoisie and seize power before we succeed 
in laying a socialist foundation for our economy. 
That is by no means excluded. But it may happen that 
the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. will succeed in laying 
a socialist foundation for our economy before the proletarians 
of the West overthrow their bourgeoisie. That 
is not excluded either.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 47 
The question of the chances of a speedy victory is 
one the decision of which depends upon the real situation 
on the front of the struggle between capitalism and 
socialism, and upon it alone. 
9. Disagreements over Political Practice 
Such are the bases of our disagreements. 
From these bases spring disagreements over political 
practice, both in the fields of foreign and home policy, 
and in the purely Party field. These disagreements 
form the subject of the ninth question. 
a) The Party, proceeding from the fact of the partial 
stabilisation of capitalism, considers that we are in a 
period between revolutions, that in the capitalist countries 
we are moving towards revolution and the principal 
task of the Communist Parties is to establish a path 
to the masses, to strengthen connections with the 
masses, to win the mass organisations of the proletariat 
and prepare the broad mass of the workers for the coming 
revolutionary clashes. 
The opposition, however, having no faith in the internal 
forces of our revolution, and fearing the fact of 
the partial stabilisation of capitalism as capable of destroying 
our revolution, considers (or considered) it possible 
to deny the fact of the partial stabilisation of capitalism, 
considers (or considered) the British strike14 a 
sign that the stabilisation of capitalism has ended; and 
when it turns out that stabilisation is a fact nevertheless‹
so much the worse for the facts, the oppositiondeclares, 
and that it is possible, therefore, to skip overthe 
facts, and in this connection it demonstratively comes

J. V. S T A L I N 48 
out with noisy slogans for a revision of the united front 
tactics, for a rupture with the trade-union movement 
in the West, and so on. 
But what does disregarding the facts, disregarding 
the objective course of things, mean? It means abandoning 
science for quackery. 
Hence the adventurist character of the policy of the 
opposition bloc. 
b) The Party, proceeding from the fact that industrialisation 
is the principal means of socialist construction, 
and that the principal market for socialist industry is 
the home market of our country, considers that the development 
of industrialisation must be based upon a 
steady improvement of the material conditions of the 
main mass of the peasantry (to say nothing of the workers), 
that a bond between industry and peasant economy, 
between the proletariat and the peasantry, with the leadership 
of the proletariat in the bond, is, as Lenin expressed 
it, the ³alpha and omega of Soviet power²15 and 
of the success of our constructive work, and that therefore 
our policy in general, and our taxation policy and 
price policy in particular, must be so constructed as to 
answer to the interests of this bond. 
The opposition, however, having no faith in the possibility 
of drawing the peasantry into the work of building 
socialism and obviously believing that it is permissible 
to carry out industrialisation to the detriment 
of the main mass of the peasantry, is inclined towards 
capitalist methods of industrialisation, is inclined to 
regard the peasantry as a ³colony,² as an object of ³exploitation² 
by the proletarian state, and proposes such 
methods of industrialisation (increased taxation of the

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 49 
peasantry, higher wholesale prices for manufactured 
goods, etc.) as are calculated only to disrupt the bond between 
industry and peasant economy, undermine the economic 
position of the poor and middle peasantry, and 
shatter the very foundations of industrialisation. 
Hence the opposition¹s attitude of disapproval towards 
the idea of a bloc between the proletariat and 
the peasantry, and the hegemony of the proletariat 
in this bloc‹an attitude characteristic of Social-Democracy. 
c) We proceed from the fact that the Party, the Communist 
Party, is the principal instrument of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat, that the leadership of one party, which 
does not and cannot share this leadership with other parties, 
constitutes that fundamental condition without which 
no firm and developed dictatorship of the proletariat is 
conceivable. In view of this, we regard the existence of 
factions within our Party as impermissible, for it is selfevident 
that the existence of organised factions within 
the Party must lead to the splitting of the united Party 
into parallel organisations, to the formation of embryos 
and nuclei of a new party or parties in the country, and, 
hence, to the disintegration of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. 
The opposition, however, while not contesting these 
propositions openly, nevertheless in its practical work 
proceeds from the necessity of weakening the unity of 
the Party, the necessity of freedom of factions within 
the Party, and therefore‹the necessity of creating the 
elements of a new party. 
Hence the splitting policy in the practical work of 
the opposition bloc.

J. V. S T A L I N 50 
Hence the outcry of the opposition against the ³regime² 
in the Party, an outcry which, in point of fact, is a 
reflection of the protests of the non-proletarian elements 
in the country against the regime of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat. 
Hence the question of two parties. 
Such, comrades, is the sum and substance of our disagreements 
with the opposition. 
IV 
THE OPPOSITION AT WORK 
Let us pass now to the question how these disagreements 
have manifested themselves in practical work. 
Wel l then, what did our opposition look like in 
actual fact in its practical work, in its struggle against 
the Party? 
We know that the opposition was operating not only in 
our Party, but in other sections of the Comintern as well, 
for instance in Germany, France, etc. Therefore, the question 
must be put in this way: what in actual fact did 
the practical work of the opposition and its followers 
look like both in the C.P.S.U.(B.) and in other sections 
of the Comintern? 
a) The practical work of the opposition and its followers 
in the C.P.S.U.(B.). The opposition began its ³work² 
by levelling very grave charges against the Party. It 
declared that the Party ³is sliding into opportunism.² 
The opposition asserted that the Party¹s policy ³runs 
counter to the class line of the revolution.² The opposition 
asserted that the Party is degenerating and moving 
towards a Thermidor. The opposition declared that our

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 51 
state is ³far from being a proletarian state.² All this 
was affirmed either in open declarations and speeches of 
representatives of the opposition (at the July Plenum of 
the Central Committee and Central Control Commission 
in 1926), or in secret documents of the opposition disseminated 
by its supporters. 
But, in levelling these grave charges against the 
Party, the opposition created the basis for the organisation 
of new, parallel units within the Party, for the organisation 
of a new, parallel Party centre, for the formation 
of a new party. One of the supporters of the opposition, 
Mr. Ossovsky, bluntly declared in his articles 
that the existing party, our Party, defends the interests 
of the capitalists, and that in view of this a new party, 
a ³purely proletarian party,² must be formed, existing 
and functioning side by side with the present party. 
The opposition may say that it is not answerable 
for Ossovsky¹s attitude. But that is not true. I t is 
fully and entirely answerable for the ³doings² of Mr. Ossovsky. 
We know that Ossovsky openly declared himself 
a supporter of the opposition, and the opposition 
never once attempted to contest this. We know, further, 
that at the July Plenum of the Central Committee 
Trotsky defended Ossovsky against Comrade Molotov. We 
know, lastly, that despite the unanimous opinion of the 
Party against Ossovsky, the opposition voted in the 
Central Committee against Ossovsky¹s expulsion from 
the Party. All this indicates that the opposition assumed 
moral responsibility for Ossovsky¹s ³doings.² 
Conclusion: the practical work of the opposition in 
the C.P.S.U.(B.) manifested itself in the attitude of 
Ossovsky, in his view that a new party must be formed

J. V. S T A L I N 52 
in our country, parallel with and opposed to the 
C.P.S.U.(B.). 
Indeed, it could not be otherwise. For either one 
thing or the other: 
either the opposition, when levelling these grave 
charges against the Party, did not itself mean them seriously 
and levelled them only as a demonstration‹in 
which case it was misleading the working class, which 
is a crime; 
or the opposition meant, and still means, its charges 
seriously‹in which case it should have steered a course, 
as indeed it did, towards the rout of the leading cadres 
of the Party and the formation of a new party. 
Such was the complexion of our opposition as displayed 
in its practical work against the C.P.S.U.(B.) by 
October 1926. 
b) The practical work of the opposition¹s followers 
in the German Communist Party. Proceeding from the 
charges levelled against the Party by our opposition, 
the ³ultra-Lefts² in Germany, headed by Herr Korsch, 
drew ³further² conclusions and dotted the i¹s and crossed 
the t¹s. We know that Korsch, that ideologist of the 
German ³ultra-Lefts,² asserts that our socialist industry 
is a ³purely capitalist industry.² We know that 
Korsch dubs our Party a ³kulakised² party, and the Comintern 
an ³opportunist² organisation. We know, further, 
that, in view of this, Korsch preaches the necessity 
for a ³new revolution,² directed against the existing 
regime in the U.S.S.R. 
The opposition may say that it is not answerable for 
Korsch¹s attitude. But that is not true. The opposition 
is fully and entirely answerable for the ³doings² of

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 53 
Herr Korsch. What Korsch says is a natural conclusion 
from the premises preached by the leaders of our opposition 
to their supporters in the shape of the charges 
against the Party. Because, if the Party is sliding into opportunism, 
if its policy diverges from the class line of the 
revolution, if it is degenerating and moving towards a 
Thermidor, and our state is ³far from being a proletarian 
state,² only one inference can be drawn from this, 
namely, the necessity for a new revolution, a revolution 
against the ³kulakised² regime. Apart from this, we 
know that the German ³ultra-Lefts,² including the Weddingites,
16 voted against the expulsion of Korsch from the 
party, thereby assuming moral responsibility for Korsch¹s 
counter-revolutionary propaganda. Well, and who does 
not know that the ³ultra-Lefts² support the opposition 
in the C.P.S.U.(B.)? 
c) The practical work of the opposition¹s followers 
in France. The same must be said of the opposition¹s 
followers in France. I am referring to Souvarine and his 
group, who run a notorious magazine in France. Proceeding 
from the premises provided by our opposition in its 
charges against the Party, Souvarine draws the conclusion 
that the chief enemy of the revolution is the Party bureaucracy, 
the top leadership of our Party. Souvarine 
asserts that there is only one ³salvation²‹a new revolution, 
a revolution against the top leadership in the Party 
and the government, a revolution, primarily, against 
the Secretariat of the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.). There, in 
Germany, a ³new revolution² against the existing 
regime in the U.S.S.R. Here, in France, a ³new revolution² 
against the Secretariat of the C.C. Well, and 
how is this new revolution to be organised? Can it be

J. V. S T A L I N 54 
organised without a separate party adapted to the aims 
of the new revolution? Of course not. Hence the question 
of creating a new party. 
The opposition may say that it is not answerable for 
Souvarine¹s writings. But that is not true. We know, firstly, 
that Souvarine and his group are supporters of the 
opposition, especially its Trotskyist section. We know, 
secondly, that only quite recently the opposition was 
planning to instal M. Souvarine on the editorial board 
of the central organ of the French Communist Party. 
True, that plan failed. That, however, was not the 
fault but the misfortune of our opposition. 
Thus it follows that the opposition in its practical 
work, taking the opposition not in the form in which 
it depicts itself, but in the form in which it manifests 
itself in the course of work both in our country, the 
U.S.S.R., and in France and Germany‹it follows, I say, 
that the opposition in its practical work is directly 
facing the question of routing the existing cadres of 
our Party and forming a new party. 
V 
WHY THE ENEMIES OF THE DICTATORSHIP 
OF THE PROLETARIAT PRAISE THE OPPOSITION 
Why do the Social-Democrats and the Cadets praise 
the opposition? 
Or, in other words, whose sentiments does the opposition 
reflect? 
You have probably observed that the so-called ³Russian 
question² has of late become a burning question of 
the Social-Democratic and bourgeois press in the West. 
Is this accidental? Of course not. The progress of social

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 55 
ism in the U.S.S.R. and the development of the communist 
movement in the West cannot but inspire profound 
alarm in the ranks of the bourgeoisie and its agents 
in the working class‹the Social-Democratic leaders. 
The dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution 
nowadays lies between the bitter hatred of some 
and the comradely friendship of others for the proletarian 
Party of the U.S.S.R. The cardinal international significance 
of the ³Russian question² is now a fact with 
which the enemies of communism cannot but reckon. 
Around the ³Russian question² two fronts have 
formed: the front of the enemies of the Republic of 
Soviets, and the front of its devoted friends. What do the 
enemies of the Republic of Soviets want? They are out 
to create among the broad masses of the population the 
ideological and moral prerequisites for a fight against 
the proletarian dictatorship. What do the friends of 
the Republic of Soviets want? They are out to create 
among the broad strata of the proletariat the ideological 
and moral prerequisites for supporting and defending 
the Republic of Soviets. 
Let us now examine why the Social-Democrats and 
Cadets among the Russian bourgeois emigres praise our 
opposition. 
Here, for instance, is what Paul Levi, a well-known 
Social-Democratic leader in Germany, says: 
³We were of the opinion that the special interests of the workers‹
in the final analysis, the interests of socialism‹run counter 
to the existence of peasant ownership, that the identity of interests 
of workers and peasants is only an illusion, and that as 
the Russian revolution developed this contradiction would become 
acute and more apparent. We considered the idea of community of

J. V. S T A L I N 56 
interests another form of the idea of coalition. If Marxism has any 
shadow of justification at all, if history develops dialectically, 
then this contradiction was bound to shatter the coalition idea, just 
as it has already been shattered in Germany. . . . To us who observe 
developments in the U.S.S.R. from farther away, from Western 
Europe, it is clear that our views coincide with the views of the opposition. 
. . . The fact is there: an independent, anti-capitalist movement 
under the banner of the class struggle is again beginningin 
Russia² (Leipziger Volkszeitung, July 30, 1926). 
That there is confusion in this quotation regarding 
the ³identity² of the interests of the workers and peasants 
is obvious. But that Paul Levi is praising our opposition 
for its struggle against the idea of a bloc of the 
workers and peasants, the idea of an alliance of the 
workers and peasants, is likewise indubitable. 
Here is what the not unnotorious Dan, leader of the 
³Russian² Social-Democrats, leader of the ³Russian² 
Mensheviks who advocate the restoration of capitalism 
in the U.S.S.R., has to say about our opposition: 
³By their criticism of the existing system, which repeats 
the Social-Democratic criticism almost word for word, the Bolshevik 
opposition is preparing minds . . . for the acceptance 
of the positive platform of Social-Democracy.² 
And further: 
³Not only among the mass of the workers, but among communist 
workers as well, the opposition is rearing the shoots of ideas 
and sentiments which, if skilfully tended, may easily bear Social- 
Democratic fruit² (Sotsialistichesky Vestnik, No. 17-18). 
Clear, I think. 
And here is what Posledniye Novosti,17 central organ 
of Milyukov¹s counter-revolutionary bourgeois party, 
says of our opposition:

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 57 
³Today, the opposition i s undermining the dictatorship, 
every new publication of the opposition utters more and more 
Œterrible¹ words, the opposition itself is evolving in the direction 
of increasingly violent assaults on the prevailing system; and this 
for the time being is enough for us to accept it with gratitude as 
a mouthpiece for wide sections of the politically dissatisfied 
population² (Posledniye Novosti, No. 1990). 
And further: 
³The most formidable enemy of the Soviet power today is 
the one that creeps upon it unawares, grips it in its tentacles on 
all sides, and destroys it before it realises that it has been destroyed. 
It is precisely this role‹inevitable and necessary in the preparatory 
period from which we have not yet emerged‹that the 
Soviet opposition is performing² (Posledniye Novosti, No. 1983, 
August 27 of this year). 
Comment, I think, is superfluous. 
I confine myself to these quotations owing to shortness 
of time, although scores and hundreds like them 
might be cited. 
That is why the Social-Democrats and the Cadets 
praise our opposition. 
Is this accidental? No, it is not. 
It will be seen from this that the opposition reflects 
not the sentiments of the proletariat of our country, but 
the sentiments of the non-proletarian elements who are 
dissatisfied with the dictatorship of the proletariat, incensed 
against the dictatorship of the proletariat, and 
are waiting with impatience for it to disintegrate and 
collapse. 
Thus the logic of the factional struggle of our opposition 
has led in practice to the front of our opposition 
objectively merging with the front of the opponents and 
enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

J. V. S T A L I N 58 
Did the opposition want this? It is to be presumed 
it did not. But the point here is not what the opposition 
wants, but where its factional struggle objectively 
leads. The logic of the factional struggle is stronger than 
the wishes of particular individuals. And precisely because 
of this it has come to pass that the opposition front 
has in practice merged with the front of the opponents 
and enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Lenin taught us that the basic duty of Communists 
is to defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
But what has happened is that the opposition, 
because of its factional policy, has landed in the 
camp of the opponents of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
That is why we say that the opposition has broken 
with Leninism not only in theory, but also in practice. 
Indeed, it could not be otherwise. The correlation 
of forces on the front of the struggle between capitalism 
and socialism is such that only one of two policies is 
now possible within the ranks of the working class: either 
the policy of communism, or the policy of Social-Democracy. 
The attempt of the opposition to occupy a third 
position, while spearheading the struggle against the 
C.P.S.U.(B.), was inevitably bound to result in its being 
thrown by the very course of the factional struggle 
into the camp of the enemies of Leninism. 
And that is exactly what has happened, as the facts 
quoted show. 
That is why the Social-Democrats and Cadets praise 
the opposition.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 59 
VI 
DEFEAT OF THE OPPOSITION BLOC 
I have already said that in their struggle against 
the Party the opposition operated by means of very grave 
charges against the Party. I have said that, in their practical 
work, the opposition came to the very verge of 
the idea of a split and the formation of a new party. 
The question therefore arises: how long did the opposition 
succeed in maintaining this splitting attitude? The facts 
show that it succeeded in maintaining this attitude for 
only a few months. The facts show that by the beginning 
of October of this year the opposition was compelled 
to acknowledge its defeat and to retreat. 
What brought about the retreat of the opposition? 
In my opinion, the retreat of the opposition was 
brought about by the following causes. 
Firstly, by the fact that in the U.S.S.R. the opposition 
found itself without a political army. It may very 
well be that the building of a new party is an entertaining 
occupation. But if, after a discussion, it turns out 
that there is nobody to build a new party from, then 
obviously retreat is the only way out. 
Secondly, by the fact that in the course of the factional 
struggle all sorts of sordid elements, both in our country, 
the U.S.S.R., and abroad, attached themselves 
to the opposition, and that the Social-Democrats and 
Cadets began to praise it for all they were worth, shaming 
and disgracing it in the eyes of the workers with their 
kisses. The opposition was left with the choice: either to 
accept these praises and kisses of the enemy as their 
due, or to make an abrupt turn and retreat, so that the

J. V. S T A L I N 60 
sordid appendages that had attached themselves to the 
opposition should mechanically fall away. By retreating, 
and acknowledging its retreat, the opposition confessed 
that the latter way out was for it the only acceptable 
one. 
Thirdly, by the fact that the situation in the U.S.S.R. 
proved to be better than the opposition had assumed, 
and the mass of the Party membership proved to be 
more politically conscious and united than it might have 
seemed to the opposition at the beginning of the struggle. 
Of course, if there had been a crisis in the country, 
if discontent had been mounting among the workers, 
and i f the Party had displayed less solidarity, the 
opposition would have taken a different course and not 
have decided to retreat. But the facts have shown 
that the calculations of the opposition came to naught 
in this field also. 
Hence the defeat of the opposition. 
Hence its retreat. 
The opposition¹s defeat passed through three 
stages. 
The first stage was the opposition¹s ³statement² of 
October 6, 1926. In this document the opposition renounced 
the theory and practice of freedom of factions 
and factional methods of struggle, and publicly and 
unequivocally admitted its errors in this sphere. But 
that was not all that the opposition renounced. By dissociating 
itself in its ³statement² from the ³Workers¹ 
Opposition² and the Korsches and Souvarines of every 
brand, the opposition thereby renounced those ideological 
positions it had held which had recently brought 
it close to those trends.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 61 
The second stage was the opposition¹s virtual renunciation 
of the charges it had recently been levelling 
against the Party. I t must be admitted and, having 
admitted it, it must be stressed that the opposition did 
not venture to repeat its charges against the Party at 
the Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.). If one 
compares the minutes of the July Plenum of the Central 
Committee and Central Control Commission with the 
minutes of the Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.), 
one cannot help noting that at the Fifteenth Conference 
not a trace remained of the old charges of opportunism, 
Thermidorism, sliding away from the class line 
of the revolution, etc. Furthermore, bearing in mind 
the circumstance that a number of delegates questioned 
the opposition about its former charges, and that 
the opposition maintained a stubborn silence on 
this point, i t must be admitted that the opposition 
has in fact renounced its former charges against the 
Party. 
Can this circumstance be qualified as a virtual renunciation 
by the opposition of a number of its ideological 
positions? It can, and should be. It means that the 
opposition has deliberately furled its battle-standard in 
face of its defeat. It could not, indeed, be otherwise. The 
charges were levelled in the expectation of building a 
new party. But since these expectations fell to the 
ground, the charges had to fall to the ground too, at 
least for the time being. 
The third stage was the complete isolation of the opposition 
at the Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
It should be remarked that at the Fifteenth Conference 
not a single vote was given to the opposition, and

J. V. S T A L I N 62 
thus it found itself in complete isolation. Recall the 
hullabaloo raised by the Opposition towards the end of 
September of this year, when it launched the attack, 
the open attack on the Party, and compare this clamour 
with the fact that at the Fifteenth Conference the opposition 
found itself, so to speak, in the singular number‹
and you will realise that the opposition could not 
be wished a ³better² defeat. 
Can the fact be denied that the opposition has indeed 
renounced its charges against the Party, not having 
dared to repeat them at the Fifteenth Conference in 
spite of the demands of the delegates? 
No, it cannot, because it is a fact. 
Why did the opposition take this course; why did 
it furl its banner? 
Because the unfurling of the ideological banner of 
the opposition necessarily and inevitably signifies the 
theory of two parties, the reanimation of all the various 
brands of Katzes, Korsches, Maslows, Souvarines and 
other sordid elements, the unleashing of the anti-proletarian 
forces in our country, the praises and kisses of 
the Social-Democrats and the bourgeois-liberal Russian 
émigrés. 
The ideological banner of the opposition is fatal to 
the opposition‹that is the point, comrades. 
Therefore, in order not to perish altogether, the 
opposition was forced to retreat and to cast away its 
banner. 
That is the basic reason for the defeat of the opposition 
bloc.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 63 
VII 
THE PRACTICAL MEANING AND IMPORTANCE 
OF THE FIFTEENTH CONFERENCE 
OF THE C.P.S.U.(B.) 
I am concluding, comrades. It only remains for me 
to say a few words on the conclusions as regards the 
meaning and importance of the decisions of the Fifteenth 
Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
The first conclusion is that the conference summed 
up the inner-Party struggle since the Fourteenth Congress, 
gave definite shape to the victory scored by the 
Party over the opposition and, by isolating the opposition, 
put an end to that factional orgy which the opposition 
had forced upon our Party in the previous period. 
The second conclusion is that the conference cemented 
our Party more solidly than ever before, on the basis 
of the socialist perspective of our constructive work, 
on the basis of the idea of the struggle for the victory of 
socialist construction against all opposition trends and 
all deviations in our Party. 
The most urgent question in our Party today is that 
of the building of socialism in our country. Lenin was 
right when he said that the eyes of the whole world are 
upon us, upon our economic construction, upon our 
achievements on the front of constructive work. But in 
order to achieve successes on this front, the principal 
instrument of the dictatorship of the proletariat, our 
Party, must be ready for this work, must realise the importance 
of this task, and must be able to serve as the 
lever of the victory of socialist construction in our 
country. The meaning and importance of the Fifteenth 
Conference is that it gave definite shape to and crowned

J. V. S T A L I N 64 
the arming of our Party with the idea of the victory of 
socialist construction in our country. 
The third conclusion is that the conference administered 
a decisive rebuff to all ideological vacillations 
in our Party and thereby facilitated the full triumph of 
Leninism in the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
If the Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee 
of the Comintern approves the decisions of the Fifteenth 
Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.) and recognises the 
correctness of our Party¹s policy towards the opposition‹
as I have no reason to doubt it will‹this will 
lead to a fourth conclusion, namely, that the Fifteenth 
Conference has created certain by no means unimportant 
conditions essential for the triumph of Leninism throughout 
the Comintern, in the ranks of the revolutionary proletariat 
of all countries and nations. (Stormy applause. 
An ovation from the entire plenum.)

REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION 
December 13 
I 
MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS 
1. We Need Facts, Not Inventions 
and Tittle-Tattle 
Comrades, before passing to the substance of the 
question, permit me to make a few factual corrections to 
statements of the opposition, statements which either 
distort the facts or are inventions or tittle-tattle. 
1) The first question is that of the speeches of the 
opposition at the Enlarged Plenum of the E.C.C.I. The 
opposition declared that i t had decided to take the 
floor because the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) had not directly 
intimated that by doing so it might be violating the 
opposition¹s ³statement² of October 16, 1926, and that if 
the C.C. had forbidden it to speak, the opposition leaders 
would not have ventured to do so. 
The opposition further declared that in speaking 
here at the Enlarged Plenum it would take every precaution 
not to aggravate the struggle; that it would confine 
itself to mere ³explanations², that it had no thought 
of attacking the Party, God forbid; that it was not its 
intention, God forbid, to level any charges against the 
Party or to appeal against its decisions.

J. V. S T A L I N 66 
That is all untrue, comrades. It is totally at variance 
with the facts. It is hypocrisy on the part of the opposition. 
The facts have shown, and particularly the 
statement of Kamenev has shown, that the speeches of 
the opposition leaders at the Enlarged Plenum were not 
³explanations,² but an attack, an assault, on the Party. 
What does publicly accusing the Party of a Right 
deviation mean? It is an attack on the Party, a sortie 
against the Party. 
Did not the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) indicate in its resolution 
that if the opposition were to take the floor it 
would aggravate the struggle, give an impetus to the 
factional conflict? Yes, it did. That was a warning to 
the opposition on the part of the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.). 
Could the C.C. go farther than that? No, it could not. 
Why? Because the C.C. could not forbid the opposition 
to speak. Every member of the Party has the right to 
appeal against a Party decision to a higher body. The 
C.C. could not ignore this right of Party members. 
Hence, the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) did all that lay in its 
power to prevent a new aggravation of the struggle, a new 
intensification of the factional conflict. 
The opposition leaders, who are members of the C.C., 
must have known that their speeches were bound to take 
the form of an appeal against the decisions of their Party, 
the form of a sortie against the Party, an attack on the 
Party. 
Consequently, the speeches of the opposition, especially 
Kamenev¹s‹which was not his own personal 
statement but that of the whole opposition bloc, because 
this speech, which he read from a manuscript, was 
signed by Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev‹this speech

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
67 
of Kamenev¹s represents a turning point in the development 
of the opposition bloc, away from the ³statement² 
of October 16, 1926, in which the opposition renounced 
factional methods of struggle, and towards a new phase 
in the opposition¹s existence, one in which they are 
reverting to factional methods of struggle against the 
Party. 
Hence the conclusion: the opposition has violated 
its own ³statement² of October 16, 1926, by reverting 
to factional methods of struggle. 
Well then, let us say so frankly, comrades. There 
is no point in dissembling. Kamenev was right when he 
said that a cat should be called a cat. (Voices: ³Quite 
right!² ³And a swine, a swine.²) 
2) Trotsky said in his speech that ³after the February 
Revolution Stalin preached erroneous tactics, which 
Lenin characterised as a Kautskyan deviation.² 
That is not true, comrades. It is tittle-tattle. 
Stalin did not ³preach² any Kautskyan deviation. That 
I had certain waverings after my return from exile, 
I have not concealed, and I wrote about them myself in 
my pamphlet On the Road to October. But who of us has 
not been subject to transitory waverings? As to Lenin¹s 
position and his April Theses18 of 1917‹which is what 
is meant here‹the Party knows very well that at that 
time I stood in the same ranks as Comrade Lenin, against 
Kamenev and his group, who were at that time putting 
up a fight against Lenin¹s theses. Those who are familiar 
with the minutes of the April Conference of our 
Party in 1917 cannot but know that I stood in the same 
ranks as Lenin and together with him fought the opposition 
of Kamenev. 
THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I.

J. V. S T A L I N 68 
The trick here is that Trotsky has confused me 
with Kamenev. (Laughter. Applause.) 
It is true that at that time Kamenev was in opposition 
to Lenin, to his theses, to the majority of the Party, 
and expounded views which bordered on defencism. It 
is true that at that time, in March, for instance, Kamenev 
was writing articles of a semi-defencist character 
in Pravda, for which articles, of course, I cannot in any 
degree be held responsible. 
Trotsky¹s trouble is that he has confused Stalin with 
Kamenev. 
Where Trotsky was then, at the time of the April 
Conference in 1917, when the Party was waging a fight 
against Kamenev¹s group; which party he belonged to 
then‹the Left-Menshevik or the Right-Menshevik‹and 
why he was not in the ranks of the Zimmerwald Left,19 
let Trotsky tell us himself, in the press if he likes. But 
that he was not at that time in our Party is a fact which 
Trotsky would do well to remember. 
3) Trotsky said in his speech that ³Stalin committed 
rather grave mistake on the national question.² What 
mistake, and under what circumstances, Trotsky did 
not say. 
That i s not true, comrades. I t i s t i t t l e - t a t t l e . I 
never have been in disagreement with the Party or with 
Lenin on the national question. What Trotsky is presumably 
referring to is an insignificant incident which happened 
before the Twelfth Congress of our Party, when 
Comrade Lenin rebuked me for conducting too severe an 
organisational policy towards the Georgian semi-nationalists, 
semi-Communists of the type of Mdivani‹who 
was recently our trade representative in France‹that I

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 69 
was ³persecuting² them. Subsequent facts, however, 
showed that the so-called ³deviationists,² people of the 
Mdivani type, actually deserved to be treated more severely 
than I, as one of the secretaries of the C.C. of our Party, 
treated them. Subsequent events showed that the ³deviationists² 
were a degenerating faction of the most arrant 
opportunism. Let Trotsky prove that this is not so. Lenin 
was not aware of these facts, and could not be aware 
of them, because he was ill in bed and had no opportunity 
to follow events. But what bearing can this insignificant 
incident have on Stalin¹s position based on principle? 
Trotsky is here obviously hinting in tittle-tattle 
fashion at certain ³disagreements² between the Party 
and myself. But is it not a fact that the C.C. as a whole, 
including Trotsky, unanimously voted for Stalin¹s 
theses on the national question? Is it not a fact that this 
vote took place after the Mdivani incident, and before 
the Twelfth Congress of our Party? Is it not a fact that 
the reporter on the national question at the Twelfth 
Congress was none other than Stalin? Where, then, are 
the ³disagreements² on the national question, and why 
indeed did Trotsky desire to recall this insignificant 
incident? 
4) Kamenev declared in his speech that the Fourteenth 
Congress of our Party committed an error in ³opening 
fire against the Left²‹that is, against the opposition. 
It appears that the Party fought, and continues to 
fight, the revolutionary core of the Party. It appears that 
our opposition is a Left, not a Right, opposition. 
That is all nonsense, comrades. It is tittle-tattle 
spread by our oppositionists. The Fourteenth Congress 
did not think of opening, and could not have opened,

J. V. S T A L I N 70 
fire on the revolutionary majority. In point of fact, it 
opened fire on the Rights, on our oppositionists, who constitute 
a Right opposition, although draped in a ³Left² 
toga. Naturally, the opposition is inclined to regard itself 
as a ³revolutionary Left.² But the Fourteenth Congress 
of our Party found, on the contrary, that the opposition 
was only masking itself with ³Left² phrases, but in 
point of fact was an opportunist opposition. We know 
that a Right opposition often masquerades in a ³Left² 
toga in order to mislead the working class. The ³Workers¹ 
Opposition² likewise considered itself to be more to 
the Left than anyone else, but proved in reality to be 
more to the Right than anyone else. The present opposition 
also believes itself to be more to the Left than 
anyone else; but the practical activities and the whole 
work of the present opposition prove that it is a centre 
of attraction and a rallying point for all Right opportunist 
trends, from the ³Workers¹ Opposition² and 
Trotskyism to the ³New Opposition² and the Souvarines 
of every brand. 
Kamenev performed a ³slight² piece of juggling with 
³Lefts² and ³Rights.² 
5) Kamenev quoted a passage from Lenin¹s works 
to the effect that we had not yet completely laid a socialist 
foundation for our economy, and declared that 
the Party was committing an error in asserting that we 
had already completely laid a socialist foundation for 
our economy. 
That is nonsense, comrades. It is petty tittle-tattle 
on Kamenev¹s part. Never yet has the Party declared 
that it has already completely laid a socialist foundation 
for our economy. Whether we have or have not

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 71 
completely laid a socialist foundation for our economy 
is not the point at issue at all just now. That is not the 
point at issue just now. The only point at issue is, can 
we or can we not completely lay a socialist foundation 
for our economy by our own efforts? The Party affirms 
that we are in a position to completely lay a socialist 
foundation for our economy. The opposition denies this, 
and thereby slides into defeatism and capitulationism. 
That is the point at issue just now. Kamenev feels how 
untenable his position is and is trying to evade this 
issue. But he will not succeed. 
Kamenev performed another ³slight² piece of juggling. 
6) Trotsky declared in his speech that he ³anticipated 
Lenin¹s policy in March-April 1917.² It thus follows 
that Trotsky ³anticipated² Comrade Lenin¹s 
April Theses. It follows that Trotsky had already in February-
March 1917 independently arrived at the policy 
which Comrade Lenin advocated in his April Theses 
in April-May 1917. 
Permit me to say, comrades, that this is stupid and 
unseemly boastfulness. Trotsky ³anticipating² Lenin 
is a spectacle that can only evoke laughter. The peasants 
are quite right when they say in such cases: ³This is comparing 
a fly to a watch tower.² (Laughter.) Trotsky 
³anticipating² Lenin. . . . Let Trotsky venture to come 
out and prove this in print. Why has he never tried 
to do so even once? Trotsky ³anticipated² Lenin. . . . 
But, in that case, how is the fact to be explained that 
Comrade Lenin, from the first moment of his appearance 
in the Russian arena in April 1917, deemed it necessary 
to dissociate himself from Trotsky¹s position?

J. V. S T A L I N 72 
How is the fact to be explained that the ³anticipated² 
found it necessary to disavow the ³anticipator²? Is it 
not a fact that Lenin declared on several occasions in 
April 1917 that he was totally at variance with Trotsky¹s 
basic formula: ³No tsar, but a workers¹ government²? 
Is it not a fact that Lenin at that time repeatedly declared 
that he was totally at variance with Trotsky, who 
was trying to skip over the peasant movement, the 
agrarian revolution? 
Where, then, is the ³anticipation² here? 
The conclusion is: we need facts, not inventions 
and tittle tattle, whereas the opposition prefers to operate 
with inventions and tittle-tattle. 
2. Why the Enemies of the Dictatorship 
of the Proletariat Praise the Opposition 
I said in my report that the enemies of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat, the Menshevik and Cadet Russian 
émigrés, praise the opposition. I said that they praise 
the opposition for activity which tends to undermine 
the unity of the Party, and, hence, to undermine the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. I quoted a number of 
passages showing that it is precisely on this account 
that the enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
praise the opposition, on account of the fact that the 
opposition by its activity unleashes the anti-proletarian 
forces in the country, is trying to discredit our Party 
and the proletarian dictatorship, and is thereby facilitating 
the work of the enemies of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 73 
In reply to this, Kamenev (and Zinoviev too) referred 
at first to the Western capitalist press, which, it 
appears, praises our Party, and Stalin too, and later referred 
to the Smena-Vekhist20 Ustryalov, a representative 
of the bourgeois experts in our country, who expresses 
solidarity with the position of our Party. 
As regards the capitalists, there is a great difference 
of opinion among them about our Party. For instance, 
in the American press a little while ago they were praising 
Stalin because, they said, he would give them the 
opportunity of securing big concessions. But now, it 
turns out, they are scolding and abusing Stalin in every 
way, asserting that he has ³deceived² them. A cartoon 
once appeared in the bourgeois press showing Stalin 
with a bucket of water, putting out the fire of revolution. 
But later another cartoon appeared in refutation of the 
first: it showed Stalin this time not with a bucket of 
water, but with a bucket of oil; and it turns out that 
Stalin is not putting out, but adding fuel to the fire of 
revolution. (Applause, laughter.) 
As you see, over there, among the capitalists, there 
is considerable disagreement about the position of 
our Party, as well as about the position of Stalin. 
Let us pass to Ustryalov. Who is Ustryalov? Ustryalov 
is a representative of the bourgeois experts and of 
the new bourgeoisie generally. He is a class enemy of 
the proletariat. That is undeniable. But there are various 
kinds of enemies. There are class enemies who refuse 
to reconcile themselves to the Soviet regime and are 
out to overthrow it at any cost. But there are also class 
enemies who in one way or another have reconciled themselves 
to the Soviet regime. There are enemies who are

J. V. S T A L I N 74 
trying to pave the way for the overthrow of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. These are the Mensheviks, 
Socialist-Revolutionaries, Cadets and the like. But there 
are also enemies who co-operate with the Soviet regime 
and oppose those who stand for its overthrow, hoping 
that the dictatorship will gradually weaken and degenerate, 
and will then meet the interests of the new 
bourgeoisie. Ustryalov belongs to this latter category 
of enemies. 
Why did Kamenev refer to Ustryalov? Maybe in 
order to show that our Party has degenerated, and that 
it is because of this that Ustryalov praises Stalin or our 
Party in general? It was not for that reason, apparently, 
because Kamenev did not venture to say so frankly. 
Why, then, did Kamenev refer to Ustryalov? Evidently, 
in order to hint at ³degeneration.² 
But Kamenev forgot to mention that this same 
Ustryalov praised Lenin even more. Everybody in our 
Party is familiar with Ustryalov¹s articles in praise 
of Lenin. What is the explanation? Can it be that Comrade 
Lenin had ³degenerated² or had begun to ³degenerate,² 
when he introduced NEP? One has only to put 
this question to realise how utterly absurd the assumption 
of ³degeneration² is. 
Well, then, why does Ustryalov praise Lenin and 
our Party, and why do the Mensheviks and Cadets praise 
the opposition? That is the question which has to be answered 
first of all, and which Kamenev does his best 
to evade. 
The Mensheviks and Cadets praise the opposition 
because it undermines the unity of our Party, weakens 
the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thus facilitates

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 75 
the efforts of the Mensheviks and Cadets to overthrow 
the Soviet regime. The quotations prove that. Ustryalov, 
however, praises our Party because the Soviet 
government has permitted NEP, has permitted private 
capital, and has permitted bourgeois experts, whose 
assistance and experience the proletariat needs. 
The Mensheviks and Cadets praise the opposition 
because its factional activity is helping them in the 
work of paving the way for the overthrow of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. But the Ustryalovs, knowing 
that the dictatorship cannot be overthrown, reject the 
idea of overthrowing the Soviet regime, try to secure 
a snug corner under the dictatorship of the proletariat 
and to ingratiate themselves with it‹and they praise 
the Party because it has introduced NEP and, on certain 
conditions, has permitted the existence of the new bourgeoisie, 
which wants to utilise the Soviet regime 
for the furtherance of its own class aims, but which the 
Soviet regime is utilising for the furtherance of the 
aims of the proletarian dictatorship. 
Therein lies the difference between the various 
class enemies of the proletariat of our country. 
Therein lies the root cause why the Mensheviks and 
Cadets praise the opposition, while Messieurs the Ustryalovs 
praise our Party. 
I should like to draw your attention to Lenin¹s 
view on this subject. 
³In our Soviet Republic,² Lenin says, ³the social order is 
based on the collaboration of two classes: the workers and peasants, 
in which the ŒNepmen,¹ i.e., the bourgeoisie, are now permitted 
to participate on certain conditions² (Lenin, Vol. XXVII 
p. 405)

J. V. S T A L I N 76 
Well, it is because the new bourgeoisie is permitted 
a certain qualified collaboration‹on certain conditions, 
of course, and under the control of the Soviet government‹
it is precisely because of this that Ustryalov 
praises our Party, hoping to make a foothold out of this 
permission and to utilise the Soviet regime to further 
the aims of the bourgeoisie. But we, the Party, 
calculate differently: we calculate to utilise the members 
of the new bourgeoisie, their experience and their knowledge, 
with a view to Sovietising, to assimilating, part 
of them, and to casting aside the other part who prove 
incapable of being Sovietised. 
Is it not a fact that Lenin drew a distinction between 
the new bourgeoisie and the Mensheviks and Cadets, 
permitting and utilising the former, and proposing that 
the latter be arrested. 
Here is what Comrade Lenin wrote on this score in 
his work The Tax in Kind: 
³We should not be afraid of Communists Œlearning¹ from 
bourgeois experts, including merchants, small capitalist co-operators, 
and capitalists. We should learn from them in the same 
way as we learnt from the military experts, though in a different 
form. The results of what is Œlearnt¹ must be tested only by 
practical experience: do things better than the bourgeois experts 
at your side; try this way and that to secure an improvement in 
agriculture and industry, and to develop exchange between them. 
Do not grudge the price for Œtuition¹: no price for tuition will be 
too high if only we learn something² (Lenin, Vol. XXVI, p. 352). 
That is what Lenin said of the new bourgeoisie and the 
bourgeois experts, of whom Ustryalov is a representative. 
And here is what Lenin said about the Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries:

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 77 
³But those Œnon-party¹ people who are in fact nothing more or 
less than Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries disguised in 
fashionable, non-party attire, à la Kronstadt, should be carefully 
kept in prison, or packed off to Berlin, to Martov, so that they 
may freely enjoy all the charms of pure democracy and freely exchange 
ideas with Chernov, Milyukov and the Georgian Mensheviks² 
(ibid., p. 352). 
That is what Lenin said. 
Maybe the opposition does not agree with Lenin? 
Then let it say so frankly. 
This explains why we arrest Mensheviks and Cadets 
but permit the new bourgeoisie on certain conditions 
and with certain limitations, in order, while combating 
them with measures of an economic nature and overcoming 
them step by step, to utilise their experience and 
knowledge for our work of economic construction. 
It therefore follows that our Party is praised by 
certain class enemies, like Ustryalov, because we have 
introduced NEP and permitted the bourgeoisie a certain 
qualified and limited collaboration with the existing 
Soviet system, our aim being to utilise the knowledge 
and experience of this bourgeoisie for our constructive 
work, which aim, as you know, we are not unsuccessfully 
achieving. The opposition, on the other hand, is 
praised by other class enemies, like the Mensheviks and 
Cadets, because its activity tends to undermine the 
unity of our Party, to undermine the dictatorship of 
the proletariat, and to facilitate the efforts of the Mensheviks 
and Cadets to overthrow the dictatorship. 
I hope the opposition will at last understand the 
profound difference between praise of the former kind 
and praise of the latter kind.

J. V. S T A L I N 78 
3. There Are Errors and Errors 
The opposition spoke here of certain errors committed 
by individual members of the Central Committee. 
Certain errors, of course, have been committed. Nobody 
in our Party is absolutely ³infallible.² Such people do 
not exist. But there are different kinds of errors. There 
are errors in which their authors do not persist, and 
which do not develop into platforms, trends or factions. 
Such errors are quickly forgotten. But there are errors 
of a different kind, errors in which their authors persist 
and from which develop factions, platforms and struggle 
within the Party. Such errors cannot be quickly forgotten. 
Between these two categories of errors a strict distinction 
must be made. 
Trotsky, for instance, says that at one time I committed 
an error in regard to the foreign trade monopoly. 
That is true. I did indeed propose, at a time when 
our procurement agencies were in a state of chaos, that 
one of our ports should be temporarily opened for the 
export of grain. But I did not persist in my error and, 
after discussing it with Lenin, at once corrected it. I 
could enumerate scores and hundreds of similar errors 
committed by Trotsky, which were later corrected by the 
Central Committee, and which he did not persist in. If I 
were to enumerate all the errors‹very serious ones, 
less serious ones, and not very serious ones‹which 
Trotsky has committed in the course of his work in the 
Central Committee, but which he did not persist in and 
which have been forgotten, I should have to deliver 
several lectures on the subject. But I think that in a

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 79 
political struggle, in a political controversy, it is not such 
errors that should be spoken about, but those which 
later developed into platforms and gave rise to a struggle 
within the Party. 
But Trotsky and Kamenev touched upon precisely 
the kind of errors which did not develop into opposition 
trends and which were quickly forgotten. And since the 
opposition touched upon precisely such questions, permit 
me, in my turn, to recall certain errors of this kind 
which the opposition leaders committed. Perhaps this 
will serve as a lesson to them and they will not try to 
fasten upon already forgotten errors another time. 
There was a time when Trotsky asserted in the 
Central Committee of our Party that the Soviet regime 
hung by a thread, that it had ³sung its swan song,² and 
that it had only a few months, if not weeks, to live. 
That was in 1921. It was a most dangerous error, testifying 
to Trotsky¹s dangerous attitude of mind. But the 
Central Committee ridiculed him on account of it, and 
Trotsky did not persist in his error, it was forgotten. 
There was a time‹it was in 1922‹when Trotsky 
proposed that our industrial plants and trusts should be 
allowed to pledge state property, including fixed capital, 
as security for obtaining credits from private capitalists. 
(Comrade Yaroslavsky: ³That is the road to capitulation.²) 
It probably is. At any rate, it would have 
been the pre-condition for the denationalisation of our 
industrial plants. But the Central Committee rejected 
the plan. Trotsky put up a fight, but later ceased to persist 
in his error, and it is now forgotten. 
There was a time‹it was in 1922‹when Trotsky 
proposed rigorous concentration of our industry, such a

J. V. S T A L I N 80 
crazy concentration that it would infallibly have put 
about a third of our working class outside the gates of 
the mills and factories. The Central Committee rejected 
this proposal of Trotsky¹s as something scholastic, crazy 
and politically dangerous. Trotsky several times intimated 
to the Central Committee that all the same this 
course would sooner or later have to be adopted. However, 
we did not adopt this course. (A voice from the audience: 
³It would have meant closing down the Putilov Works.²) 
Yes, that is what it would have come to. But subsequently 
Trotsky ceased to persist in his error, and it 
was forgotten. 
And so on and so forth. 
Or take Trotsky¹s friends, Zinoviev and Kamenev, 
who are so fond of recalling that there was a time when 
Bukharin said ³enrich yourselves² and who keep 
dancing around this phrase ³enrich yourselves.² 
It was in 1922, when we were discussing the question 
of the Urquhart concession and the enslaving terms of 
this concession. Well then, is it not a fact that Kamenev 
and Zinoviev proposed that we should accept the enslaving 
terms of the Urquhart concession, and persisted 
in their proposal? However, the Central Committee 
turned down the Urquhart concession, Zinoviev and 
Kamenev ceased to persist in their error, and the error 
was forgotten. 
Or take, for example, yet another of Kamenev¹s 
errors, one which I am reluctant to mention, but which 
he compels me to recall because he bores us with his 
continual reminders of Bukharin¹s error, an error which 
Bukharin long ago corrected and finished with. I am 
referring to an incident that happened after the Febru

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 81 
ary Revolution, when Kamenev was in exile in Siberia, 
when Kamenev joined with well-known Siberian merchants 
(in Achinsk) in sending a telegram of greetings 
to the constitutionalist Mikhail Romanov (Shouts: 
³Shame!²), that same Romanov in whose favour the tsar 
abdicated and to whom he transferred the ³right to the 
throne.² That, of course, was a most stupid error, for 
which Kamenev received a severe drubbing from our 
Party at the time of the April Conference in 1917. But 
Kamenev acknowledged his error, and it was forgotten. 
Is there any need to recall errors of this kind? Of 
course not, because they were forgotten and finished 
with long ago. Why then do Trotsky and Kamenev keep 
shoving errors of this kind under the noses of their 
Party opponents? Is it not obvious that by doing 
so they only compel us to recall the numerous errors 
committed by the leaders of the opposition? And we are 
compelled to do so, if only to teach the opposition not 
to indulge in pin-pricks and tittle-tattle. 
But there are errors of a different kind, errors in 
which their authors persist and from which later factional 
platforms develop. These are errors of an entirely different 
order. It is the task of the Party to disclose such 
errors and overcome them. For overcoming such errors 
is the sole means by which to assert the principles 
of Marxism in the Party, to preserve the unity of the 
Party, to eliminate factionalism, and to create a guarantee 
against the repetition of such errors. 
Take, for example, Trotsky¹s error at the time of 
the Brest Peace, an error which developed into a regular 
platform directed against the Party. Is it necessary to 
combat such errors openly and determinedly? Yes, it is.

J. V. S T A L I N 82 
Or take that other error of Trotsky¹s, during the 
trade union discussion, an error which provoked an all- 
Russian discussion in our Party. 
Or, for example, the October error of Zinoviev and 
Kamenev, which created a crisis in the Party on the 
eve of the uprising of October 1917. 
Or, for example, the present errors of the opposition 
bloc, which have evolved into a factional platform 
and a struggle against the Party. 
And so on and so forth. 
Is it necessary to combat such errors openly and 
determinedly? Yes, it is. 
Can we keep silent about such errors, when it is a 
question of disagreements in the Party? Obviously not. 
4. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat 
According to Zinoviev 
Zinoviev referred in his speech to the dictatorship 
of the proletariat, and claimed that Stalin, in his article 
³Concerning Questions of Leninism,² incorrectly explains 
the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
That is nonsense, comrades. Zinoviev is trying to 
blame others for his own sins. The fact of the matter 
is that Zinoviev distorts Lenin¹s concept of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. 
Zinoviev has two versions of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat, neither of which can be called Marxist, 
and which fundamentally contradict each other. 
First version. Proceeding from the correct proposition 
that the Party is the principal directing force in 
the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Zino

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 83 
viev arrives at the absolutely incorrect conclusion that 
the dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the 
Party. In other words, Zinoviev identifies dictatorship 
of the Party with the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
But what does identifying dictatorship of the Party 
with the dictatorship of the proletariat mean? 
It means, firstly, placing the sign of equality between 
class and party, between the whole and a part 
of the whole, which is absurd and preposterous. Lenin 
never identified, and never could have identified, party 
and class. Between the Party and the class there is a 
whole series of non-Party mass organisations of the proletariat, 
and behind them stands the whole mass of the 
proletarian class. To ignore the role and importance 
of these non-Party mass organisations, and still more 
the whole mass of the working class, and to think that 
the Party can replace the non-Party mass organisations 
of the proletariat and the proletarian mass as a 
whole, means divorcing the Party from the masses, carrying 
bureaucratisation of the Party to an extreme 
point, converting the Party into an infallible force, 
and implanting ³Nechayevism,²21 ³Arakcheyevism²22 in 
the Party. 
It goes without saying that Lenin has nothing in 
common with such a ³theory² of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat. 
It means, secondly, understanding dictatorship of 
the Party not in a figurative sense, not in the sense of 
the Party¹s leadership of the working class, which is the 
way Comrade Lenin understood it, but in the strict 
meaning of the word ³dictatorship,² that is, in the sense 
of the Party replacing leadership of the working class

J. V. S T A L I N 84 
by the use of force against it. For what is dictatorship 
in the strict meaning of the word? Dictatorship, in the 
strict meaning of the word, is power based on the use 
of force; for without the element of force there is no 
dictatorship, understood in its strict meaning. Can the 
Party be a power based on the use of force in relation to 
its class, in relation to the majority of the working class? 
Obviously not. Otherwise, it would be a dictatorship 
not over the bourgeoisie, but over the working 
class. 
The Party is the teacher, the guide, the leader of its 
class and not a power based on the use of force 
in relation to the majority of the working class. 
Otherwise, there would be no point in talking about 
the method of persuasion as the proletarian party¹s 
principal method of work in the ranks of the working 
class. Otherwise, there would be no point in saying that 
the Party must convince the broad proletarian masses 
of the correctness of its policy, and that only when it 
performs this task can the Party consider itself a real 
mass party capable of leading the proletariat into battle. 
Otherwise, the Party would have to replace the method 
of persuasion by the method of ordering and threatening 
the proletariat, which is absurd and absolutely incompatible 
with the Marxist conception of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. 
That is the kind of nonsense to which Zinoviev¹s 
³theory² leads, the theory which identifies dictatorship 
(leadership) of the Party with the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. 
It goes without saying that Lenin has nothing in 
common with this ³theory.²

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 85 
It was against this nonsense that I objected when I 
opposed Zinoviev in my article ³Concerning Questions 
of Leninism.² 
It may not be superfluous to state that that article 
was written and sent to the press with the full 
agreement and approval of the leading comrades in our 
Party. 
So much for Zinoviev¹s first version of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. 
And here is the second version. While the first version 
distorts Leninism in one way, the second version 
distorts it in an entirely different way, directly opposite 
to the first. This second version consists in Zinoviev 
defining the dictatorship of the proletariat not as the 
leadership of one class, the proletarian class, but as the 
leadership of two classes, the workers and the peasants. 
Here is what Zinoviev says on this score: 
³The leadership, the helm, the direction of state affairs is 
now in the hands of two classes‹the working class and the peasantry² 
(G. Zinoviev, The Worker-Peasant Alliance and the Red 
Army, Priboy Publishing House, Leningrad 1925, p. 4). 
Can it be denied that what exists now in our country 
is the dictatorship of the proletariat? No, it cannot. 
What does the dictatorship of the proletariat in 
our country consist in? According to Zinoviev, it consists, 
apparently, in the fact that the state affairs of 
our country are administered by two classes. Is this 
compatible with the Marxist conception of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat? Obviously not. 
Lenin says that the dictatorship of the proletariat 
is the rule of one class, the proletarian class. Under

J. V. S T A L I N 86 
the conditions of the alliance of the proletariat and 
the peasantry, this monocracy of the proletariat finds 
expression in the fact that the directing force in this 
alliance is the proletariat, its party, which does not 
and cannot share the direction of state affairs with another 
force or another party. All that is so elementary and 
incontestable as hardly to need explaining. But it follows 
from what Zinoviev says that the dictatorship 
of the proletariat is the leadership of two classes. Why 
then should such a dictatorship not be called the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry, instead of 
the dictatorship of the proletariat? And is it not clear 
that under Zinoviev¹s conception of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat we ought to have the leadership of 
two parties, corresponding to the two classes standing 
at the ³helm of state affairs²? What can there be in 
common between this ³theory² of Zinoviev¹s and 
the Marxist conception of the dictatorship of the proletariat? 
It goes without saying that Lenin has nothing in common 
with this ³theory.² 
Conclusion: Quite obviously, both in the first and 
the second version of his ³theory, ² Zinoviev distorts 
Lenin¹s teaching on the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
5. Trotsky¹s Oracular Sayings 
I should like, further, to dwell on certain ambiguous 
statements made by Trotsky, statements which in 
point of fact were meant to mislead. I wish to mention 
only a few facts.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 87 
One fact. When asked what his attitude was towards 
his Menshevik past, Trotsky struck something of a pose 
and replied: 
³The fact in itself that I joined the Bolshevik Party . . . 
this fact in itself shows that I deposited on the threshold of the 
Party everything that had until then separated me from Bolshevism.² 
What does ³depositing on the threshold of the Party 
everything that separated² Trotsky ³from Bolshevism² 
mean? Remmele was right when he interjected at this 
point: ³How can such things be deposited on the threshold 
of the Party?² And, indeed, how can one deposit such 
refuse on the threshold of the Party? (Laughter.) That 
question was left unanswered by Trotsky. 
Besides, what does Trotsky mean when he says that 
he deposited his Menshevik relics on the threshold of 
the Party? Did he deposit those things on the threshold 
of the Party as a reserve for future battles within the 
Party, or did he simply burn them? It looks as if Trotsky 
deposited them on the threshold of the Party as a 
reserve. For how otherwise can one explain Trotsky¹s 
permanent disagreements with the Party, which began 
a little while after his entry into the Party and which 
have not ceased to this day? 
Judge for yourselves. 1918‹Trotsky¹s disagreements 
with the Party over the Brest Peace, and the struggle 
within the Party. 1920-21‹Trotsky¹s disagreements 
with the Party over the trade-union movement, and the 
all-Russian discussion. 1923‹Trotsky¹s disagreements 
with the Party over fundamental questions of Party 
affairs and economic policy, and the discussion in

J. V. S T A L I N 88 
the Party. 1924‹Trotsky¹s disagreements with the 
Party over the question of the appraisal of the October 
Revolution and over Party leadership, and the discussion 
in the Party. 1925-26‹the disagreements of 
Trotsky and his opposition bloc with the Party over 
fundamental questions of our revolution and current 
policy. 
Are not those too many disagreements for a man 
who had ³deposited on the threshold of the Party everything 
that separated him from Bolshevism²? 
Can it be said that Trotsky¹s permanent disagreements 
with the Party are a ³haphazard happening,² 
and not a systematic phenomenon? 
Hardly. 
What, then, can be the purpose of this more than 
ambiguous statement of Trotsky¹s? 
I think that it had only one purpose: to throw dust 
in the eyes of his hearers and mislead them. 
Another fact. We know that Trotsky¹s ³theory² of 
permanent revolution is a question of no little importance 
from the viewpoint of the ideology of our Party, 
from the viewpoint of the perspectives of our revolution. 
We know that this ³theory² had, and still has, 
pretensions to compete with the Leninist theory of the 
motive forces of our revolution. It is quite natural, 
therefore, that Trotsky has been asked repeatedly what 
his attitude is now, in 1926, to his ³theory² of permanent 
revolution. And what answer did Trotsky give in his 
speech at the Comintern plenum? One that was more 
than equivocal. He said that the ³theory² of permanent 
revolution has certain ³defects,² that certain aspects 
of this ³theory² have not been justified in our revolu

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 89 
tionary practice. It follows that while certain aspects 
of this ³theory² constitute ³defects,² there are other 
aspects of this ³theory² which do not constitute ³defects² 
and should retain their validity. But how can 
certain aspects of the ³theory² of permanent revolution 
be separated from others? Is not the ³theory² of permanent 
revolution an integral system of views? Can the 
³theory² of permanent revolution be regarded as a box, 
two corners of which, say, have rotted, while the other 
two have remained whole and intact? And further, is 
it possible here for Trotsky to confine himself to a simple 
statement about ³defects² in general, which commits 
him to nothing, without stating precisely which ³defects² 
he has in mind, and precisely which aspects of 
the ³theory² of permanent revolution he considers incorrect? 
Trotsky said that the ³theory² of permanent revolution 
has certain ³defects,² but precisely which ³defects² 
he had in mind and precisely which aspects of 
this ³theory² he considered incorrect‹of this he did 
not say a word. Trotsky¹s statement on this subject 
must therefore be regarded as an evasion of the question, 
as an attempt to parry i t with equivocal talk about 
³defects² which commits him to nothing. 
Trotsky behaved in this instance in the way certain 
astute oracles did in olden days, who parried inquirers 
with ambiguous answers like the following: ³When 
crossing a river, a big army will be routed.² Which river 
would be crossed, and whose army would be routed was 
left for the hearers to interpret. (Laughter.)

6. Zinoviev in the Role of a Schoolboy 
Quoting Marx, Engels, Lenin 
I should like, further, to say a few words about 
Zinoviev¹s peculiar manner of quoting the Marxist 
classics. The characteristic feature of this manner of 
Zinoviev¹s is that he mixes up all periods and dates, 
piles them into one heap, severs individual propositions 
and formulas of Marx and Engels from their living 
connection with reality, converts them into worn-out 
dogmas, and thus violates the fundamental precept of 
Marx and Engels that ³Marxism is not a dogma, but 
a guide to action.² 
Here are a few facts: 
1) First fact. Zinoviev quoted in his speech the 
passage from Marx¹s pamphlet, The Class Struggles 
in France (1848-1850), which says that ³the task of the 
worker (meaning the victory of socialism‹J. St.) is 
not accomplished anywhere within national walls.²23 
Zinoviev further quoted the following passage from 
Marx¹s letter to Engels (1858): 
³The difficult question for us is this: on the Continent the 
revolution is imminent and will also immediately assume a socialist 
character. Is it not bound to be crushed in this little corner, 
considering that in a far greater territory the movement of 
bourgeois society is still on the upgrade?²* (See K. Marx and 
F. Engels, Letters, pp. 74-75.24) 
Zinoviev quotes these passages from Marx relating 
to the period of the forties and fifties of the last century 
and arrives at the conclusion that, by virtue of this, the 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 91 
question of the victory of socialism in individual countries 
has been answered in the negative for all times 
and periods of capitalism. 
Can it be said that Zinoviev has understood Marx, 
his standpoint, his basic line, on this question of the 
victory of socialism in individual countries? No, it 
cannot. On the contrary, it is apparent from these quotations 
that Zinoviev has completely misunderstood Marx 
and distorted Marx¹s basic standpoint. 
Does it follow from these quotations from Marx 
that the victory of socialism in individual countries 
is impossible under any conditions of capitalist development? 
No, it does not. All that follows from Marx¹s 
words is that the victory of socialism in individual 
countries is impossible only if ³the movement of bourgeois 
society is still on the upgrade.² But if the 
movement of bourgeois society as a whole, by virtue 
of the course of things, changes its direction and begins 
to be on the downgrade‹what then? It follows from 
Marx¹s words that in such conditions the basis for 
denying the possibility of the victory of socialism in 
individual countries disappears. 
Zinoviev forgets that these quotations from Marx 
relate to the period of pre-monopoly capitalism, when 
the development of capitalism as a whole was on the 
upgrade, when the growth of capitalism as a whole 
was not accompanied by a process of decay in such a 
capitalistically developed country as Britain, when 
the law of uneven development did not yet, and could 
not yet, represent such a mighty factor in the disintegration 
of capitalism as it came to be later, in the period 
of monopoly capitalism, the period of imperialism.

J. V. S T A L I N 92 
For the period of pre-monopoly capitalism, Marx¹s 
statement that the basic task of the working class 
cannot be accomplished in individual countries is 
absolutely correct. As I already said in my report at the 
Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.), in the old 
days, in the period of pre-monopoly capitalism, the 
question whether the victory of socialism was possible 
in individual countries was answered in the negative, 
and quite correctly. But now, in the present period 
of capitalism, when pre-monopoly capitalism has passed 
into imperialist capitalism‹can it be said now that the 
development of capitalism as a whole is on the upgrade? 
No, it cannot. Lenin¹s analysis of the economic 
essence of imperialism says that in the period of imperialism 
bourgeois society as a whole is on the downgrade. 
Lenin is quite right in saying that monopoly capitalism, 
imperialist capitalism, is moribund capitalism. Here 
is what Comrade Lenin says on this score: 
³It is clear why imperialism is moribund capitalism, capitalism 
in transition to socialism: monopoly, which grows out of 
capitalism, is already capitalism dying out, the beginning of its 
transition to socialism. The tremendous socialisation of labour by 
imperialism (what the apologists‹the bourgeois economists‹call 
Œinterlocking¹) means the same thing² (see Lenin, Vol . XIX, 
p. 302). 
Pre-monopoly capitalism, whose development as 
a whole was on the upgrade, is one thing. Imperialist 
capitalism is another thing, when the world has 
already been divided up among capitalist groups, when 
the spasmodic character of capitalist development demands 
new redivisions of the already divided world 
through military clashes, when the conflicts and wars

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 93 
between imperialist groups springing from this soil 
weaken the capitalist world front, render it easily vulnerable 
and create the possibility of a breach of this 
front in individual countries. In the former case, under 
pre-monopoly capitalism, the victory of socialism in 
individual countries is impossible. In the latter case, 
in the period of imperialism, in the period of moribund 
capitalism, the victory of socialism in individual countries 
has now become possible. 
That is the point, comrades, and that is what 
Zinoviev refuses to understand. 
You see that Zinoviev quotes Marx like a schoolboy, 
ignoring Marx¹s standpoint and seizing upon individual 
quotations from Marx, which he applies not as a Marxist, 
but as a Social-Democrat. 
What does the revisionist manner of quoting Marx 
consist in? The revisionist manner of quoting Marx 
consists in replacing Marx¹s standpoint by quotations 
from individual propositions of Marx, taken out of 
connection with the concrete conditions of a specific 
epoch. 
What does the Zinoviev manner of quoting Marx 
consist in? The Zinoviev manner of quoting Marx 
consists in replacing Marx¹s standpoint by the letter 
of the text, by quotations from Marx, severed from 
their living connection with the conditions of development 
of the eighteen-fifties and converted into a 
dogma. 
Comment, I think, is superfluous. 
2) Second fact. Zinoviev quotes the words of Engels 
from ³The Principles of Communism²25 (1847) to the effect 
that the workers¹ revolution ³cannot take place in one

J. V. S T A L I N 94 
country alone,² compares these words of Engels¹ with 
my statement at the Fifteenth Conference of the 
C.P.S.U.(B.) to the effect that we had already fulfilled 
nine-tenths of the twelve requirements enumerated by 
Engels, and from this draws two conclusions: firstly, 
that the victory of socialism in individual countries is 
impossible, and, secondly, that in my statement I had 
painted too rosy a picture of present-day conditions in 
the U.S.S.R. 
As to the quotations from Engels, it must be said 
that Zinoviev here commits the same error in interpreting 
quotations as he did in the case of Marx. Clearly, 
in the period of pre-monopoly capitalism, in the period 
when the development of bourgeois society as a whole 
was on the upgrade, Engels had to give a negative 
answer to the question of the possibility of the victory 
of socialism in individual countries. Mechanically to 
extend Engels¹ proposition, made in reference to the 
old period of capitalism, to the new period of capitalism, 
the imperialist period, is to distort the standpoint 
of Engels and Marx for the sake of the letter, for the 
sake of an isolated quotation taken out of connection 
with the actual conditions of development in the period 
of pre-monopoly capitalism. As I already said in 
my report at the Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.), 
in its time this formula of Engels¹ was the only correct 
one. But, after all, it should be realised that one cannot 
put on a par the period of the forties of the last century, 
when there could be no question of moribund capitalism, 
and the present period of capitalist development, the 
period of imperialism, when capitalism as a whole is 
moribund capitalism. Is it so difficult to understand

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 95 
that what was then considered impossible has now, 
under the new conditions of capitalism, become possible 
and necessary? 
You see that here too, in relation to Engels, as in 
relation to Marx, Zinoviev has remained true to his 
revisionist manner of quoting the Marxist classics. 
As to Zinoviev¹s second conclusion, he has directly 
distorted what Engels said about his 12 requirements, 
or measures, for the workers¹ revolution. Zinoviev tries 
to make out that Engels in his 12 requirements gives 
a comprehensive programme of socialism, right down 
to the abolition of classes, the abolition of commodity 
production and, hence, the abolition of the state. That 
is quite untrue. It is a complete distortion of Engels. 
There is not a single word in Engels¹ 12 requirements 
either about the abolition of classes, or about the abolition 
of commodity economy, or about the abolition 
of the state, or about the abolition of all forms of private 
property. On the contrary, Engels¹ 12 requirements 
presume the existence of ³democracy² (by ³democracy² 
Engels at that time meant the dictatorship 
of the proletariat), the existence of classes and the 
existence of commodity economy. Engels explicitly 
says that his 12 requirements envisage a direct ³assault 
on private property² (and not its complete abolition) 
and ³ensuring the existence of the proletariat² (and not 
the abolition of the proletariat as a class). Here are 
Engels¹ words: 
³The proletarian revolution, which in al l probability is 
coming, will only gradually remodel present society, and only 
after that can it abolish private property, when the necessary quatity 
of means of production has been created. . . . First of all it

J. V. S T A L I N 96 
will establish a democratic system and thereby, directly or indirectly, 
the political rule of the proletariat. . . . Democracy would 
be quite useless to the proletariat if it were not used forthwith as 
a means of carrying out further measures for launching a direct 
assault on private property and safeguarding the existence of the 
proletariat.* The chief of these measures, which already necessarily 
follow from the existing conditions, are as follows. . . .² 
And then comes the enumeration of the 12 requirements 
or measures referred to (see Engels, ³The 
Principles of Communism²). 
You thus see that what Engels had in mind was not 
a comprehensive programme of socialism, envisaging 
the abolition of classes, the state, commodity production, 
etc., but the first steps of the socialist revolution, the 
first measures necessary for a direct assault on private 
property, for ensuring the existence of the working 
class, and for consolidating the political rule of the 
proletariat. 
There is only one conclusion: Zinoviev distorted 
Engels when he interpreted the latter¹s 12 requirements 
as a comprehensive programme of socialism. 
What did I say in my reply to the discussion at 
the Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.)? I said 
that in our country, the U.S.S.R., nine-tenths of 
Engels¹ requirements, or measures, representing the 
first steps of the socialist revolution, had already 
been realised. 
Does this mean that we have already realised 
socialism? 
Quite clearly, it does not. 
* All italics mine.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 97 
Hence, true to his manner of quoting, Zinoviev performed 
a ³slight² piece of juggling with my statement 
at the Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
That is what Zinoviev¹s specific manner of quoting 
Marx and Engels leads him to. 
Zinoviev¹s manner of quoting reminds me of a rather 
amusing anecdote about the Social-Democrats which 
was related by a Swedish revolutionary syndicalist 
in Stockholm. It was in 1906, at the time of the Stockholm 
Congress of our Party. This Swedish comrade in 
his story hit off very amusingly the pedantic manner 
in which some Social-Democrats quote Marx and Engels, 
and listening to him, we, the congress delegates, split 
our sides with laughter. This is the anecdote. It was at 
the time of the sailors¹ and soldiers¹ revolt in the Crimea. 
Representatives of the navy and army came to the Social- 
Democrats and said: ³For some years past you have 
been calling on us to revolt against tsarism. Well, we 
are now convinced that you are right, and we sailors 
and soldiershave made up our mints to revolt and now 
we have come to you for advice.² The Social-Democrats 
became flurried and replied that they couldn¹t 
decide the question of a revolt without a special conference. 
The sailors intimated that there was no time to 
lose, that everything was ready, and that if they did 
not get a straight answer from the Social-Democrats, 
and if the Social-Democrats did not take over the direction 
of the revolt, the whole thing might collapse. The 
sailors and soldiers went away pending instructions, 
and the Social-Democrats called a conference to discuss 
the matter. They took the first volume of Capital, they 
took the second volume of Capital, and then they took

J. V. S T A L I N 98 
the third volume of Capital, looking for some instruction 
about the Crimea, about Sevastopol, about a revolt 
in the Crimea. But they could not find a single, literally 
not a single instruction in all three volumes of 
Capital either about Sevastopol, or about the Crimea, 
or about a sailors¹ and soldiers¹ revolt. (Laughter.) They 
turned over the pages of other works of Marx and Engels, 
looking for instructions‹but not a single instruction 
could they find. (Laughter..) What was to be done? 
Meanwhile the sailors had come expecting an answer. 
Well, the Social-Democrats had to confess that under 
the circumstances they were unable to give the sailors 
and soldiers any instructions. ³And so,² our Swedish 
comrade ended, ³the sailors¹ and soldiers¹ revolt collapsed.² 
(Laughter.) 
Undoubtedly, there is a good deal of exaggeration 
in this story. But undoubtedly, too, it lays its finger 
very neatly on the basic trouble with Zinoviev¹s manner 
of quoting Marx and Engels. 
3) Third fact. The matter concerns quotations from 
Lenin¹s works. To what pains did Zinoviev not go to 
scrape together a pile of quotations from the works of 
Lenin and to ³stagger² his hearers. Zinoviev evidently 
thinks that the more quotations the better, without 
caring very much what the quotations say and what 
inferences are to be drawn from them. Yet if you examine 
these quotations, you will easily find that 
Zinoviev did not quote a single passage from Lenin¹s 
works which speaks, even by implication, in favour 
of the present capitulatory attitude of the opposition 
bloc. It should be remarked that for some reason 
Zinoviev did not quote one of the basic passages

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 99 
of Lenin to the effect that the solution of the ³economic 
problem² of the dictatorship, the victory of the proletariat 
of the U.S.S.R. in solving this problem, should 
be considered assured. 
Zinoviev quoted a passage from Lenin¹s pamphlet, 
On Co-operation, which says that in the U.S.S.R. there 
is all that is necessary and sufficient for building a complete 
socialist society. But he did not even try to make 
the slightest effort to indicate, if only by implication, 
what conclusion is to be drawn from this passage, and 
in whose favour it speaks: in favour of the opposition 
bloc, or in favour of the C.P.S.U.(B.). 
Zinoviev endeavoured to prove that the victory of 
socialist construction in our country is impossible, 
but in proof of this proposition he quoted passages from 
Lenin¹s works which knock the bottom out of his assertion. 
Here, for example, is one of these passages: 
³I have had occasion more than once to say that, compared 
with the advanced countries, it was easier for the Russians to 
begin the great proletarian revolution, but that it will be more 
difficult for them to continue it and carry it to a victorious finish, 
in the sense of the complete organisation of a socialist society²* 
(see Lenin, Vol. XXIV, p. 250). 
It did not even occur to Zinoviev that this passage 
speaks in favour of the Party, not of the opposition 
bloc, for it speaks not of the impossibility of building 
socialism in the U.S.S.R., but of the difficulty of building 
i t , the possibility of building socialism in the 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 100 
U.S.S.R. being recognised in this passage as something 
self-understood. The Party always said that it would 
be easier to begin the revolution in the U.S.S.R. than 
in the West-European capitalist countries, but that to 
build socialism would be harder. Does this mean that 
recognition of this fact is equivalent to a denial of the 
possibility of building socialism in the U.S.S.R.? Of 
course not. On the contrary, the only conclusion that 
follows from this fact is that the building of socialism 
in the U.S.S.R. is fully possible and necessary, in spite 
of the difficulties. 
The question arises: Why did Zinoviev need quotations 
like these? 
Evidently, in order to ³stagger² his hearers with 
a pile of quotations, and to muddy the water. (Laughter.) 
But it is now clear, I think, that Zinoviev did not 
achieve his purpose, that his more than comic manner 
of quoting the Marxist classics has tripped him up in 
the most unequivocal fashion. 
7. Revisionism According to Zinoviev 
Lastly, a few words on Zinoviev¹s interpretation 
of the concept ³revisionism.² According to Zinoviev, 
any improvement, any refinement of old formulas or 
individual propositions of Marx or Engels, and still 
more their replacement by other formulas corresponding 
to new conditions, is revisionism. Why, one asks? 
Is not Marxism a science, and does not science develop, 
becoming enriched by new experience and improving 
old formulas? The reason, it appears, is that ³revision² 
means ³reconsidering,² and old formulas cannot be

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 101 
improved or made more precise without to some extent 
reconsidering them, and, consequently, every refinement 
and improvement of old formulas, every enrichment 
of Marxism by new experience and new formulas 
is revisionism. All this, of course, is comical. But what 
can you do with Zinoviev, when he puts himself in a 
comical position and at the same time imagines he is 
fighting revisionism? 
For example, did Stalin have the right to alter 
and make more precise his own formula concerning 
the victory of socialism in one country (1924) in 
full conformity with the directives and basic line 
of Leninism? According to Zinoviev, he had no such 
right. Why? Because altering and making more precise 
an old formula means reconsidering the formula, 
and in German reconsideration means revision. Is it 
not then clear that Stalin is guilty of revisionism? 
It thus follows that we have a new, Zinoviev criterion 
of revisionism, one which dooms Marxist thought 
to complete stagnation for fear of being accused of 
revisionism. 
If, for example, in the middle of the last century 
Marx said that when capitalism was on the upgrade 
the victory of socialism within national boundaries 
was impossible, and Lenin in the fifteenth year of the 
twentieth century said that when the development of 
capitalism was on the downgrade, when capitalism was 
moribund, such a victory was possible, it follows that 
Lenin was guilty of revisionism in relation to Marx. 
If, for example, in the middle of the last century 
Marx said that a socialist ³revolution in the economic 
relations of any country of the European continent, or

J. V. S T A L I N 102 
of the whole European continent, but without England, 
would be a storm in a teacup,²26 and Engels, 
in view of the new experience of the class struggle, later 
altered this proposition and said of the socialist revolution 
that ³the Frenchman will begin it and the 
German will finish it,² i t follows that Engels was 
guilty of revisionism in relation to Marx. 
If Engels said that the Frenchman would begin the 
socialist revolution and the German would finish it, and 
Lenin, in view of the experience of the victory of the revolution 
in the U.S.S.R., changed this formula and 
replaced it by another saying that the Russian began 
the socialist revolution and the German, Frenchman 
and Englishman would finish it, it follows that Lenin 
was guilty of revisionism in relation to Engels, and 
even more so in relation to Marx. 
Here, for example, is what Lenin said on this score: 
³The great founders of socialism, Marx and Engels, having 
watched the development of the labour movement and the growth 
of the world socialist revolution for a number of decades, clearly 
saw that the transition from capitalism to socialism would require 
prolonged birth-pangs, a long period of proletarian dictatorship, 
the break-up of all that belonged to the past, the ruthless destruction 
of all forms of capitalism, the co-operation of the workers 
of all countries, who would have to combine their efforts to ensure 
complete victory. And they said that at the end of the nineteenth 
century Œthe Frenchman will begin it, and the German will finish 
it¹‹the Frenchman would begin it, because in the course of decades 
of revolution he had acquired that intrepid initiative in revolutionary 
action that made him the vanguard of the socialist revolution. 
³Today we see a different combination of forces of international 
socialism. We say that it is easier for the movement to 
begin in countries that do not belong to the category of exploit

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 103 
ing countries, which have better opportunities for robbing and 
are able to bribe the upper stratum of their workers. . . . Things 
have turned out differently from what Marx and Engels expected.* 
They have assigned us, the Russian toiling and exploited classes, 
the honourable role of being the vanguard of the international 
socialist revolution, and we can now see clearly how far the development 
of the revolution will go. The Russian began it‹the 
German, the Frenchman and the Englishman will finish it, and 
socialism will triumph² (see Lenin, Vol. XXII, p. 218). 
You see that Lenin here directly ³reconsiders² 
Engels and Marx and, according to Zinoviev, is guilty 
of ³revisionism.² 
If, for example, Engels and Marx defined the Paris 
Commune as a dictatorship of the proletariat, which, 
as we know, was led by two parties, neither of 
which was a Marxist party, and Lenin, in view of the 
new experience of the class struggle under the conditions 
of imperialism, later said that any developed 
dictatorship of the proletariat could be realised only 
under the leadership of one party, the Marxist party, it 
follows that Lenin was obviously guilty of ³revisionism² 
in relation to Marx and Engels. 
If, in the period prior to the imperialist war, Lenin 
said that federation was an unsuitable type of state 
structure, and in 1917, in view of the new experience 
of the proletarian struggle, he altered, reconsidered, 
this formula and said that federation was the appropriate 
type of state structure during the transition to socialism, 
it follows that Lenin was guilty of ³revisionism² 
in relation to himself and Leninism. 
And so on and so forth. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 104 
It thus follows from what Zinoviev says that Marxism 
must not enrich itself by new experience, and 
that any improvement of individual propositions and 
formulas of any of the Marxist classics is revisionism.
What is Marxism? Marxism is a science. Can Marxism 
persist and develop as a science if it is not enriched 
by the new experience of the class struggle of the proletariat, 
if it does not digest this experience from the 
standpoint of Marxism, from the point of view of the 
Marxist method? Clearly, it cannot. 
After this, is it not obvious that Marxism requires 
that old formulas should be improved and enriched in 
conformity with new experience, while retaining the 
standpoint of Marxism and its method, but that Zinoviev 
does the opposite, retaining the letter and substituting 
the letter of individual Marxist propositions for 
the Marxist standpoint and method? 
What can there be in common between real Marxism 
and the practice of replacing the basic line of 
Marxism by the letter of individual formulas and quotations 
from individual propositions of Marxism? 
Can there be any doubt that this is not Marxism, 
but a travesty of Marxism? 
I t was ³Marxists² like Zinoviev that Marx and 
Engels had in mind when they said: ³Our theory is not 
a dogma, but a guide to action.² 
Zinoviev¹s trouble is that he does not understand 
the meaning and importance of those words of Marx 
and Engels.

THE QUESTION OF THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM 
IN INDIVIDUAL CAPITALIST COUNTRIES 
I have spoken of various errors of the opposition 
and of inaccuracies of fact observed in the speeches of 
the opposition leaders. I have tried to exhaust this subject 
in the form of miscellaneous remarks in the first 
part of my speech in reply to the discussion. Permit 
me now to pass directly to the substance of the matter. 
1. The Prerequisites for Proletarian Revolutions 
in Individual Countries in the Period 
of Imperialism 
The first question is whether the victory of socialism 
is possible in individual capitalist countries in the 
period of imperialism. As you see, it is not a question 
of any one particular country, but of all more or less 
developed imperialist countries. 
What is the fundamental error of the opposition in 
the question of the victory of socialism in individual 
capitalist countries? 
The fundamental error of the opposition is that 
it does not, or will not, understand the vast difference 
between pre-imperialist capitalism and imperialist capitalism, 
that it does not understand the economic 
essence of imperialism and confuses two different phases 
of capitalism‹the pre-imperialist phase and the imperialist 
phase. 
From this error springs another error of the opposition, 
which is that it does not understand the meaning

J. V. S T A L I N 106 
and importance of the law of uneven development in 
the period of imperialism, counterposes to it a levelling 
tendency, and thus slides into the Kautskyan position 
of ultra-imperialism. 
These two errors of the opposition lead to a third, 
which is that it mechanically extends the formulas and 
propositions derived from pre-imperialist capitalism 
to imperialist capitalism, and it is this which leads it 
to deny the possibility of the victory of socialism in 
individual capitalist countries. 
What is the difference between the old, premonopoly 
capitalism and the new, monopoly capitalism, 
if this difference is defined in a couple of words? 
It is that the development of capitalism through 
free competition has been replaced by development 
through huge monopolist capitalist combines; that the 
old, ³cultured,² ³progressive² capital has been replaced 
by finance capital, ³decaying² capital; that the ³peaceful² 
expansion of capital and its spread to ³vacant² 
territories has been replaced by spasmodic development, 
development through redivisions of the already divided 
world by means of military conflicts between 
capitalist groups; that the old capitalism, the development 
of which as a whole was on the upgrade, has 
thus been replaced by moribund capitalism, the development 
of which as a whole is on the downgrade. 
Here is what Lenin says on this score: 
³Let us recall what caused the change from the former Œpeaceful¹ 
epoch of capitalism to the present imperialist epoch: free 
competition gave way to monopolist capitalist combines and the 
whole terrestrial globe was divided up. It is obvious that both 
these facts (and factors) are really of world-wide significance:

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 107 
free trade and peaceful competition were possible and necessary as 
long as capital was in a position to enlarge its colonies without 
hindrance, and to seize unoccupied land in Africa, etc., while the 
concentration of capital was still slight and no monopolist undertakings, 
i.e., undertakings of such a magnitude as to dominate a 
whole branch of industry, existed. The appearance and growth of 
such monopolist undertakings . . . make the free competition of 
former times impossible, they have cut the ground from under 
its feet, while the division of the globe compels the capitalists to 
pass from peaceful expansion to armed struggle for the redivision 
of colonies and spheres of influence² (see Vol. XVIII, p. 254). 
And further: 
³It is impossible to live in the old way, in the comparatively 
tranquil, cultured, peaceful surroundings of a capitalism that 
is smoothly evolving* and gradually spreading to new countries, 
for a new epoch has been ushered in. Finance capital is ousting 
and will completely oust a particular country from the ranks of the 
Great Powers, will deprive it of its colonies and spheres of influence² 
(see Vol. XVIII, pp. 256-57) 
From this follows Lenin¹s main conclusion concerning 
the character of imperialist capitalism: 
³It is clear why imperialism is moribund capitalism, capitalism 
in transition to socialism: monopoly, which grows out of 
capitalism, is already capitalism dying out, the beginning of its 
transition to socialism. The tremendous socialisation of labour by 
imperialism (what the apologists‹the bourgeois economists‹call 
Œinterlocking¹) means the same thing² (see Vol. XIX, p. 302). 
It is the misfortune of our opposition that it does 
not understand the extreme importance of this difference 
between pre-imperialist capitalism and imperialist 
capitalism. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 108 
Hence the starting point for the position of our 
Party is the recognition of the fact that present-day 
capitalism, imperialist capitalism, is moribund capitalism. 
This, unfortunately, does not mean that capitalism 
is already extinct. But it undoubtedly does mean that 
capitalism as a whole is moving towards extinction, and 
not regeneration, that the development of capitalism 
as a whole is on the down grade, not the upgrade. 
From this general question follows the question of 
uneven development in the period of imperialism. 
What do Leninists mean, as a rule, when they speak 
of uneven development in the period of imperialism? 
Do they mean that there is a big difference in the 
levels of development of the various capitalist countries, 
that some lag behind others in their development, 
and that this difference is becoming wider and wider? 
No, they do not mean that. To confuse unevenness of 
development under imperialism with the difference in the 
levels of development of the capitalist countries is to 
be guilty of philistinism. It was precisely this philistinism 
that the opposition was guilty of at the Fifteenth 
Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.) when they confused 
unevenness of development with the difference in economic 
levels of the various capitalist countries. It was precisely 
by starting out from this confusion that the opposition 
at that time arrived at the absolutely incorrect 
conclusion that the unevenness of development was 
formerly greater than it is now, under imperialism. 
It was precisely because of this that Trotsky said at the 
Fifteenth Conference that ³this unevenness was greater 
in the nineteenth century than in the twentieth² (see

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 109 
Trotsky¹s speech at the Fifteenth Conference of the 
C.P.S.U.). Zinoviev at that time said the same thing, 
asserting that it was ³untrue that the unevenness of 
capitalist development was less before the beginning 
of the imperialist epoch² (see Zinoviev¹s speech at the 
Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.). 
It is true that now, after the discussion at the Fifteenth 
Conference, the opposition has found it necessary 
to make a change of front, and in its speeches at the 
Enlarged Plenum of the E.C.C.I. has said something that 
is the very opposite, or has simply tried to pass over 
this error of its in silence. Here, for instance, is what 
Trotsky said in his speech at the Enlarged Plenum: ³As 
to the tempo of development, imperialism has infinitely 
accentuated this unevenness.² As for Zinoviev, he 
deemed it wise in his speech at the E.C.C.I. plenum 
simply to keep silent on this question, although he must 
have known that the dispute was precisely whether the 
action of the law of unevenness becomes stronger or weaker 
in the period of imperialism. But this only shows 
that the discussion taught the opposition a thing or two 
and was not without benefit to it. 
And so: the unevenness of development of the capitalist 
countries in the period of imperialism must not be 
confused with the difference in economic levels of the 
various capitalist countries. 
Can it be said that the diminishing difference in the 
levels of development of the capitalist countries and the 
increased levelling of these countries weaken the action 
of the law of uneven development under imperialism? 
No, it cannot. Does the difference in the levels of development 
increase or diminish? It undoubtedly diminishes.

J. V. S T A L I N 110 
Does the degree of levelling grow or decline? It certainly 
grows. Is there not a contradiction between the growth 
of levelling and increasing unevenness of development 
under imperialism? No, there is not. On the contrary, 
levelling is the background and the basis which make 
the increasing unevenness of development under imperialism 
possible. Only people who, like our oppositionists, 
do not understand the economic essence of imperialism 
can counterpose levelling to the law of uneven 
development under imperialism. It is precisely because 
the lagging countries accelerate their development and 
tend to become level with the foremost countries that the 
struggle between countries to outstrip one another becomes 
more acute; it is precisely this that creates the possibility 
for some countries to outstrip others and oust them 
from the markets, thereby creating the pre-conditions for 
military conflicts, for the weakening of the capitalist 
world front and for the breaching of this front by the 
proletarians of different capitalist countries. He who does 
not understand this simple matter, understands nothing 
about the economic essence of monopoly capitalism. 
And so: levelling is one of the conditions for the increasing 
unevenness of development in the period of imperialism. 
Can it be said that the unevenness of development 
under imperialism consists in the fact that some countries 
overtake and then outstrip others economically in the 
ordinary way, in an evolutionary way, so to speak, without 
spasmodic leaps, without catastrophic wars, and 
without redivisions of the already divided world? No, 
it cannot. This kind of unevenness also existed in the 
period of pre-monopoly capitalism; Marx knew about it,

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 111 
and Lenin wrote about it in his Development of Capitalism 
in Russia.27 At that time the development of capitalism 
proceeded more or less smoothly, more or less in 
an evolutionary way, and some countries outstripped 
others over a long period of time, without spasmodic 
leaps, and without the necessary accompaniment of military 
conflicts on a world scale. It is not this unevenness 
we are speaking of now. 
What, then, is the law of the uneven development of 
capitalist countries under imperialism? 
The law of uneven development in the period of imperialism 
means the spasmodic development of some countries 
relative to others, the rapid ousting from the 
world market of some countries by others, periodic redivisions 
of the already divided world through military 
conflicts and catastrophic wars, the increasing profundity 
and acuteness of the conflicts in the imperialist 
camp, the weakening of the capitalist world front, the 
possibility of this front being breached by the proletariat 
of individual countries, and the possibility of the 
victory of socialism in individual countries. 
What are the basic elements of the law of uneven development 
under imperialism? 
Firstly, the fact that the world is already divided 
up among imperialist groups, that there are no more 
³vacant,² unoccupied territories in the world, and that 
in order to occupy new markets and sources of raw materials, 
in order to expand, it is necessary to seize territory 
from others by force. 
Secondly, the fact that the unprecedented development 
of technology and the increasing levelling of 
development of the capitalist countries have made

J. V. S T A L I N 112 
possible and facilitated the spasmodic outstripping of 
some countries by others, the ousting of more powerful 
countries by less powerful but rapidly developing 
countries. 
Thirdly, the fact that the old distribution of spheres 
of influence among the various imperialist groups is 
forever coming into conflict with the new correlation of 
forces in the world market, and that, in order to establish 
³equilibrium² between the old distribution of spheres 
of influence and the new correlation of forces, periodic 
redivisions of the world by means of imperialist wars 
are necessary. 
Hence the growing intensity and acuteness of the 
unevenness of development in the period of imperialism. 
Hence the impossibility of resolving the conflicts in 
the imperialist camp by peaceful means. 
Hence the untenability of Kautsky¹s theory of ultraimperialism, 
which preaches the possibility of a peaceful 
settlement of these conflicts. 
But it follows from this that, in denying that the 
unevenness of development becomes more intense and 
acute in the period of imperialism, the opposition 
slides into the position of ultra-imperialism. 
Such are the characteristic features of the unevenness 
of development in the period of imperialism. 
When was the division of the world among the 
imperialist groups completed? 
Lenin said that the division of the world was completed 
in the beginning of the twentieth century. 
When in point of fact was the question of a redivision 
of the already divided world first raised? 
At the time of the first world imperialist war.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 113 
But it follows from this that the law of uneven development 
under imperialism could only be discovered and 
substantiated in the beginning of the twentieth century. 
I spoke about that in my report at the Fifteenth 
Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.), when I said that the law 
of uneven development under imperialism was discovered 
and substantiated by Comrade Lenin. 
The world imperialist war was the first attempt to 
redivide the already divided world. That attempt cost 
capitalism the victory of the revolution in Russia and 
the undermining of the foundations of imperialism in 
the colonies and dependencies. 
It goes without saying that the first attempt at redivision 
is bound to be followed by a second attempt, 
preparations for which are already under way in the 
imperialist camp. 
It is scarcely to be doubted that a second attempt at 
redivision will cost world capitalism much dearer than 
the first. 
Such are the perspectives of development of world 
capitalism from the standpoint of the law of uneven development 
under the conditions of imperialism. 
You see that these perspectives point directly and 
immediately to the possibility of the victory of socialism 
in individual capitalist countries in the period of 
imperialism. 
We know that Lenin deduced the possibility of the 
victory of socialism in individual countries directly and 
immediately from the law of uneven development of the 
capitalist countries. And Lenin was absolutely right. For 
the law of uneven development under imperialism completely 
destroys the basis for ³theoretical² exercises on

J. V. S T A L I N 114 
the part of all Social-Democrats concerning the impossibility 
of the victory of socialism in individual capitalist 
countries. 
Here is what Lenin said on this score in his programmatic 
article written in 1915: 
³Uneven economic and political development is an absolute 
law of capitalism. Hence* the victory of socialism is possible 
first in several or even in one capitalist country taken separately² 
(see Vol. XVIII, p. 232). 
Conclusions: 
a) The fundamental error of the opposition consists 
in the fact that it does not see the difference between 
the two phases of capitalism, or avoids stressing this difference. 
And why does it avoid doing so? Because this 
difference leads to the law of uneven development in the 
period of imperialism. 
b) The second error of the opposition is that it does not 
understand, or underestimates, the decisive significance of 
the law of uneven development of the capitalist countries 
under imperialism. And why does it underestimate it? 
Because a correct appraisal of the law of uneven development 
of the capitalist countries leads to the conclusion 
that the victory of socialism in individual countries is 
possible. 
c) Hence the third error of the opposition, which consists 
in denying the possibility of the victory of socialism 
in individual capitalist countries under imperialism.
Whoever denies the possibility of the victory of socialism 
in individual countries is obliged to keep silent 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 115 
about the significance of the law of uneven development 
under imperialism. And whoever is obliged to keep silent 
about the significance of the law of uneven development 
cannot but gloss over the difference between pre-imperialist 
capitalism and imperialist capitalism. 
That is how matters stand with the question of the 
pre-conditions for proletarian revolutions in the capitalist 
countries. 
What is the significance of this question in practice? 
In practice, we are confronted by two lines. 
One line is the line of our Party, which calls upon 
the proletarians of the individual countries to prepare 
for the coming revolution, to follow vigilantly the 
course of events and to be ready, when the conditions are 
favourable, to breach the capitalist front independently, 
to take power and shake the foundations of world 
capitalism. 
The other line is the line of our opposition, which sows 
doubts regarding the expediency of independently breaching 
the capitalist front and calls on the proletarians 
of the individual countries to wait for the ³general 
denouement.² 
Whereas the line of our Party is one of intensifying 
the revolutionary onslaught on one¹s own bourgeoisie 
and giving free rein to the initiative of the proletarians 
of the individual countries, the line of our opposition is 
one of passive waiting and of fettering the initiative 
of the proletarians of the individual countries in their 
struggle against their own bourgeoisies. 
The first line is one of activising the proletarians of 
the individual countries.

J. V. S T A L I N 116 
The second line is one of sapping the proletariat¹s will 
for revolution, the line of passivity and waiting. 
Lenin was a thousand times right when he wrote the 
following prophetic words, which have a direct bearing 
on our present disputes: 
³I know that there are, of course, sages who think they are 
very clever and even call themselves Socialists, who assert that 
power should not have been seized until the revolution had broken 
out in all countries. They do not suspect that by speaking in this 
way they are deserting the revolution and going over to the 
side of the bourgeoisie. To wait until the toiling classes bring 
about a revolution on an international scale means that everybody 
should stand stock-still in expectation. That is nonsense² (see 
Vol. XXIII, p. 9). 
These words of Lenin should not be forgotten. 
2. How Zinoviev ³Elaborates² Lenin 
I have spoken of the pre-conditions for proletarian 
revolutions in individual capitalist countries. I should 
now like to say a few words to show how Zinoviev distorts 
or ³elaborates² Lenin¹s fundamental article on the preconditions 
for proletarian revolutions and on the victory 
of socialism in individual capitalist countries. I have 
in mind Lenin¹s well-known article, ³The United States 
of Europe Slogan,² written in 1915 and several times 
quoted in the course of our discussions. Zinoviev reproached 
me for not having quoted this article in full; 
but he himself tried to give the article an interpretation 
which cannot be called other than a complete distortion 
of Lenin¹s views, of his basic line on the question of the 
victory of socialism in individual countries. Permit me 
to quote this passage in full. I shall try to indicate by

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 117 
special stress the lines which I omitted previously owing 
to lack of time. Here is the passage: 
³Uneven economic and political development is an absolute 
law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible first 
in several or even in one capitalist country taken separately. The 
victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists 
and organised socialist production, would stand up against 
the rest of the world, the capitalist world, attracting to its cause 
the oppressed classes of other countries, raising revolts in those 
countries against the capitalists, and in the event of necessity coming 
out even with armed force against the exploiting classes and 
their states. The political form of the society in which the proletariat 
is victorious by overthrowing the bourgeoisie will be a democratic 
republic, which will more and more centralise the forces of the 
proletariat of the given nation, or nations, in the struggle against 
the states that have not yet gone over to socialism. The abolition of 
classes is impossible without the dictatorship of the oppressed class, 
the proletariat. The free union of nations in socialism is impossible 
without a more or less prolonged and stubborn struggle of the socialist 
republics against the backward states² (see Vol. XVIII, pp. 232-33). 
Zinoviev, having quoted this passage, made two remarks: 
the first on the democratic republic, and the second 
on the organisation of socialist production. 
Let us, to begin with, discuss the first remark. Zinoviev 
thinks that since Lenin speaks here of a democratic 
republic, he can have in mind at most the seizure of 
power by the proletariat, and Zinoviev was not ashamed 
to hint, rather vaguely but insistently, that what Lenin 
most likely had in mind here was a bourgeois republic. 
Is that true? Of course not. In order to refute this not 
altogether honest hint of Zinoviev¹s, it is enough to 
read the last lines of the passage, where it speaks of the 
³struggle of the socialist republics against the backward 
states.² It is clear that in speaking of a democratic

J. V. S T A L I N 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
118 
republic Lenin had in mind a socialist republic, and 
not a bourgeois republic. 
In 1915 Lenin did not yet know of Soviet power as the 
state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin 
knew already in 1905 that the various Soviets were 
the embryo of revolutionary power in the period of the 
overthrow of tsarism. But he did not then yet know 
of Soviet power united on a country-wide scale as 
the state form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Lenin discovered the Republic of Soviets as the state form 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat only in 1917, and 
he made a detailed analysis of this new form of political 
organisation of a transitional society in the summer of 
1917, chiefly in his book The State and Revolution.28 This, 
in fact, explains why Lenin in the passage quoted speaks 
not of a Soviet republic, but of a democratic republic, 
by which, as is clear from the quotation, he meant 
a socialist republic. Lenin acted in the same way here as 
Marx and Engels did in their time, who before the Paris 
Commune considered the republic in general as the 
form of political organisation of society in the transition 
from capitalism to socialism, but after the Paris Commune 
deciphered this term and said that this republic must 
be of the type of the Paris Commune. This is apart from 
the fact that if what Lenin had in mind in the above 
passage was a bourgeois-democratic republic, there could 
be no question of ³dictatorship of the proletariat,² ³expropriation 
of the capitalists,² etc. 
You see that Zinoviev¹s attempt to ³elaborate² 
Lenin cannot be called successful. 
Let us pass to Zinoviev¹s second remark. Zinoviev 
asserts that Comrade Lenin¹s phrase about ³organisation

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 119 
of socialist production² should be understood not in the 
sense in which normal people generally are bound to understand 
it, but in some other sense, namely, that what Lenin 
had in mind here was only proceeding to organise socialist 
production. Why, on what grounds, Zinoviev did not explain. 
Permit me to say that Zinoviev is here making another 
attempt to ³elaborate² Lenin. It is directly stated 
in the passage quoted that ³the victorious proletariat of 
that country, having expropriated the capitalists and having 
organised socialist production, would stand up against 
the rest of the world, the capitalist world.² It says here 
³having organised,² and not ³organising.² Need it be 
demonstrated that there is a difference here? Need it be 
demonstrated either that if what Lenin had in mind was 
only proceeding to organise socialist production, he would 
have said ³organising,² and not ³having organised.² 
Consequently, Lenin had in mind not only proceeding 
to organise socialist production, but also the possibility 
of organising socialist production, the possibility of 
completely building socialist production in individual 
countries. 
You see that this second attempt of Zinoviev¹s to 
³elaborate² Lenin must likewise be regarded as unsuccessful, 
to say the least of it. 
Zinoviev tried to disguise his attempts to ³elaborate² 
Lenin by facetiously remarking that ³you can¹t build 
socialism in two weeks or two months by a wave of the 
wand.² I am afraid that Zinoviev needed this facetiousness 
in order to put ³a fair face on a bad business.² Where 
has Zinoviev found people who propose to build socialism 
in two weeks, or two months, or two years? If there 
are such people at all, why did he not name them? He

J. V. S T A L I N 120 
did not name them because there are no such people. 
Zinoviev needed this spurious facetiousness in order to 
disguise his ³work² of ³elaborating² Lenin and Leninism.
And so: 
a) proceeding from the law of uneven development under 
imperialism, Lenin, in his fundamental article, ³The 
United States of Europe Slogan,² drew the conclusion 
that the victory of socialism in individual capitalist 
countries is possible; 
b) by the victory of socialism in individual countries, 
Lenin means the seizure of power by the proletariat, 
the expropriation of the capitalists, and the organisation 
of socialist production; moreover, all these tasks 
are not an end in themselves, but a means of standing up 
against the rest of the world, the capitalist world, and 
helping the proletarians of all countries in their struggle 
against capitalism; 
c) Zinoviev tried to whittle down these Leninist 
propositions and to ³elaborate² Lenin in conformity with 
the present semi-Menshevik position of the opposition 
bloc. But the attempt has proved futile. 
Further comment, I think, is superfluous here. 
III 
THE QUESTION OF BUILDING SOCIALISM 
IN THE U.S.S.R. 
Permit me, comrades, to pass now to the question of 
building socialism in our country, in the U.S.S.R.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 121 
1. The ³Manoeuvres² of the Opposition 
and the ³National-Reformism² of Lenin¹s Party 
Trotsky declared in his speech that Stalin¹s biggest 
error is the theory of the possibility of building socialism 
in one country, in our country. It appears, then, that 
what is in question is not Lenin¹s theory of the possibility 
of completely building socialism in our country, 
but of some unknown ³theory² of Stalin¹s. The way I 
understand it is that Trotsky set out to give battle to 
Lenin¹s theory, but since giving open battle to Lenin is 
a risky business, he decided to fight this battle under the 
guise of combating a ³theory² of Stalin¹s. Trotsky in this 
way wants to make it easier for himself to fight Leninism, 
by disguising that fight by his criticism of Stalin¹s 
³theory.² That this is precisely so, that Stalin has 
nothing to do with the case, that there can be no question 
of any ³theory² of Stalin¹s, that Stalin never had 
any pretensions to making any new contributions to 
theory, but only strove to facilitate the complete triumph 
of Leninism in our Party, in spite of Trotsky¹s revisionist 
efforts‹this I shall endeavour to show later. Meanwhile, 
let it be noted that Trotsky¹s statement about 
Stalin¹s ³theory² is a manoeuvre, a trick, a cowardly and 
unsuccessful trick, designed to cover up his fight against 
Lenin¹s theory of the victory of socialism in individual 
countries, a fight which began in 1915 and is continuing 
to the present day. Whether this stratagem of 
Trotsky¹s is a sign of honest polemics, I leave the comrades 
to judge. 
The starting point for the decisions of our Party on 
the question whether it is possible to build socialism

J. V. S T A L I N 122 
in our country is to be found in the well-known programmatic 
works of Comrade Lenin. In those works Lenin 
says that under the conditions of imperialism the victory 
of socialism in individual countries is possible, that 
the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat in solving 
the economic problem of this dictatorship is assured, 
that we, the proletarians of the U.S.S.R., have all that 
is necessary and sufficient for building a complete 
socialist society. 
I have just quoted a passage from the well-known 
article of Lenin¹s where he for the first time raised the 
question of the possibility of the victory of socialism in 
individual countries, and which I therefore shall not 
repeat here. That article was written in 1915. It says 
that the victory of socialism in individual countries‹ 
he seizure of power by the proletariat, the expropriation 
of the capitalists and the organisation of socialist production‹
is possible. We know that Trotsky at that very 
time, in that same year 1915, came out in the press 
against this article of Lenin¹s and called Lenin¹s theory 
of socialism in one country a theory of ³national narrow-
mindedness.² 
The question arises, what has Stalin¹s ³theory² to 
do with this? 
Further, in my report I quoted a passage from 
Lenin¹s well-known work, ³Economics and Politics in the 
Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,² where it 
says plainly and definitely that the victory of the proletariat 
of the U.S.S.R., in the sense of solving the economic 
problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat, may 
be considered assured. This work was written in 1919. 
Here is the passage:

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 123 
³In spite of the lies and slanders of the bourgeoisie of all 
countries and of their open or masked henchmen (the ŒSocialists¹ 
of the Second International), one thing remains beyond 
dispute, viz., that from the point of view of the basic economic problem 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the victory of communism 
over capitalism in our country is assured. Throughout the world the 
bourgeoisie is raging and fuming against Bolshevism and is organising 
military expeditions, plots, etc., against the Bolsheviks, 
just because it fully realises that our success in reconstructing the 
social economy is inevitable, provided we are not crushed by military 
force. And its attempts to crush us in this way are not succeeding²* 
(see Vol. XXIV, p. 510). 
You see that Lenin plainly speaks here of the possibility 
of the victory of the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
in the matter of reconstructing the social economy, in 
the matter of solving the economic problem of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. 
We know that Trotsky and the opposition as a whole 
do not agree with the basic propositions contained in 
this passage. 
The question arises, what has Stalin¹s ³theory² to 
do with this? 
I quoted, lastly, a passage from Lenin¹s well-known 
pamphlet, On Co-operation, written in 1923. In this passage, 
it says: 
³As a matter of fact, state power over all large-scale means 
of production, state power in the hands of the proletariat, the 
alliance of this proletariat with the many millions of small and 
very small peasants, the assured leadership of the peasantry by 
the proletariat, etc.‹is not this all that is necessary for building 
a complete socialist society from the co-operatives, from the 
co-operatives alone, which we formerly looked down upon as 
huckstering and which from a certain aspect we have the right to 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 124 
look down upon as such now, under NEP? Is this not all that is 
necessary for building a complete socialist society? This is not 
yet the building of socialist society, but it is all that is necessary 
and sufficient for this building²* (see Vol. XXVII, p. 392). 
You see that this passage leaves no doubt whatever 
about the possibility of building socialism in our country. 
You see that this passage enumerates the principal 
factors in the building of a socialist economy in our 
country: proletarian power, large-scale production in the 
hands of the proletarian power, an alliance of the proletariat 
and the peasantry, leadership of the proletariat 
in this alliance, co-operation. 
Trotsky endeavoured recently, at the Fifteenth Conference 
of the C.P.S.U.(B.), to counterpose to this quotation 
another quotation from the works of Lenin, where 
it says that ³Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification 
of the whole country² (see Vol. XXVI, p. 46). 
But to counterpose these quotations is to distort the 
basic idea of Lenin¹s pamphlet, On Co-operation. Is not 
electrification a constituent part of large-scale production, 
and is electrification possible at all in our country 
without large-scale production, concentrated in the hands 
of a proletarian state? Is it not clear that when Lenin 
says in his pamphlet On Co-operation that large-scale production 
is one of the factors in the building of socialism, 
this includes electrification? 
We know that the opposition is conducting a more 
or less overt, but mostly covert, fight against the 
basic propositions formulated in this passage from Lenin¹s 
pamphlet, On Co-operation. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 125 
The question arises, what has Stalin¹s ³theory² to 
do with this? 
Such are the basic propositions of Leninism in the 
question of the building of socialism in our country. 
The Party affirms that fundamentally at variance 
with these propositions of Leninism are the postulates 
of Trotsky and the opposition bloc to the effect that 
³the building of socialism within the framework of national 
states is impossible,² that ³the theory of socialism 
in one country is a theoretical justification of national 
narrow-mindedness,² that ³without direct state support 
from the European proletariat, the working class of Russia 
will not be able to maintain itself in power² (Trotsky). 
The Party affirms that these propositions of the 
opposition bloc are the expression of a Social-Democratic 
deviation in our Party. 
The Party affirms that Trotsky¹s formula about 
³direct state support from the European proletariat² is 
a formula that makes a complete break with Leninism. 
For what is implied by making the building of socialism 
in our country dependent on ³direct state support from 
the European proletariat²? What if the European proletariat 
does not succeed in seizing power within the next 
few years? Can our revolution mark time for an indefinite 
period, pending the victory of the revolution in the 
West? Can it be expected that the bourgeoisie of our country 
will agree to wait for the victory of the revolution in 
the West and renounce its work and its struggle against 
the socialist elements in our economy? Does not this 
formula of Trotsky¹s denote the prospect of a gradual 
surrender of our positions to the capitalist elements in 
our economy, and then the prospect of our Party¹s

J. V. S T A L I N 126 
retiring from power in the event of a victorious revolution 
in the West being delayed? 
Is it not clear that what we have here are two absolutely 
different lines, one of which is the line of the Party 
and Leninism, and the other the line of the opposition 
and Trotskyism? 
I asked Trotsky in my report, and I ask him again: 
Is it not true that Lenin¹s theory of the possibility of 
the victory of socialism in individual countries was qualified 
by Trotsky in 1915 as a theory of ³national narrowmindedness²? 
But I received no answer. Why? Is silence 
a sign of courage in polemics? 
I asked Trotsky, further, and I ask him again: Is 
it not true that he repeated the charge of ³national 
narrow-mindedness² against the theory of the building of 
socialism only quite recently, in September 1926, in his 
document addressed to the opposition? But I received 
no answer to this either. Why? Is it not because silence 
with Trotsky is also a sort of ³manoeuvre²? 
What does all this show? 
It shows that Trotsky adheres to his old position of 
fighting Leninism on the basic question of the building 
of socialism in our country. 
It shows that Trotsky, not having the courage to 
come out openly against Leninism, is trying to disguise 
his fight by criticising a non-existent ³theory² of 
Stalin¹s. 
Let us pass to another ³manoeuvrer,² Kamenev. He, 
apparently, was infected by Trotsky and also began to 
manoeuvre. But his manoeuvre turned out to be cruder 
than Trotsky¹s. Trotsky tried to accuse Stalin alone, 
but Kamenev hurled an accusation against the whole

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 127 
Party, declaring that it, that is, the Party, ³replaces 
the international revolutionary perspective by a nationalreformist 
perspective.² How do you like that? Our 
Party, it appears, replaces the international revolutionary 
perspective by a national-reformist perspective. But 
since our Party is Lenin¹s party, and since in its decisions 
on the question of the building of socialism it rests 
wholly and entirely on Lenin¹s well-known propositions, 
it follows that Lenin¹s theory of the building of socialism 
is a national-reformist theory. Lenin a ³nationalreformist²‹
that i s the sort of nonsense Kamenev 
treats us to. 
Are there any decisions of our Party on the question 
of building socialism in our country? Yes, and even very 
definite decisions. When were those decisions adopted 
by the Party? They were adopted at the Fourteenth 
Conference of our Party in April 1925. I am referring 
to the resolution of the Fourteenth Conference on the 
work of the E.C.C.I. and socialist construction in our 
country. Is this resolution a Leninist resolution? Yes, 
it is, because this can be vouched for by such competent 
persons as Zinoviev, who made the report at the Fourteenth 
Conference in defence of this resolution, and 
Kamenev, who presided at this conference and voted 
for this resolution. 
Why, then, did not Kamenev and Zinoviev try to 
convict the Party of contradicting itself, of diverging 
from the resolution of the Fourteenth Conference on the 
question of building socialism in our country, which 
resolution, as we know, was adopted unanimously? 
One would think that nothing could be easier: the 
Party adopted a special resolution on the question of

J. V. S T A L I N 128 
building socialism in our country and Kamenev and 
Zinoviev voted for it, and now both of them accuse the 
Party of national-reformism‹why, then, should they not 
base their argument on so important a Party document as 
the resolution of the Fourteenth Conference, which deals 
with the building of socialism in our country, and which 
is obviously Leninist from beginning to end? 
Did you notice that the opposition in general, and 
Kamenev in particular, avoided the Fourteenth Conference 
resolution as a cat-avoids hot porridge? (Laughter.) 
Why this fear of the Fourteenth Conference resolution, 
which was adopted on Zinoviev¹s motion and passed 
with the active assistance of Kamenev? Why are Kamenev 
and Zinoviev scared of mentioning this resolution even 
casually? Does not this resolution deal with the building 
of socialism in our country? And is not the question of 
the building of socialism the basic question at issue in 
our discussion? 
Then what is the trouble? 
It is that Kamenev and Zinoviev, who supported the 
Fourteenth Conference resolution in 1925, afterwards renounced 
this resolution, and hence, renounced Leninism, 
went over to the side of Trotskyism, and are now scared 
of mentioning this resolution even casually, for fear 
of being exposed. 
What does this resolution say? 
Here is a quotation from the resolution: 
³Generally, the victory of socialism in one country (not in 
the sense of final victory) is unquestionably possible.²* 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 129 
And further: 
³. . . The existence of two directly opposite social systems 
gives rise to the constant menace of capitalist blockade, of other 
forms of economic pressure, of armed intervention, of restoration. 
Consequently, the only guarantee of the final victory of socialism, 
i.e., the guarantee against restoration, is a victorious socialist 
revolution in a number of countries. It by no means follows from 
this that it is impossible to build a complete socialist society in a 
backward country like Russia without the Œstate aid¹* (Trotsky) 
of countries more developed technically and economically. An 
integral part of Trotsky¹s theory of permanent revolution is the 
assertion that Œreal progress of a socialist economy in Russia 
will become possible only after the victory of the proletariat in the 
major European countries¹ (Trotsky, 1922)‹an assertion which 
in the present period condemns the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
to fatalistic passivity. In opposition to such Œtheories,¹ 
Comrade Lenin wrote: ŒInfinitely hackneyed is the argument that 
they learned by rote during the development of West-European 
Social-Democracy, namely, that we are not yet ripe for socialism, 
that, as certain ³learned² gentlemen among them express it, the 
objective economic prerequisites for socialism do not exist in our 
country¹ (Notes on Sukhanov).² (Resolution of the Fourteenth 
Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) on ³The Tasks of the Comintern and 
the R.C.P.(B.) in Connection with the Enlarged Plenum of the 
E.C.C.I.²29) 
You see that the Fourteenth Conference resolution 
is an accurate statement of the basic propositions of 
Leninism on the question of the possibility of building 
socialism in our country. 
You see that the resolution qualifies Trotskyism 
as running counter to Leninism, while a number of theses 
in the resolution are based upon a direct denial of the 
basic tenets of Trotskyism. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 130
You see that the resolution fully reflects the disputes 
that have now again broken out over the question of the 
building of a socialist society in our country. 
You know that my report was based on the guiding 
propositions of this resolution. 
You no doubt remember that in my report I made 
special mention of the Fourteenth Conference resolution 
and accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of having 
violated it, of having departed from this resolution. 
Why did not Kamenev and Zinoviev try to dispel 
that accusation? 
What is the secret? 
The secret is that Kamenev and Zinoviev renounced 
this resolution long ago and, having renounced i t , 
passed over to Trotskyism. 
For either one thing or the other: 
either the Fourteenth Conference resolution is not 
a Leninist resolution‹in which case Kamenev and 
Zinoviev were not Leninists when they voted for it; 
or the resolution is a Leninist resolution‹in which 
case Kamenev and Zinoviev, having renounced the resolution, 
have ceased to be Leninists. 
Some of the speakers here said (Riese was one of 
them, I think) that Zinoviev and Kamenev had not gone 
over to Trotskyism, but, on the contrary, Trotsky had 
gone over to Zinoviev and Kamenev. That is all nonsense, 
comrades. The fact that Kamenev and Zinoviev have renounced 
the Fourteenth Conference resolution is direct 
proof that it is precisely Kamenev and Zinoviev that have 
gone over to Trotskyism. 
And so:

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 131 
Who has renounced the Leninist line in the question 
of the building of socialism in the U.S.S.R., as formulated 
in the resolution of the Fourteenth Conference 
of the R.C.P.(B.)? 
It turns out that Kamenev and Zinoviev have. 
Who has ³replaced the international revolutionary 
perspective² by Trotskyism? 
It turns out that Kamenev and Zinoviev have. 
If Kamenev now howls and clamours about the 
³national-reformism² of our Party, it is because he is 
trying to divert the attention of the comrades from his 
fall from grace and to blame others for his own sins. 
This i s why Kamenev¹s ³manoeuvre² about the 
³national-reformism² of our Party is a trick, an unseemly 
and crude trick, designed to cover up his renunciation 
of the Fourteenth Conference resolution, his renunciation 
of Leninism, his desertion to Trotskyism, by clamouring 
about ³national-reformism² in our Party. 
2. We Are Building and Can Completely Build 
the Economic Basis of Socialism 
in the U.S.S.R. 
I said in my report that the political basis of socialism 
has already been created in our country‹it is the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. I said that the economic basis 
of socialism is still far from having been created, and 
has yet to be created. I said, further, that in consequence 
of this the question stands as follows: have we the possibility 
of building the economic basis of socialism in our 
country by our own efforts? I said, lastly, that if this 
question is put in class language, it takes the following

J. V. S T A L I N 132 
form: have we the possibility of overcoming our, Soviet, 
bourgeoisie by our own efforts? 
Trotsky asserted in his speech that when I spoke 
of overcoming the bourgeoisie in the U.S.S.R., I meant 
overcoming it politically. That, of course, is not true. 
It is a factional fancy of Trotsky¹s. It will be seen from 
my report that when I spoke of overcoming the bourgeoisie 
in the U.S.S.R., I meant overcoming it economically, 
because, politically, it has already been overcome. 
What does overcoming the bourgeoisie in the 
U.S.S.R. economically mean? Or in other words: what 
does creating the economic basis of socialism in the 
U.S.S.R. mean? 
³To create the economic basis of socialism means welding 
agriculture and socialist industry into one integral economy, subordinating 
agriculture to the leadership of socialist industry, 
regulating relations between town and country on the basis of an 
exchange of the products of agriculture and industry, closing and 
eliminating all the channels which facilitate the birth of classes 
and, above all, of capital, and, in the long run, establishing such 
conditions of production and distribution as will lead directly 
and immediately to the abolition of classes² (see Stalin¹s report 
at the Seventh Enlarged Plenum of the E.C.C.I.*). 
That is how I defined in my report the essence of 
the economic basis of socialism in the U.S.S.R. 
This definition is an exact formulation of the definition 
of the ³economic essence,² the ³economic basis² 
of socialism given by Lenin in his draft of the pamphlet, 
The Tax in Kind.30 
* See this volume, pp. 23-24.‹Ed.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 133 
Is this definition correct, and can we count on the 
possibility of completely building the economic basis of 
socialism in our country?‹that is now the fundamental 
point of our disagreements. 
Trotsky did not even touch upon this question. He 
simply avoided it, apparently considering that it would 
be wiser to say nothing about it. 
But that we are building, and can completely build, 
the economic basis of socialism is evident if only from 
the fact that: 
a) our socialised production is large-scale and united 
production, whereas non-nationalised production in our 
country is small-scale and dispersed production, and 
it is known that the superiority of large-scale, and moreover 
united, production over small-scale production is 
an indisputable fact; 
b) our socialised production is already directing and 
beginning to bring under its control small-scale production, 
irrespective whether the latter is urban or rural; 
c) on the front of the struggle between the socialist 
elements in our economy and the capitalist elements, 
the former have undoubted superiority over the latter 
and are progressing step by step, overcoming the capitalist 
elements in our economy both in the sphere of production 
and in the sphere of circulation. 
I shall not stop to mention other factors which make 
for the victory of the socialist elements in our economy 
over the capitalist elements. 
What grounds are there for supposing that the process 
of overcoming the capitalist elements in our economy 
will not continue in future? 
Trotsky said in his speech:

J. V. S T A L I N 134 
³Stalin says that we are engaged in the building of socialism, 
that is, are working for the abolition of classes and the state, that 
is, are overcoming our bourgeoisie. Yes, comrades, but the state 
needs an army against external enemies² (I quote from the verbatim 
report.‹J. St.). 
What does this mean? What is the sense of this passage? 
From this passage, only one conclusion can be 
drawn: since completely building the economic basis of 
socialism implies abolition of classes and the state, 
and since we shall nevertheless need an army for the protection 
of the socialist homeland, while an army without 
a state is impossible (so Trotsky thinks), it follows that 
we cannot completely build the economic basis of socialism 
until the necessity for armed defence of the 
socialist homeland has disappeared. 
That, comrades, is a mixing up of all concepts. 
Either what is meant by the state here is simply an apparatus 
for the armed defence of socialist society‹which is 
absurd, for the state is primarily the weapon of one 
class against other classes, and it is self-evident that 
if there are no classes there cannot be a state. Or an 
army for the defence of socialist society is here considered 
inconceivable without the existence of a state‹which 
again is absurd, for it is theoretically quite possible 
to grant the existence of a state of society in which there 
are no classes and no state, but there is an armed people 
defending its classless society against external enemies. 
Sociology provides quite a number of examples of the 
existence in the course of human history of societies which 
had no classes and no state, but which defended themselves 
in one way or another against external enemies. 
It is similarly possible to conceive a future classless

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 135 
society which, having no classes and no state, may nevertheless 
have a socialist militia, essential for defence 
against external enemies. I consider it hardly likely that 
such a state of things may occur in our country, because 
there is no reason to doubt that the achievements of 
socialist construction in our country, and still more the 
victory of socialism and the abolition of classes, will be 
facts of such historic significance that they cannot fail 
to evoke a mighty impulse towards socialism among the 
proletarians of the capitalist countries, can not fail to 
evoke revolutionary explosions in other countries. But, 
theoretically, a state of society is quite conceivable in 
which there is a socialist militia, but no classes and no 
state. 
Incidentally, this question is to a certain extent 
dealt with in the programme of our Party. Here is what 
it says: 
³The Red Army, as an instrument of the proletarian dictatorship 
must necessarily be of a frankly class character, that is, it 
must be recruited exclusively from the proletariat and the related 
semi-proletarian strata of the peasantry. Only with the abolition 
of classes will such a class army be converted into a socialist militia 
of the whole people²* (see Programme of the C.P.S.U.(B.)31). 
Trotsky has evidently forgotten this point in our 
programme. 
In his speech Trotsky spoke of the dependence of 
our national economy on world capitalist economy, and 
asserted that ³from isolated War Communism we are 
coming more and more to coalescence with world economy.² 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 136 
It follows from this that our national economy, with 
its struggle between the capitalist and socialist elements, 
is coalescing with world capitalist economy. I 
say capitalist world economy because at the present time 
no other world economy exists. 
That is not true, comrades. It is absurd. It is a factional 
fancy of Trotsky¹s. 
No one denies that there exists a dependence of our 
national economy on world capitalist economy. No one 
denies this, or has denied it, just as no one denies that 
there exists a dependence of every country and every national 
economy, not excluding the American national 
economy, on international capitalist economy. But this 
dependence is mutual. Not only does our economy depend 
upon the capitalist countries, but the capitalist countries, 
too, depend upon our economy, upon our oil, our 
grain, our timber and, lastly, our boundless market. 
We receive credits, say, from Standard Oil. We receive 
credits from German capitalists. But we receive them 
not because of our bright eyes, but because the capitalist 
countries need our oil, our grain and our market for 
the disposal of their machinery. It must not be forgotten 
that our country constitutes one-sixth of the world, 
that it constitutes a huge market, and the capitalist 
countries cannot manage without some connection or 
other with our market. All this means that the capitalist 
countries depend upon our economy. The dependence is 
mutual. 
Does this mean that the dependence of our national 
economy on the capitalist countries precludes the possibility 
of building a socialist economy in our country? 
Of course not. To depict a socialist economy as some

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 137 
thing absolutely self-contained and absolutely independent 
of the surrounding national economies is to talk 
nonsense. Can it be asserted that a socialist economy will 
have absolutely no exports or imports, will not import 
products it does not itself possess, and will not, in consequence 
of this, export its own products? No, it cannot. 
And what are exports and imports? They are an 
expression of the dependence of countries upon other 
countries. They are an expression of economic interdependence. 
The same must be said of the capitalist countries 
of today. You cannot imagine a single country which 
does not export and import. Take America, the richest 
country in the world. Can it be said that the present-day 
capitalist states, Britain or America, say, are absolutely 
independent countries? No, it cannot. Why? Because 
they depend on exports and imports, they depend on the 
raw materials of other countries (America, for instance, 
depends on rubber and other raw materials), they depend 
on the markets in which they sell their machinery and 
other finished goods. 
Does this mean that since there are no absolutely 
independent countries, the independence of individual 
national economies is thereby precluded? No, it does 
not. Our country depends upon other countries just as 
other countries depend upon our national economy; but 
this does not mean that our country has thereby lost, or 
will lose, its independence, that it cannot uphold its 
independence, that it is bound to become a cog in international 
capitalist economy. A distinction must be drawn 
between the dependence of some countries on others and 
the economic independence of these countries. Denying

J. V. S T A L I N 138 
the absolute independence of individual national economic 
units does not mean, and cannot mean, denying the 
economic independence of these units. 
But Trotsky speaks not only of the dependence of 
our national economy. He converts this dependence into 
a coalescence of our economy with capitalist world 
economy. But what does the coalescence of our national 
economy with capitalist world economy mean? It means 
its conversion into an appendage of world capitalism. 
But is our country an appendage of world capitalism? 
Of course not! It is nonsense to say so, comrades. It is 
not talking seriously. 
If it were true, we should be quite unable to uphold 
our socialist industry, our foreign trade monopoly, our 
nationalised transport system, our nationalised credit 
system, our planned direction of economy. 
If it were true, our socialist industry would already 
be on the way to degenerating into ordinary capitalist 
industry. 
If it were true, we should have no successes on the 
front of the struggle of the socialist elements of our economy 
against the capitalist elements. 
Trotsky said in his speech: ³In reality, we shall 
always be under the control of world economy.² 
It follows from this that our national economy will 
develop under the control of world capitalist economy, 
because at the present time no other world economy than 
capitalist world economy exists. 
Is that true? No, it is not. That is the dream of the 
capitalist sharks, but one that will never be realised. 
What does the control of capitalist world economy 
mean? In the mouths of the capitalists, control is not

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 139 
an empty word. In the mouths of the capitalists, control 
is something real. 
Capitalist control means first of all financial control. 
But have not our banks been nationalised, and are 
they functioning under the direction of European capitalist 
banks? Financial control means the establishment 
in our country of branches of big capitalist banks, the 
formation of what are known as ³subsidiary² banks. But 
are there such banks in our country? Of course not! Not 
only are there no such banks, but there never will be so 
long as Soviet power exists. 
Capitalist control means control over our industry, the 
denationalisation of our socialist industry, the denationalisation 
of our transport system. But is not our industry 
nationalised and is it not developing precisely as nationalised 
industry? Does anyone intend to denationalise 
even a single one of our nationalised enterprises? I don¹t 
know, of course, what they are thinking of in Trotsky¹s 
Chief Concessions Committee. (Laughter.) But that there 
will be no room for denationalisers in our country so 
long as Soviet power exists, of that you may be certain. 
Capitalist control means a free run of our market, 
it means abolition of the monopoly of foreign trade. I 
know that the Western capitalists have time and again 
dashed their heads against the wall, trying to shatter 
the armour-plate of the foreign trade monopoly. You 
know that the foreign trade monopoly is the shield and 
protection of our young socialist industry. But have 
the capitalists achieved any success in liquidating the 
foreign trade monopoly? Is it so hard to understand that 
so long as Soviet power exists, the foreign trade monopoly 
will continue to live and flourish, in spite of everything?

J. V. S T A L I N 140 
Capitalist control, lastly, means political control, 
the destruction of the political independence of our country, 
the adaptation of its laws to the interests and tastes 
of international capitalist economy. But is not our country 
a politically independent country? Are not our laws 
dictated by the interests of the proletariat and the masses 
of the working people of our country? Why not cite facts, 
even one fact, to show that our country is losing its political 
independence? Let them try to do so. 
That is how the capitalists understand control, if, 
of course, we are speaking of real control, and not chattering 
idly about some imaginary control. 
If it is real capitalist control of this nature we are 
discussing‹and it is only such control we can discuss, 
because only wretched scribblers can indulge in idle chatter 
about imaginary control‹I must say that in our 
country there is no such control, and there never will 
be so long as our proletariat lives and so long as we 
have Soviet power. (Applause.) 
Trotsky said in his speech: 
³The idea is, within the encirclement of the capitalist world 
economy, to build an isolated socialist state. This can be achieved 
only if the productive forces of this isolated state will be superior 
to the productive forces of capitalism; because, looked at from the 
perspective not of one year or even ten years, but of a half-century 
or even a century, only such a state, such a new social form can 
firmly establish itself, whose productive forces prove to be more 
powerful than the productive forces of the old economic system² 
(see verbatim report of Trotsky¹s speech at the Seventh Enlarged 
Plenum of the E.C.C.I.). 
It follows from this that some fifty or even a hundred 
years will be needed for the socialist system of 
economy to prove in practice its superiority over the

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 141 
capitalist system of economy from the standpoint of the 
development of productive forces. 
That is not true, comrades. It is a mixing up of all 
concepts and perspectives. 
It required, I think, about two hundred years, or 
somewhat less, for the feudal system of economy to 
prove its superiority over the slave system of economy. 
And it could not be otherwise, since the rate of development 
at that time was dreadfully slow, and the technique 
of production was more than primitive. 
It required about a hundred years, or somewhat less, 
for the bourgeois system of economy to prove its superiority 
over the feudal system of economy. Already in 
the depths of feudal society the bourgeois system of economy 
revealed that it was superior, far superior, to the 
feudal system of economy. The difference in the periods 
is to be explained by the faster rate of development and 
the more highly developed technology of the bourgeois 
system of economy. 
Since then technology has achieved unprecedented 
successes, and the rate of development has become truly 
furious. What grounds, then, has Trotsky for assuming 
that the socialist system of economy will require about 
a hundred years to prove its superiority over the capitalist 
system of economy? 
Is not the fact that our production will be headed 
not by parasites, but by the producers themselves‹is 
not this a most powerful factor ensuring that the socialist 
system of economy will have every chance of advancing 
the economy with giant strides, and of proving its 
superiority over the capitalist system of economy in a 
much shorter period?

J. V. S T A L I N 142 
Does not the fact that socialist economy is the most 
united and concentrated economy, that socialist economy 
is conducted on planned lines‹does not this fact indicate 
that socialist economy will have every advantage, 
and be able in a comparatively short period to prove 
its superiority over the capitalist system of economy, 
which is torn by internal contradictions and corroded by 
crises? 
In view of all this, is it not clear that to hold out here 
a perspective of fifty or a hundred years means to suffer 
from the superstitious faith of the scared petty bourgeois 
in the almighty power of the capitalist system of 
economy? (Voices: ³Quite right!²) 
And what are the conclusions? There are two conclusions. 
Firstly. In controverting the possibility of building 
socialism in our country, Trotsky retreated from his 
old polemical stand and adopted another. Formerly the 
opposition based its objections on internal contradictions, 
on the contradictions between the proletariat and 
the peasantry, considering these contradictions insuperable. 
Now Trotsky stresses external contradictions, the 
contradictions between our national economy and world 
capitalist economy, considering these contradictions insuperable. 
Whereas, formerly, Trotsky believed that the 
stumbling-block of socialist construction in our country 
is the contradictions between the proletariat and the 
peasantry, now he has changed front, retreated to another 
stand from which to criticise the Party¹s position, and 
asserts that the stumbling-block of socialist construction 
is the contradictions between our system of economy 
and capitalist world economy. Thereby he has in fact

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 143 
admitted the untenability of the opposition¹s old arguments. 
Secondly. But Trotsky¹s retreat is a retreat into 
the wilderness, into the morass. Trotsky has, in point 
of fact, retreated to Sukhanov, directly and openly. 
What, in point of fact, do Trotsky¹s ³new² arguments 
amount to? They amount to this: owing to our economic 
backwardness we are not ripe for socialism, we have not 
the objective prerequisites for building a socialist economy, 
and as a result our national economy is being converted, 
and is bound to be converted, into an appendage 
of capitalist world economy, into an economic unit controlled 
by world capitalism. 
But this is ³Sukhanovism,² open and undisguised. 
The opposition has sunk to the position of the Menshevik 
Sukhanov, to his attitude of bluntly denying 
the possibility of the victorious building of socialism in 
our country. 
3. We Are Building Socialism in Alliance 
with the World Proletariat 
That we are building socialism in alliance with the 
peasantry is something, I think, which our opposition 
does not venture openly to deny. Whether we are building 
socialism in alliance with the world proletariat, 
this the opposition is inclined to doubt. Some of the 
oppositionists even assert that our Party underestimates 
the importance of this alliance. And one of them, Kamenev, 
has even gone so far as to accuse the Party of 
national-reformism, of replacing the international revolutionary 
perspective by a national-reformist perspective.

J. V. S T A L I N 144 
That, comrades, is nonsense. The most arrant nonsense. 
Only madmen can deny the paramount importance 
of an alliance of the proletarians of our country with the 
proletarians of all other countries in the building of 
socialism. Only madmen can accuse our Party of underestimating 
the importance of an alliance of the proletarians 
of all countries. Only in alliance with the world 
proletariat is it possible to build socialism in our country. 
The whole point is how this alliance is to be understood. 
When the proletarians of the U.S.S.R. seized power 
in October 1917, this was assistance to the proletarians 
of all countries; it was an alliance with them. 
When the proletarians of Germany made a revolution 
in 1918, this was assistance to the proletarians of all 
countries, especially the proletarians of the U.S.S.R.; 
it was an alliance with the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
When the proletarians of Western Europe frustrated 
intervention against the U.S.S.R., refused to transport 
arms for the counter-revolutionary generals, set up 
councils of action and undermined the rear of their capitalists, 
this was assistance to the proletarians of the 
U.S.S.R.; it was an alliance of the West-European proletarians 
with the proletarians of the U.S.S.R. Without this 
sympathy and this support of the proletarians of the capitalist 
countries, we could not have won the Civil War. 
When the proletarians of the capitalist countries 
send a series of delegations to our country, check 
our constructive work and then spread the news of the 
successes of our constructive work to all the workers of 
Europe, this is assistance to the proletarians of the 
U.S.S.R., i t is support of the highest value for the

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 145 
proletarians of the U.S.S.R., it is an alliance with the 
proletarians of the U.S.S.R., and a curb on possible imperialist 
intervention in our country. Without this support 
and without this curb, we should not now be having 
a ³respite,² and without a ³respite² there could be no 
widely developed work on the building of socialism in 
our country. 
When the proletarians of the U.S.S.R. consolidate 
their dictatorship, put an end to economic disruption, 
develop constructive work and achieve successes in the 
building of socialism, this is support of the highest value 
for the proletarians of all countries, for their struggle 
against capitalism, their struggle for power; because the 
existence of the Soviet Republic, its steadfastness, 
its successes on the front of socialist construction, 
are factors of the highest value for the world revolution, 
factors that encourage the proletarians of all countries in 
their struggle against capitalism. It can scarcely be 
doubted that the destruction of the Soviet Republic 
would be followed by the blackest and most savage reaction 
in all capitalist countries. 
The strength of our revolution and the strength of 
the revolutionary movement in the capitalist countries 
lie in this mutual support and in this alliance of the 
proletarians of all countries. 
Such are the diverse forms of the alliance between the 
proletarians of the U.S.S.R. and the world proletariat. 
The error of the opposition consists in the fact that 
it does not understand or does not recognise these forms 
of alliance. The trouble of the opposition is that it recognises 
only one form of alliance, the form of ³direct state 
support² rendered to the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. by

J. V. S T A L I N 146 
the proletarians of Western Europe, i.e., a form which, 
unfortunately, is not yet being applied; and the opposition 
makes the fate of socialist construction in the 
U.S.S.R. directly dependent upon such support being 
rendered in the future. 
The opposition thinks that only by recognising this 
form of support can the Party retain its ³international 
revolutionary perspective.² But I have already said that 
if the world revolution should be delayed, this attitude 
can only lead to endless concessions on our part to the 
capitalist elements in our economy and, in the long run, 
to capitulationism, to defeatism. 
It therefore follows that ³direct state support² from 
the European proletariat, which the opposition holds 
out as the only form of alliance with the world proletariat, 
would, if the world revolution should be delayed, 
serve as a screen for capitulationism. 
Kamenev¹s ³international revolutionary perspective² 
as a screen for capitulationism‹this, it appears, is 
where Kamenev is heading for. 
One can therefore only wonder at the audacity with 
which Kamenev spoke here, in accusing our Party of 
national reformism. 
Whence this, to put it mildly, audacity of Kamenev¹s, 
who has never been distinguished either for his revolutionary 
spirit or his internationalism? 
Whence this audacity of Kamenev¹s, who has always 
been considered by us a Bolshevik among Mensheviks, 
and a Menshevik among Bolsheviks? (Laughter.) 
Whence this audacity of Kamenev¹s, whom Lenin at 
one time with full justification called a ³black-leg² of 
the October Revolution?

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 147 
Kamenev wants to know whether the proletariat of 
the U.S.S.R. is internationalist. I must declare that the 
proletariat of the U.S.S.R. needs no testimonial from 
a ³black-leg² of the October Revolution. 
You want to know the extent of the internationalism 
of the proletariat of the U.S.S.R.? Well, ask the British 
workers, ask the German workers (stormy applause), ask 
the Chinese workers‹they will tell you about the internationalism 
of the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
4. The Question of Degeneration 
It may therefore be regarded as demonstrated that 
the attitude of the opposition is one of direct denial 
of the possibility of victoriously building socialism in 
our country. 
But denying the possibility of victoriously building 
socialism leads to the perspective of the degeneration 
of the Party, and the perspective of degeneration, in 
its turn, leads to retirement from power and the issue 
of forming another party. 
Trotsky pretended that he could not take this seriously. 
But that was camouflage. 
There can be no doubt that, if we cannot build socialism, 
and the revolution in other countries is delayed, 
while capital in our country grows, just as the ³coalescence² 
of our national economy with world capitalist 
economy also grows‹then, from the point of view of the 
opposition, there can be only two alternatives: 
a) either to remain in power and pursue a bourgeoisdemocratic 
policy, to take part in a bourgeois government, 
hence, to pursue a ³Millerandist² policy;

J. V. S T A L I N 148 
b) or to retire from power, so as not to degenerate, 
and, parallel with the official party, to form a new 
party‹which indeed is what our opposition was striving 
for and, in point of fact, is continuing to strive for now. 
The theory of two parties, or the theory of a new 
party, is the direct result of denying the possibility 
of victoriously building socialism, the direct result of 
the perspective of degeneration. 
Both these alternatives lead to capitulationism, to 
defeatism. 
How did the question stand in the period of the Civil 
War? It stood as follows: if we do not succeed in organising 
an army and repulsing our enemies, the dictatorship 
of the proletariat will fall and we shall lose power. 
At that time the war held first place. 
How does the question stand now, when the Civil War 
is over and the tasks of economic construction have come 
to hold first place? Now the question stands as follows: 
if we cannot build a socialist economy, then the dictatorship 
of the proletariat will have to make more and 
more serious concessions to the bourgeoisie and must degenerate 
and follow in the wake of bourgeois democracy. 
Can Communists agree to pursue a bourgeois policy, 
with the dictatorship of the proletariat in process of 
degenerating? 
No, they cannot, and must not. 
Hence the way out: to retire from power and form a 
new party, having cleared the way for the restoration of 
capitalism. 
Capitulationism as the natural result of the present 
attitude of the opposition bloc‹such is the conclusion.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 149 
IV 
THE OPPOSITION AND THE QUESTION 
OF PARTY UNITY 
I pass to the last question, the question of the opposition 
bloc and the unity of our Party. 
How was the opposition bloc formed? 
The Party affirms that the opposition bloc was 
formed by the passing over of the ³New Opposition,² the 
passing over of Kamenev and Zinoviev, to Trotskyism.
Zinoviev and Kamenev deny this, and hint that it 
was not they who went over to Trotsky, but Trotsky who 
came over to them. 
Let us turn to the facts. 
I have spoken of the Fourteenth Conference resolution 
on the building of socialism in our country. I said 
that Kamenev and Zinoviev renounced that resolution, a 
resolution which Trotsky does not and cannot accept, and 
renounced it in order to come closer to Trotsky and to 
go over to Trotskyism. Is that true or not? Yes, it is 
true. Did Kamenev and Zinoviev try in any way to controvert 
that assertion? No, they did not. They passed over 
the question in silence. 
We have, further, the resolution of the Thirteenth 
Conference of our Party which qualifies Trotskyism as a 
petty-bourgeois deviation and a revision of Leninism.32 
This resolution, as you know, was endorsed by the Fifth 
Congress of the Comintern. I said in my report that Kamenev 
and Zinoviev had renounced this resolution and, 
in their special statements, had declared that in its 
struggle against the Party in 1923 Trotskyism was right. 
Is that true or not? Yes, it is true. Did Zinoviev and

J. V. S T A L I N 150 
Kamenev try in any way to controvert that assertion? 
No, they did not. They passed it over in silence. 
Here are some more facts. In 1925, Kamenev wrote 
as follows about Trotskyism: 
³Comrade Trotsky has become the channel through which 
the petty bourgeois elemental forces manifest themselves in our 
Party. The whole character of his pronouncements and his whole 
past history prove that this is so. In his fight against the Party 
he has already become a symbol in the country for everything 
opposed to our Party.² . . . ³We must take every measure to prevent 
this non-Bolshevik teaching from infecting those sections of our 
Party which it reckons to capture, namely, our youth, those who 
will have in the future to take the destiny of the Party into 
their hands. It must therefore be the immediate task of our Party 
to adopt every means of explaining the incorrectness of Comrade 
Trotsky¹s position, that it is necessary to choose between Trotskyism 
and Leninism, that the two cannot be combined²* (see Kamenev, 
³The Party and Trotskyism,² in the symposium For Leninism, 
pp. 84-86). 
Would Kamenev be bold enough to repeat those words 
now? If he is prepared to repeat them, why is he now in 
a bloc with Trotsky? If he does not venture to repeat 
them, is it not clear that Kamenev has deserted his old 
position and has gone over to Trotskyism? 
In 1925, Zinoviev wrote this about Trotskyism: 
³Comrade Trotsky¹s latest pronouncement (The Lessons of October) 
is nothing but a fairly open attempt to revise or even directly 
liquidate the fundamentals of Leninism.* It will not be very long 
before this becomes clear to our whole Party and the whole International² 
(see Zinoviev, ³Bolshevism or Trotskyism,² in the symposium 
For Leninism, p. 120). 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 151 
Compare this quotation from Zinoviev with what 
Kamenev said in his speech‹³We are with Trotsky because 
he does not revise Lenin¹s fundamental ideas²‹ 
and you will realise the full depth of Kamenev¹s and 
Zinoviev¹s fall. 
In that same year, 1925, Zinoviev wrote this about 
Trotsky: 
³The question now being decided is, what is the R.C.P. in 
1925? In 1903, it was decided by the attitude towards the first 
paragraph of the Rules, and in 1925 by the attitude towards 
Trotsky and Trotskyism. Whoever says that Trotskyism may be a 
Œlegitimate shade¹ in the Bolshevik Party, himself ceases to be 
a Bolshevik. Whoever now wants to build the Party in alliance 
with Trotsky, in collaboration with that Trotskyism which is openly 
coming out against Bolshevism, is retreating from the fundamentals 
of Leninism.* It must be realised that Trotskyism is a stage of the 
past, that the Leninist party can now be built only in opposition 
to Trotskyism² (Pravda, February 5, 1925). 
Would Zinoviev be bold enough to repeat those words 
now? If he is prepared to repeat them, why is he now in 
a bloc with Trotsky? If he cannot repeat them, is it 
not clear that Zinoviev has deserted Leninism and gone 
over to Trotskyism? 
What do all these facts show? 
That the opposition bloc was formed by the passing 
over of Kamenev and Zinoviev to Trotskyism. 
What is the platform of the opposition bloc? 
The platform of the opposition bloc is the platform 
of a Social-Democratic deviation, the platform of a 
Right-wing deviation in our Party, a platform for gathering 
together all kinds of opportunist trends for the 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 152 
purpose of organising a fight against the Party, against 
its unity, against its authority. Kamenev speaks of a 
Right-wing deviation in our Party, hinting at the Central 
Committee. But that is a trick, a crude and dishonest 
trick, designed to screen the opportunism of the opposition 
bloc by means of loud accusations against the Party. 
In actual fact, it is the opposition bloc that is the expression 
of a Right-wing deviation in our Party. We 
judge the opposition not by its statements, but by its 
deeds. And the deeds of the opposition show that it is a 
rallying centre and hotbed for all kinds of opportunist 
elements, from Ossovsky and the ³Workers¹ Opposition² 
to Souvarine and Maslow, Korsch and Ruth Fischer. 
The restoration of factionalism, the restoration of the 
theory of freedom of factions in our Party, a rallying of 
all the opportunist elements in our Party, a fight against 
the unity of the Party, a fight against its leading cadres, 
a fight for the formation of a new party‹that is what 
the opposition is now driving for, if we are to judge 
from Kamenev¹s speech. In this respect Kamenev¹s speech 
marks a turning point from the opposition¹s ³statement² 
of October 1926 to a resumption of the opposition¹s 
splitting policy. 
What is the opposition bloc from the point of view of 
Party unity? 
The opposition bloc is the embryo of a new party 
within our Party. Is it not a fact that the opposition 
had its own Central Committee and its own parallel local 
committees? In its ³statement² of October 16, 1926, the 
opposition gave assurances that it had renounced factionalism. 
But does not Kamenev¹s speech show that it has 
gone back to the factional struggle? What guarantee is

THE SEVENTH ENLARGED PLENUM OF THE E.C.C.I. 153 
there that the opposition has not already re-established 
its central and local parallel organisations? Is it not a 
fact that the opposition collected special membership 
dues for its treasury? What guarantee is there that it 
has not resumed this splitting course? 
The opposition bloc is the embryo of a new party, 
undermining the unity of our Party. 
The task is to smash this bloc and liquidate i t . 
(Stormy applause.) 
Comrades, at a time when imperialism is dominant 
in other countries, when one country and only one country 
has succeeded in breaching the front of capital, under 
such conditions the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot 
exist for a single moment without a united party armed 
with iron discipline. Attempts to undermine the Party¹s 
unity, attempts to form a new party, must be rooted out 
if we want to preserve the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
if we want to build socialism. 
The task therefore is to liquidate the opposition 
bloc and consolidate the unity of our Party. 
V 
CONCLUSION 
I am concluding, comrades. 
If we sum up the discussion, we can arrive at one 
general conclusion that is beyond all doubt, namely, 
that the Fourteenth Congress of our Party was right when 
it said that the opposition is infected with disbelief in 
the strength of our proletariat, disbelief in the possibility 
of victoriously building socialism in our country. 
That is the general residual impression and the

J. V. S T A L I N 154 
general conclusion which the comrades cannot have failed 
to form. 
Thus, you have before you two forces. On the one 
hand, you have our Party, which is confidently leading 
the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. forward, building socialism 
and summoning the proletariat of all countries to 
the struggle. On the other hand, you have the opposition, 
hobbling along behind our Party like a decrepit old man 
with rheumatic legs, an aching back and a pain in the 
head‹an opposition that sows pessimism around it and 
poisons the atmosphere with its twaddle to the effect 
that nothing will come of socialism in the U.S.S.R., that 
over there, among the bourgeois, everything is all right, 
and that over here, among the proletarians, everything 
is all wrong. 
Those, comrades, are the two forces confronting you. 
It is for you to make your choice between them. 
(Laughter.) 
I have no doubt that you will make the right choice. 
(Applause.) 
The opposition, in its factional blindness, regards 
our revolution as something devoid of all independent 
strength, as a sort of gratuitous supplement to the future 
revolution in the West, which has not yet won victory. 
That is not the way Comrade Lenin regarded our revolution, 
the Republic of Soviets. Comrade Lenin regarded 
the Republic of Soviets as a torch which illumines thepath 
of the proletarians of all countries. 
Here is what Comrade Lenin said on this score: 
³The example of the Soviet Republic will stand before them 
(that is, the proletarians of all countries.‹J. St.) for a long time 
to come. Our socialist Republic of Soviets will stand secure as a

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
155 
torch of international socialism and as an example to all the labouring 
masses. Over there‹conflict, war, bloodshed, the sacrifice 
of millions of lives, capitalist exploitation; here‹a genuine policy 
of peace and a socialist Republic of Soviets² (see Vol. XXII, 
p. 218). 
Around this torch two fronts have formed: the front 
of the enemies of the proletarian dictatorship, who are 
striving to discredit this torch, to upset and extinguish 
it, and the front of the friends of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat, who are striving to hold the torch aloft 
and to fan its flame. 
The task is to hold this torch aloft and to make its 
existence secure for the sake of the victory of the world 
revolution. 
Comrades, I do not doubt that you will do all you 
can that the torch may burn bright and illumine the road 
of all the oppressed and enslaved. 
I do not doubt that you will do all you can to fan 
this torch into full flame, to the terror of the enemies 
of the proletariat. 
I do not doubt that you will do all you can so that 
similar torches may be lighted in all parts of the world, 
to the joy of the proletarians of all countries. (Continuous 
and prolonged applause. All delegates rise and sing 
the ³Internationale,² followed by three cheers.)

LETTER TO KSENOFONTOV 
I have read your letter and the draft of the article. 
I apologise for being late in replying. 
Here are my comments: 
1) I object to your calling yourself ³a disciple of 
Lenin and Stalin.² I have no disciples. Call yourself 
a disciple of Lenin; you have the right to do so, notwithstanding 
Shatskin¹s criticism. But you have no 
grounds for calling yourself a disciple of a disciple of 
Lenin¹s. It is not true. It is out of place. 
2) I object to your referring in a controversy with 
Shatskin at the close of 1926 to a personal letter from 
me written in July 1924. All the more because the question 
under discussion, about a definition of Leninism, 
was formulated by me in March 1924, before the appearance 
of my book, On Lenin and Leninism.33 That is 
apart from the fact that such a reference to a passage 
in my letter, while not helping you in the least in 
your controversy with Shatskin, confuses the issue and 
carries the argument on to another plane, and may compel 
me to come out with a statement in the press that would 
not be in your favour (which I would not like to do). 
3) I consider that in the main Shatskin is right and

LETTER TO KSENOFONTOV 157 
you are wrong. I regret that I did not have the opportunity 
of looking through your new pamphlet on strategy. 
I would certainly have dissuaded you from publishing 
a work so hastily and carelessly compiled and containing 
a number of gross errors and incorrect formulations. 
4) That, of course, does not mean that Shatskin is 
right in everything. I shall enumerate his principal 
errors. 
Shatskin, for instance, is mistaken in that passage 
of his article in which he regards Marx¹s formula about 
the impossibility of accomplishing the task of the working 
class within national boundaries as being almost 
identical with Lenin¹s formula about the possibility of 
the victory of socialism in one country. Instead of bringing 
out the difference between these formulas and disclosing 
its historical roots, Shatskin evaded the issue 
with a note that says absolutely nothing, thus slurring 
over a most important question. But an evasion is not 
a solution of a question. 
Shatskin i s also mistaken when he unwittingly 
contrasts two of Lenin¹s formulas about the dictatorship 
of the proletariat (the dictatorship as the rule of one 
class, and the dictatorship as a special form of alliance 
between the proletariat and the toiling sections 
of the non-proletarian classes, with leadership of 
the state by the proletariat). Shatskin is right in rejecting 
the idea of the peasantry being a partner in power, 
the idea of a division of power between two classes 
under the dictatorship. But he is wrong when he contrasts 
these two formulas, for by contrasting them, 
he shows that he does not understand them.

J. V. S T A L I N 158 
Nor do I like the crudely self-assured tone of Shatskin¹s 
articles; he himself preaches modesty, but in 
fact he displays the utmost self-assurance. 
5) I advise you not to start a controversy in the press, 
because you are wrong and Shatskin, in the main, is 
right. You would do better to devote yourself to a diligent 
and thoughtful study of Leninism. Furthermore, 
I advise you to give up once and for all the habit of 
hastily concocting booklets on Leninism. It will not do.

Published for the first time

SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE FIFTEENTH 
MOSCOW GUBERNIA PARTY CONFERENCE34 
January 14, 1927 
Comrades, I did not intend to take the floor. I did 
not intend to do so because everything that needed to be 
said at the conference has already been said by other 
comrades, there was nothing new to say here‹and to 
repeat what has already been said would be pointless. 
However, in view of the requests of a number of delegations, 
I shall have to say a few words. 
What is the chief and characteristic feature of the 
situation of our country, looked at from the point of 
view of its administration, from the point of view of the 
direction of all our constructive work? 
The chief and characteristic feature is that the Party 
has been able to hit upon the correct policy‹the basic 
line of the Party has proved correct, and its guiding directives 
have proved sound. 
Lenin said: 
Ten or twenty years of a correct policy towards the 
peasantry, and our victory is assured. 
What does that mean? It means that at the present 
moment of history the question of the mutual relations 
between the proletariat and the peasantry is the chief 
question for us. Well, our practical activity, our work, 
the work of the Party, shows that the Party has been able 
to hit upon the correct solution of this question.

J. V. S T A L I N 160 
What is required in order that the Party¹s policy 
in this basic question should be correct? 
What is required, firstly, is that the Party¹s policy 
should ensure the bond, the alliance between the working 
class and the peasantry. 
What is required, secondly, is that the Party¹s 
policy should ensure the leadership of the proletariat 
within this alliance, within this bond. 
In order to guarantee the bond, it is necessary that 
our financial policy in general, and our taxation policy 
in particular, should be in conformity with the interests 
of the labouring masses, that our price policy should be 
a correct one, one that answers to the interests of the 
working class and the peasantry, and that a co-operative 
communal life should be implanted in the towns and, especially, 
in the countryside systematically, day by day. 
I think that in this respect we are on the right road. 
Otherwise, we should be having most serious complications. 
I shall not say that we have no difficulties in this 
field. There are difficulties, and very grave ones. But 
we are surmounting them. And we are surmounting them 
because our policy is in the main correct. 
And what is required to ensure the proletariat¹s 
leadership of the peasantry? What is essential for that 
is the industrialisation of the country. What is essential 
for that is that our socialist industry should grow and 
strengthen. What is essential for that is that our growing 
socialist industry should give the lead to agriculture. 
Lenin said that every new mill and every new factory 
will strengthen the position of the working class, 
as regards leadership of the countryside, to such an ex

SPEECH AT XV MOSCOW GUBERNIA PARTY CONFERENCE 161 
tent that no petty-bourgeois elemental forces will have 
any terrors for us. He said that in 1921. Five years have 
passed since then. In this period our industry has grown, 
new mills and factories have made their appearance. 
And we find that every new factory and every new 
mill is a new fortress in the hands of the proletariat, 
assuring its leadership of the vast masses of the 
peasantry. 
You see that in this field, too, the Party has been 
able to hit on the correct policy. 
I shall not say that we have no difficulties in this 
field. There are difficulties, of course, but we are not 
afraid of them, and we are overcoming them because 
our policy is basically correct. 
It is said that the Soviet government is the most 
stable of all the existing governments in the world. 
That is true. And what is the explanation of it? The 
explanation is that the policy of the Soviet government 
is the only correct policy. 
But is it enough merely to have a correct policy to 
be able to vanquish each and every difficulty that arises 
in our path? 
No, it is not. 
For that at least two other conditions are required. 
First condition. It is necessary, above all, that the 
correct policy elaborated by the Party should be actually 
put into effect, should be actually carried out wholly and 
completely. 
The first thing, of course, is to have a correct policy. 
But if that policy is not put into effect, or if it is distorted 
in practice when being put into effect, what is the 
use of such a policy? There are cases when a policy is

J. V. S T A L I N 162 
correct but is not carried out, or not in the way it should 
be carried out. We have quite a number of such cases 
just now. It was just such cases that Lenin had in mind 
when at the Eleventh Congress, in the last report he 
made,35 he said: 
Our policy is correct, but that is not enough; hence 
the point now is to arrange for the proper selection of 
personnel and to organise the checking of fulfilment. 
Selection of personnel and the checking of fulfilment‹ 
those are the points on which Lenin focussed attention 
in his last report. I think that we should have this directive 
of Lenin¹s in mind during the whole period of our 
constructive work. In order to guide the work of construction, 
it is not enough to have correct directives; 
it is necessary in addition that we appoint to the leading 
posts in our Soviet, economic, co-operative and all other 
work of construction people who understand the meaning 
and importance of those directives, who are capable of 
carrying them out honestly and conscientiously, and who 
regard the carrying out of those directives not as an 
empty formality, but as a matter of honour, a matter of 
supreme duty to the Party and the proletariat. 
That is the way we must understand Lenin¹s slogan: 
proper selection of personnel and the checking of fulfilment. 
Yet we sometimes find the very opposite occurring. 
There are people who to all appearances recognise the 
instructions of the higher organs of the Party and the 
Soviet government, but in actual practice pigeonhole 
them and continue to pursue an entirely different policy. 
Is it not a fact that sometimes certain directors of some 
apparatuses‹economic, co-operative, and other‹pigeon

SPEECH AT XV MOSCOW GUBERNIA PARTY CONFERENCE 163 
hole the Party¹s correct instructions and continue to 
follow the old beaten track? If, for example, the central 
organs of the Party and of the Soviet government decide 
that the immediate task of our policy is to lower retail 
prices, but a number of co-operative officials, and trade 
officials generally, ignore this decision, preferring to 
evade it‹what are we to call that? What is that, if not 
a frustration of that correct policy upon the conscientious 
implementation of which depends the fate of the bond, 
the fate of the alliance between the workers and the peasants, 
the fate of the Soviet regime? 
It was just such cases Lenin had in mind when he said: 
Our line is correct, but the machine is not moving 
in the direction in which it should be moving. 
And what is the explanation of this disharmony between 
the line and the machine? Why, to the fact that 
the constituents of the machine, of the apparatus, are 
not always of good quality. 
That is why proper selection of personnel and the 
checking of fulfilment now constitute one of the immediate 
tasks of the Party and the Soviet government. 
That is why the Party must be keenly attentive to 
see that the leading officials in charge of our constructive 
work are selected with a view to the conscientious 
implementation of the policy of the Party and the Soviet 
government. 
Second condition. But that, of course, does not exhaust 
the matter. It is necessary, in addition, to secure 
an improvement in the quality of the Party¹s leadership 
of the masses and thus facilitate the broad mass of the 
workers, and of the peasants as well, being drawn into all 
our constructive work. The first thing, of course, is to

J. V. S T A L I N 164 
ensure leadership by the proletariat. But the proletariat 
manifests its will to lead through the Party. It is impossible 
to lead our constructive work if there is a bad 
party at the head. For the proletariat to be able to lead, 
its party must be equal to its mission of being the supreme 
leader of the masses. And what does that require? It 
requires that the Party¹s leadership should not be formal, 
not on paper, but effective. It requires that the 
Party¹s leadership should be flexible to the maximum 
degree. 
It is said that if the broad masses of the working 
class are not brought into action, we cannot be victorious 
on the construction front. That is perfectly 
true. But what does it mean? It means that if the broad 
masses are to be drawn into our work of construction, 
they must be led correctly, flexibly, and not heedlessly. 
And who must lead the masses? The Party must lead the 
masses. But the Party cannot lead the masses if it does 
not take into account the changes that have taken place 
among the workers and peasants in recent years. One cannot 
now carry out leadership in the old way‹merely by 
issuing orders and instructions. The time for that kind 
of leadership has passed. Nowadays, mere formal leadership 
can only cause irritation. Why? Because the activity 
of the working class has grown, and its requirements 
have grown; the workers have become more sensitive 
to shortcomings in our work, and they have become more 
exacting. 
Is that a good thing? Of course, it is. That is what we 
have always been striving for. But it follows that leading 
the working class is becoming a more complicated matter, 
and that the character of the leadership must be more

SPEECH AT XV MOSCOW GUBERNIA PARTY CONFERENCE 165 
flexible. Formerly, it could happen that you trod on 
people¹s toes‹and it did not matter. But that won¹t 
do now, comrades! Now the utmost attentiveness is 
required even to the most insignificant trifles, for it is 
of these trifles that the life of the workers is made up. 
The same must be said of the peasants. The peasant 
today is not what he was two or three years ago. He, too, 
has become more sensitive and politically conscious. He 
reads the articles of those who are called leaders and discusses 
them; he picks every one of the leaders to pieces 
and forms his own opinion of them. Don¹t run away with 
the idea that he is stupid, as certain wiseacres sometimes 
try to make out. No, comrades, the peasant is cleverer 
than many wiseacres of the towns. Well then, he wants 
to be treated with consideration. Here, as in the case 
of the workers, you cannot confine yourself merely to 
resolutions. Here, as in the case of the workers, you 
have to explain the instructions of the Party and the 
Soviet government, explain them patiently and attentively, 
so that people may understand what the Party 
wants and in what direction it is leading the country. 
If they don¹t understand it today, be good enough to 
explain it the next day. If they don¹t understand it the 
next day, be good enough to explain it the day after that. 
Without this, there will not and cannot be any leadership 
nowadays. 
That, of course, does not mean that we must give up 
leadership. No. The masses cannot respect the party if 
it gives up leadership, if it ceases to lead. The masses 
themselves want to be led, and they are looking for firm 
leadership. But the masses want the leadership to be not 
formal, not on paper, but effective and comprehensible

J. V. S T A L I N 166 
to them. Precisely for that reason it is necessary patiently 
to explain the aims and objects, the directives 
and instructions of the Party and the Soviet government. 
Leadership must not be given up; neither must it be 
relaxed. On the contrary, it must be strengthened. But 
if it is to be strengthened, it must be made more flexible, 
and the Party must arm itself with the utmost sensitiveness 
to the requirements of the masses. 
I am concluding, comrades. Our policy is correct, 
and therein lies our strength. But two conditions at 
least must be fulfilled if our policy is not to become 
a dead letter. Firstly, proper selection of personnel and 
checking of fulfilment of the Party¹s directives. Secondly, 
flexible leadership of the masses and the utmost sensitiveness 
to the requirements of the masses‹sensitiveness, 
and again sensitiveness. (Loud, prolonged applause and 
an ovation from the whole hall. All rise and sing the ³Internationale.²)

LETTER TO COMRADE ZAITSEV 
I am late in replying about Comrade Zhirov¹s article. 
But better late than never. 
I objected to Comrade Zhirov¹s article on the uneven 
development of the capitalist countries being published 
in the Bolshevik for the following reasons. 
1) The article, in my opinion, is schoolboyish. It 
is evident that the author has not mastered the subject 
and has no idea of its complexity. Such articles may 
conveniently be printed in school magazines, where people 
can practise with a view to one day becoming mature 
writers. But the Bolshevik is a journal of leadership; it 
is expected to give guidance on fundamental questions 
of theory and policy, and therefore to print Comrade 
Zhirov¹s article in the Bolshevik means, firstly, to confuse 
the mind of the reader, and, secondly, to damage 
the reputation of the Bolshevik as a journal of leadership. 
2) Comrade Zhirov is clearly mistaken when he puts 
on a par the political aspect of the law of uneven development 
of the capitalist countries and its economic aspect. 
That these two aspects constitute the substance of the 
law of uneven development is, of course, true. But that 
political unevenness does not just now constitute an 
urgent question for us from the standpoint of our present 
disputes with the opposition in the C.P.S.U.(B.) is not 
open to the slightest doubt. What is to be regarded

J. V. S T A L I N 168 
as the most glaring expression of political unevenness 
at the present time from the angle of world development? 
The fact that we have an advanced form of government, 
proletarian government, Soviet government, whereas the 
most technically and culturally developed countries have 
a backward form of government, that is, bourgeois government. 
Does the opposition deny the possibility or the 
existence of this political unevenness? No, it does not. 
On the contrary, it considers that the seizure of power 
by the proletariat in one country is quite possible. 
Hence, i t is not in this field that our disagreements 
lie. 
Our disagreements begin with the question‹is it 
possible to defeat the bourgeoisie economically, that is, 
is it possible, given the existence of Soviet power, to 
build socialism in one country that is encircled by capitalist 
countries? Consequently, the disagreements lie 
in the economic field. That is why we give prominence 
to the economic aspect of the law of uneven development 
of the capitalist countries. Comrade Zhirov¹s mistake 
is that he has overlooked this specific feature of our 
disputes with the opposition, and has taken the prominence 
given to the economic aspect of the law of uneven 
development as a negation of the political aspect of 
this law. 
In brief, Comrade Zhirov has failed to see the point 
of our disputes with the opposition. 
This is apart from the fact that the economic aspect 
of the law of uneven development is, in itself, the basis 
of all the catastrophes, including political catastrophes, 
in the sphere of the development of capitalist world 
economy.

LETTER TO COMRADE ZAITSEV 169 
3.) Comrade Zhirov fails to see the full profundity 
of the difference between pre-imperialist and imperialist 
capitalism. For him, the law of uneven development 
becomes a mere matter of ³disproportion and disharmony² 
in the development of world capitalism. But if that is 
so, whence the difference between capitalism whose development 
is on the upgrade and moribund capitalism, 
the development of which is on the downgrade? Whence 
the difference between capitalism which is smoothly 
evolving and capitalism whose development is a process 
of decay, of spasmodic leaps and catastrophes? Why is 
it that the victory of socialism in separate countries was 
impossible formerly, but has become possible now? Can 
we disregard such facts as the dominance of finance capital, 
the gigantic advance of technology, the levelling 
tendency, the division of the world into spheres of influence, 
the impetuous and spasmodic development of capitalist 
countries, accompanied by catastrophes and periodic 
redivisions of the already divided world and by the 
possibility of the victory of socialism in separate 
countries? 
In what way does Comrade Zhirov¹s attitude differ in 
this instance from that of our opposition, and why indeed, 
on what grounds, is he quarrelling with the opposition? 
Comrade Zhirov evidently does not realise that, unlike 
sociological laws, which are applicable to all phases 
of social development, the laws of development of 
capitalism may and must change. Under pre-imperialist 
capitalism, the law of uneven development had one form, 
with corresponding consequences; under imperialist capitalism, 
the law assumes a different form, and its consequences 
are accordingly different. That is why one can,

J. V. S T A L I N 170 
and should, speak of uneven development of the capitalist 
countries under imperialism, in contrast to the 
uneven development under the old capitalism. How the 
laws of capitalism alter at different stages of capitalist 
development, how their action becomes more limited 
or more powerful depending on the changing conditions‹ 
this is a question of special theoretical interest, to which 
a man who undertakes to write a special article on the 
law of uneven development should first of all have given 
consideration. Comrade Zhirov¹s misfortune (not his 
fault) is that he completely fails to see this aspect of the 
question. 
4) I shall not deal with other questions touched upon 
in Comrade Zhirov¹s article and on which, in my opinion, 
he himself is not clear‹such as the ³non-subjectivity of 
the world capitalist system,² and so on. It is evident 
to me that Comrade Zhirov is itching to say something 
distinctive and startling. 
5) As to the suggested editorial note to Comrade Zhirov¹s 
article, I consider that such editorial notes are out 
of place in so responsible a journal as the Bolshevik. 
To declare that the editorial board ³is not in agreement 
with some of the author¹s propositions,² and not to say 
what those propositions are, would be to evade the issue 
and perplex the reader. I think that notes of that kind 
should not be given in the Bolshevik. 
With communist greetings,

Published for the first time

TO THE LENA WORKERS 
The shooting down of the Lena workers in April fifteen 
years ago was one of the bloodiest atrocities of 
the tsarist autocracy. The gallant fight of our comrades 
slain by tsarist bullets in the far-off taiga has not been 
forgotten by the victorious proletariat. Looking back 
on the path they have travelled, the workers of the 
Soviet Union can say: Not a single drop of the blood 
of the Bodaibo workers was shed in vain, for the enemies 
of the proletariat have received their deserts, and the 
proletariat has already established its victory over them. 
Now, delivered from tsarist and capitalist oppression, 
you are in a position to mine gold on the banks 
of the Vitim not for the enrichment of parasites, but 
for the enhancement of the might of your own workers¹ 
state, the first of its kind in the world. 
Honour and glory to those who laid down their lives 
fighting for the victory of the working class! 
Greeting you, dear comrades, on this day of remembrance 
of the heroic struggle of our fallen comrades, 
permit me to express my confidence that you will firmly 
and unswervingly carry on the struggle for the full victory 
of socialism in our country.

GREETINGS TO THE STALINGRAD 
NEWSPAPER BORBA 
Dear Comrades, 
The ten years of Borba¹s36 militant activity at its 
revolutionary post gives rise to a glorious anniversary of 
which the workers of Stalingrad may well be proud. 
The struggle against the generals‹Krasnov and Denikin‹
the driving out of the counter-revolutionaries and 
Western interventionists, the overcoming of economic disruption, 
the achievements on the front of the peaceful 
building of a new life‹such are the chief events in the 
life of the Stalingrad proletariat during these past ten 
years. Throughout this period Borba has stood in the 
front ranks of the fighters for socialism, lighting the 
way for the working people. 
Ardent greetings to Borba! I wish it fresh successes!

SPEECH DELIVERED AT A MEETING 
OF WORKERS OF THE STALIN RAILWAY 
WORKSHOPS, OCTOBER RAILWAY 
March 1, 1927 
(Abbreviated Report) 
Comrades, it is usually ³expected² of an orator to 
hold forth without end while others listen to him without 
end. I think that on this occasion we shall adopt a somewhat 
different procedure. I shall confine myself to answering 
the questions put to me in written form by various 
comrades. I think that that will be more lively. If 
you agree, I shall get down to business. 
The majority of the questions boil down to one: 
shall we have war this year, in the spring or autumn 
of this year? 
My reply is that we shall not have war this year, 
neither in the spring nor in the autumn. 
The reason we shall not have war this year is not 
that there is no danger at all of imperialist wars. No, 
the danger of war exists. There will be no war this year 
because our enemies are not ready to go to war, because 
they more than anyone else fear the outcome of a war, 
because the workers of the West do not want to fight the 
U.S.S.R., and to fight without the workers is impossible, 
and, lastly, because we are conducting a firm and unwavering 
policy of peace, and this fact makes it difficult 
to make war on our country. 
Having substantiated this opinion by facts drawn 
from the sphere of our relations with the Western Powers,

J. V. S T A L I N 174 
great and small, Comrade Stalin went on to speak of the 
policy of the U.S.S.R. in the East. 
We are told that our policy of friendship with the 
dependent and colonial peoples of the East is fraught 
with certain concessions on our part, and, consequently, 
involves certain expenses for us. That, of course, is 
true. But any other policy would be unacceptable to us 
not only from the standpoint of principle, but also from 
the standpoint of the cost of our foreign policy. That 
we cannot in principle pursue any other policy than one 
of friendship follows from the very nature of the Soviet 
power, which has shattered the fetters of imperialism 
and built its might on this basis. Hence I shall not 
dilate on this point. 
Let us examine the matter from the standpoint of 
the cost of our foreign policy. Our state frontiers with the 
countries in the East, with China, Afghanistan, Persia 
and Turkey, have, as you know, a length of several thousand 
versts. On these frontiers we now maintain an insignificant 
number of troops, who are on friendly relations 
with the inhabitants of the border states, and 
we are able to allow ourselves this gigantic economy 
in regard to the protection of our frontiers precisely 
because we pursue a policy of friendship with those 
states. 
But let us assume that our relations with those countries 
were not friendly, but hostile, as they were at the 
time of the Russian autocracy. We should then be obliged 
to maintain several armies on those frontiers armed 
from head to foot, and a whole number of warships 
in the Far East, as certain imperialist countries now do. 
And what would the maintenance of several armies on

SPEECH AT A MEETING OF WORKERS OF RAILWAY WORKSHOPS 175 
those frontiers and a corresponding navy mean? It would 
mean an annual expenditure of hundreds of millions of 
rubles out of public money for those armies and that 
navy. That also would be an Eastern policy. But it would 
be the most unthrifty, the most wasteful and most dangerous 
of all conceivable policies. That is why I think 
that our policy in the East is the most correct in principle, 
the surest from the point of view of political results, and 
the most economical of all possible policies in the East. 
This is apart from the fact that such a policy assures 
us stable peace in the East not only with the colonial 
and dependent countries, but also with Japan. 
After a number of speakers had taken part in the 
discussion on the mandate to the deputies, Comrade 
Stalin again took the floor to reply to a number of new 
questions submitted in writing by members of the audience. 
Comrades, permit me to reply to the additional notes 
sent in by comrades. Two questions stand out in these 
notes: the possibility of a rupture of Anglo-Soviet diplomatic 
relations, and the question of the principal 
achievements in our work of economic construction. 
Will Britain break the 1921 trade agreement? Will 
she sever diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R.? 
Of course, a rupture of relations on the part of 
Britain is not excluded. But I think it is hardly likely. 
It is hardly likely because a rupture can only be of disadvantage 
to Britain. This is apart from the fact that, 
in view of the peaceful policy of the U.S.S.R., responsibility 
for a rupture would be the heaviest of all possible 
heavy responsibilities that the British Government could 
take upon itself at the present time. . . .

J. V. S T A L I N 176 
What is our principal achievement in the work of 
economic construction? 
We are told that there are shortcomings in our constructive 
work. We are told that these shortcomings have 
not yet been eliminated. That is all true, comrades. 
There are many shortcomings in our mills and factories, 
as also in our administrative apparatus. It would be 
strange if there were no shortcomings, bearing in mind 
the colossal scale of the work we have undertaken. But 
the crux of the matter does not lie in these shortcomings. 
The crux of the matter now is that we have succeeded in 
starting the industrialisation of our country by our own 
efforts. 
What does the industrialisation of our country mean? 
It means transforming an agrarian country into an industrial 
country. It means putting our industry on a new 
technical basis and developing it on that basis. 
Nowhere in the world before has a huge and backward 
agrarian country been transformed into an industrial 
country without plundering colonies or foreign countries, 
or without big loans and long-term credits from abroad. 
Recall the history of the industrial development of Britain, 
Germany, America, and you will realise that this 
is so. Even America, the mightiest of all the capitalist 
countries, was obliged after the civil war to exert itself 
for not less than thirty or forty years in order to build 
up her industry with the help of loans and long-term 
credits from abroad and the plundering of neighbouring 
countries and islands. 
Can we adopt this ³tried and tested² course? No, 
we cannot, because the nature of the Soviet regime is 
such that it will not tolerate colonial robbery, and be

SPEECH AT A MEETING OF WORKERS OF RAILWAY WORKSHOPS 177 
cause we have no grounds for counting on large loans or 
long-term credits. 
The old Russia, tsarist Russia, took a different road 
towards industrialisation‹by negotiating enslaving 
loans and by granting enslaving concessions for the 
main branches of our industry. You know that practically 
the whole of the Donbas, more than half the industry 
of St. Petersburg, the Baku oil-fields and a number 
of the railways, to say nothing of the electrical industry, 
were in the hands of foreign capitalists. That was 
industrialisation at the expense of the peoples of the 
U.S.S.R. and against the interests of the working class. 
It is obvious that we cannot adopt that course; we did 
not fight against the capitalist yoke, we did not overthrow 
capitalism, in order later to place ourselves voluntarily 
under the yoke of capitalism. 
Only one course remains, that of accumulating our 
own funds, that of economising, that of thrifty management 
of our economy in order to accumulate the necessary 
resources for the industrialisation of our country. It 
goes without saying that that is a difficult task. But 
despite its difficulty, we are already accomplishing it. 
Yes, comrades, four years after the Civil War, we are 
already accomplishing this task. That is the point, 
comrades, and that is our principal achievement. 
This year we are assigning 1,300 million rubles for 
the needs of industry. With that money we are building 
new plants and repairing old ones, installing new machinery, 
and increasing the numbers of the working class. 
We have thus reached a position where we are laying the 
foundation of a new industry on the basis of our own 
accumulations. We have reached a position where we are

J. V. S T A L I N 178 
erecting the majestic edifice of a new, socialist industry 
with our own resources. That is our principal achievement, 
comrades. 
It is said that this majestic edifice has certain defects 
‹that the plastering is not what it should be, that here 
and there the wallpaper is peeling off, that in some corners 
there is litter that has not yet been swept up, and so 
on. All that is true. But is that the point, is that the chief 
thing? Is the majestic edifice of a new industry being 
erected, or is it not? Yes, it is. And is this edifice being 
built with our own resources, or is it not? Yes, with our 
own resources. Is it not clear that in the matter of economic 
construction, in the matter of industrialisation, 
we are already achieving the chief and principal thing? 
That is the basis of our achievements. 
Some comrades are inclined to ascribe these successes 
exclusively to our Party. That, in fact, explains why 
some comrades praise our Party out of all proportion. 
It is to this, too, that must be attributed the fact that 
some Communists are disposed to brag and to become 
conceited‹a weakness to which, unfortunately, our comrades 
are still given. Of course, the basically correct policy 
of our Party has played a very great part in achieving 
these successes. But the policy of our Party would not be 
worth a farthing, were it not for the truly friendly support 
it receives from the vast masses of non-Party workers. 
Indeed, our Party is strong precisely because it has the 
support of the masses of non-Party workers. That, comrades, 
should never be forgotten. (Stormy applause.)

March 3, 1927

LETTER TO COMRADES TSVETKOV 
AND ALYPOV 
Your inquiry of March 1, 1927, is in my opinion 
based on a misunderstanding. And for the following 
reasons. 
1) I did not in my report37 speak of the formation 
of an ³autocratic system² in Russia, but of the formation 
of centralised multi-national states in Eastern Europe 
(Russia, Austria, Hungary). It is not difficult to understand 
that these are two different subjects, although they 
cannot be regarded as being unconnected. 
2) Neither in my report, nor in my theses38 did I 
say that a centralised state was formed in Russia ³not 
as a result of economic development, but in the interest 
of the struggle against the Mongols and other Oriental 
peoples² (see your letter). It is you that must answer 
for making this contrast, not I. All I said was that, owing 
to the requirements of defence, the process of formation 
of centralised states in Eastern Europe was more rapid 
than the process of the constitution of people into 
nations, as a result of which multi-national states were 
formed in these parts before the abolition of feudalism. 
This, as you see, is not what you incorrectly ascribe 
to me.

J. V. S T A L I N 180 
Here is a quotation from my report: 
³In Eastern Europe, on the contrary, the process of formation 
of nations and of the liquidation of feudal disunity did not coincide 
in time with the process of formation of centralised states. 
I have in mind Hungary, Austria and Russia. In those countries 
capitalism had not yet developed; it was, perhaps, only just beginning 
to develop; but the needs of defence against the invasion 
of the Turks, Mongols and other Oriental peoples called for the 
immediate formation of centralised states capable of checking the 
onslaught of the invaders. Since the process of formation of centralised 
states in Eastern Europe was more rapid than the process 
of the constitution of people into nations, mixed states were 
formed there, consisting of several peoples who had not yet formed 
themselves into nations, but who were already united in a common 
state.²39 
And here is a quotation from my theses, adopted by 
the Tenth Party Congress: 
³Where the formation of nations on the whole coincided in 
time with the formation of centralised states, the nations naturally 
assumed state forms, they developed into independent bourgeois 
national states. That is what happened in Britain (excluding 
Ireland), in France and Italy. In Eastern Europe, on the contrary, 
the formation of centralised states, accelerated by the needs of 
self-defence (invasion by Turks, Mongols, etc.), took place before 
feudalism was liquidated; hence, before the formation of nations. 
As a consequence, the nations here did not, and could not, develop 
into national states; instead, several mixed, multi-national 
bourgeois states were formed, usually consisting of one strong 
dominant nation and of several weak, subject nations. Examples: 
Austria, Hungary, Russia.²40 
I would request you to give attention to the words 
emphasised in these passages. 
3) If you examine the whole of my report at the Tenth 
Congress, and also the theses on the national question

LETTER TO COMRADES TSVETKOV AND ALYPOV 181 
(the first part), you will have no difficulty in convincing 
yourselves that the theme of the report is not the formation 
of an ³autocratic system,² but the formation of 
multi-national centralised states in Eastern Europe and 
the factors which accelerated that process.

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF A WORKERS¹ 
AND PEASANTS¹ GOVERNMENT 
Reply to Dmitriev 
Your letter of January 14, 1927, to the Bolshevik 
on the subject of a workers¹ and peasants¹ government 
was forwarded to me at the Central Committee for reply. 
Owing to pressure of work I am answering with some delay, 
for which please excuse me. 
1) The question must not be put in the way that 
some comrades put it: ³a workers¹ and peasants¹ government‹
is it a fact or an agitational slogan?² One must 
not say that, although we actually do not have a workers¹ 
and peasants¹ government, we can nevertheless speak of 
a workers¹ and peasants¹ government as an agitational 
slogan. From such a formulation it follows that our 
Party is capable of issuing slogans that are intrinsically 
false, that are actually untenable, slogans in which the 
Party itself does not believe, but which it nevertheless 
puts into circulation in order to deceive the masses. 
Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and bourgeois 
democrats may act in that way, because divergence between 
words and deeds and deception of the masses are 
one of the principal weapons of these moribund parties. 
But that can never, under any circumstances, be the attitude 
of our Party, for it is a Marxist party, a Leninist 
party, an ascending party, and one that draws its 
strength from the fact that its words are not at variance

CONCERNING QUESTION OF WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ GOVERNMENT 183 
with its deeds, that it does not deceive the masses, tells 
them nothing but the truth, and builds its policy not 
on demagogy, but on a scientific analysis of class forces. 
The question must be put this way: either we do not 
have a workers¹ and peasants¹ government, in which 
case the slogan of a workers¹ and peasants¹ government 
must be discarded as superfluous and false; or we do in 
fact have a workers¹ and peasants¹ government, and its 
existence is in conformity with the state of the class 
forces, and in that case the slogan of the workers¹ and 
peasants¹ government is a correct and revolutionary one. 
Either the one or the other. You have to choose. 
2) You call the slogan of a workers¹ and peasants¹ 
government ³Comrade Stalin¹s formula.² That is quite 
untrue. In point of fact, this slogan or, if you like, this 
³formula² is Lenin¹s slogan and nobody else¹s. I merely 
repeated it in my Questions and Answers.41 Take Lenin¹s 
Works, Vol. XXII, pp. 13, 15, 90, 133, 210; Vol. XXIII, 
pp. 93, 504; Vol. XXIV, p. 448, and Vol. XXVI, p. 184, 
where Lenin speaks of Soviet power as a ³workers¹ 
and peasants¹ government.² Take Vol. XXIII, pp. 58, 
85, 86, 89; Vol. XXIV, pp. 115, 185, 431, 433, 436, 
539, 540; Vol. XXV, pp. 82, 146, 390, 407, and Vol. 
XXVI, pp. 24, 39, 40, 182, 207, 340, where Lenin speaks 
of Soviet power as ³workers¹ and peasants¹ power.² Take all 
these, and certain other works of Lenin as well, and you 
will realise that the slogan or ³formula² of a workers¹ 
and peasants¹ government is Lenin¹s slogan or ³formula,² 
and nobody else¹s. 
3) Your basic error is that you confuse: 
a) the question of our government with that of our 
state;

J. V. S T A L I N 184 
b) the question of the class nature of our state and 
of our government with that of the day-to-day policy 
of our government. 
Our state must not be confused, and, hence, identified, 
with our government. Our state is the organisation 
of the proletarian class as the state power, whose function 
it is to crush the resistance of the exploiters, to 
organise a socialist economy, to abolish classes, etc. 
Our government, however, is the top section of this state 
organisation, its top leadership. The government may 
make mistakes, may commit blunders fraught with the 
danger of a temporary collapse of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat; but that would not mean that the proletarian 
dictatorship, as the principle of the structure of the 
state in the transition period, is wrong or mistaken. 
It would only mean that the top leadership is bad, that 
the policy of the top leadership, the policy of the government, 
is not in conformity with the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and must be changed in conformity with 
the demands of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
The state and the government are alike in their 
class nature, but the government is narrower dimensionally, 
and does not embrace the whole state. They are 
organically connected and interdependent, but that does 
not mean that they may be lumped together. 
You see, then, that our state must not be confused 
with our government, just as the proletarian class must 
not be confused with the top leadership of the proletarian 
class. 
But it is still less permissible to confuse the question 
of the class nature of our state and of our government 
with that of the day-to-day policy of our govern

CONCERNING QUESTION OF WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ GOVERNMENT 185 
ment. The class nature of our state and of our government 
is self-evident‹it is proletarian. The aims of our 
state and our government are also evident‹they amount 
to crushing the resistance of the exploiters, to organising 
a socialist economy, abolishing classes, etc. All that 
is evident. 
But what, in that case, does the day-to-day policy 
of our government amount to? It amounts to the ways 
and means by which the class aims of the proletarian dictatorship 
can be realised in our peasant country. The 
proletarian state is needed in order to crush the resistance 
of the exploiters, to organise a socialist economy, to 
abolish classes, etc. Our government, however, is needed 
in order, in addition to all this, to chart the ways and 
means (the day-to-day policy), without which the accomplishment 
of these tasks would be unthinkable in our 
country, where the proletariat constitutes a minority, 
and the peasantry the overwhelming majority. 
What are these ways and means? What do they amount 
to? Fundamentally, to measures designed to preserve 
and strengthen the alliance between the workers and the 
main mass of the peasantry, to preserve and strengthen 
within this alliance the leading role of the proletariat, 
which is in power. It scarcely needs proof that without 
such an alliance, and apart from such an alliance, our 
government would be powerless, and we should not be in 
a position to accomplish those tasks of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat of which I have just spoken. How 
long will this alliance, this bond, exist, and until when 
will the Soviet government continue its policy of strengthening 
this alliance, this bond? Obviously, just so long as 
there are classes, and just so long as there is a government,

J. V. S T A L I N 186 
as an expression of class society, as an expression of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Moreover, it must be borne in mind that: 
a) we need the alliance of the workers and the peasants 
not in order to preserve the peasantry as a class, 
but to transform and remould it in a way that will contribute 
to the victory of socialist construction; 
b) the Soviet government¹s policy of strengthening 
this alliance is designed not to perpetuate, but to abolish 
classes, to hasten the tempo of their abolition. 
Lenin was therefore absolutely right when he wrote: 
³The supreme principle of the dictatorship is the maintenance 
of the alliance of the proletariat and the peasantry in order 
that the proletariat may retain its leading role and state power² 
(Vol. XXVI, p. 460). 
There is no need to prove that it is precisely this 
proposition of Lenin¹s, and nothing else, that constitutes 
the guiding line of the Soviet government in its dayto-
day policy, that the Soviet government¹s policy at 
the present stage of development is essentially a policy 
of preserving and strengthening precisely such an alliance 
between the workers and the main mass of the peasantry. 
It is in this sense‹and in this sense alone, and not 
in the sense of its class nature‹that the Soviet government 
is a workers¹ and peasants¹ government. 
Not to recognise this is to depart from the path of 
Leninism and to take the path of rejecting the idea 
of a bond, of an alliance, between the proletariat and 
the labouring masses of the peasantry. 
Not to recognise this means to believe that the bond 
is a manoeuvre and not a real revolutionary matter,

CONCERNING QUESTION OF WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ GOVERNMENT 187 
to believe that we introduced NEP for the purpose of 
³agitation,² and not for the purpose of building socialism 
in conjunction with the main mass of the peasantry. 
Not to recognise this is to believe that the fundamental 
interests of the main mass of the peasantry cannot 
be satisfied by our revolution, that these interests 
are in irreconcilable contradiction to the interests 
of the proletariat, that we cannot, and must not, build 
socialism in conjunction with the main mass of the peasantry, 
that Lenin¹s co-operative plan is unworkable, 
that the Mensheviks and their echoers are right and so 
forth. 
One has only to put these questions in this way to 
realise how utterly putrid and worthless is the ³agitational² 
approach to this cardinal question of the bond. 
That is why I said in my Questions and Answers that the 
slogan of a workers¹ and peasants¹ government is not 
³demagogy² and not an ³agitational² manoeuvre, but 
an absolutely correct and revolutionary slogan. 
In brief, the class nature of the state and the government, 
which determines the principal objectives of the 
development of our revolution, is one thing, and the dayto-
day policy of the government, the ways and means of 
carrying out this policy in order to attain those objectives, 
is another. The two, unquestionably, are interconnected. 
But that does not mean that they are identical, 
that they may be lumped together. 
You see, then, that the question of the class nature of 
the state and the government must not be confused with 
that of the day-to-day policy of the government. 
It may be said that there is a contradiction here: 
how can a government which is proletarian in its class

J. V. S T A L I N 188 
nature be called a workers¹ and peasants¹ government? 
But the contradiction is only a seeming one. As a matter 
of fact, there is the same sort of ³contradiction² 
here as some of our wiseacres try to discern between 
Lenin¹s two formulas about the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
one of which says that ³the dictatorship of the 
proletariat is the rule of one class² (Vol. XXIV, p. 398), 
and the other that ³the dictatorship of the proletariat 
is a special form of class alliance* between the proletariat, 
the vanguard of the working people, and the numerous 
non-proletarian strata of working people (the 
petty bourgeoisie, the small proprietors, the peasantry, 
the intelligentsia, etc.)² (Vol. XXIV, p. 311). 
Is there any contradiction between these two formulas? 
Of course not. How, then, is the power of one class 
(the proletariat) achieved when there is a class alliance 
with, say, the main mass of the peasantry? By 
carrying out in practice within this alliance the leading 
role of the proletariat (³the vanguard of the working 
people²), which is in power. The power of one class, 
the proletarian class, which is exercised with the help 
of an alliance of this class with the main mass of the peasantry 
by way of state leadership of the latter‹that 
is the underlying meaning of these two formulas. Where, 
then, is the contradiction? 
And what does state leadership of the main mass of 
the peasantry by the proletariat mean? Is it the sort 
of leadership which existed, for example, in the period 
of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, when we were 
striving for the dictatorship of the proletariat and the 
* My italics.‹J. St.

CONCERNING QUESTION OF WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ GOVERNMENT 189 
peasantry? No, not that sort of leadership. State leadership 
of the peasantry by the proletariat is leadership 
under the dictatorship of the proletariat. State leadership 
by the proletariat signifies that: 
a) the bourgeoisie has already been overthrown, 
b) the proletariat is in power, 
c) the proletariat does not share power with other 
classes, 
d) the proletariat is building socialism, and giving 
the lead to the main mass of the peasantry. 
Leadership by the proletariat at the time of the bourgeois-
democratic revolution and of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and peasantry signifies that: 
a) capitalism remains the foundation, 
b) the revolutionary-democratic bourgeoisie is in 
power and constitutes the predominant force in the 
government, 
c) the democratic bourgeoisie shares power with 
the proletariat, 
d) the proletariat is emancipating the peasantry 
from the influence of the bourgeois parties, leading it 
ideologically and politically, and preparing for a struggle 
for the overthrow of capitalism. 
The difference, as you see, is fundamental. 
The same must be said of the workers¹ and peasants¹ 
government. What contradiction can there be in the 
statement that the proletarian nature of our government, 
and the socialist objectives that follow therefrom, far 
from preventing, impel it, necessarily impel it to pursue 
a policy of preserving and strengthening the 
worker-peasant alliance as a cardinal means of achieving 
the socialist class objectives of the proletarian

J. V. S T A L I N 190 
dictatorship in our peasant country, and that this government 
is called a workers¹ and peasants¹ government 
because of this? 
Is it not obvious that Lenin was right in putting 
forward the slogan of a workers¹ and peasants¹ government 
and in describing our government as such a government? 
Generally speaking, it must be said that ³the system 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat²‹with the 
help of which the power of one class, of the proletariat, 
is exercised in our country‹is a fairly complex thing. 
I know that this complexity is displeasing, distasteful 
to some of our comrades. I know that many of them, on 
³the principle of the least expenditure of energy,² 
would prefer to have a simpler and easier system. But 
what can you do about it? In the first place, Leninism 
must be taken as it actually is (it must not be simplified 
and vulgarised); in the second place, history tells us 
that the simplest and easiest ³theories² are far from 
always being the most correct. 
4) In your letter, you complain: 
³All comrades who discuss this question sin in that they 
speak only of the government or only of the state, and therefore 
do not give a complete answer, since they leave entirely out of 
account what should be the relation between these concepts.² 
I must admit that our leading comrades are indeed 
guilty of this ³sin,² especially when it is remembered 
that certain not over-diligent ³readers² do not want 
to delve properly into the meaning of Lenin¹s works 
themselves and expect to have every sentence thoroughly 
masticated for them. But what can you do about

CONCERNING QUESTION OF WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ GOVERNMENT 191 
it? In the first place, our leading comrades are too busy, 
and overburdened with current work, which prevents 
them from busying themselves with explaining Leninism, 
so to say, point by point; in the second place, 
something, surely, must be left to the ³reader²‹who 
must, after all, pass from a light reading of Lenin¹s 
works to a serious study of Leninism. And it must be 
said that unless the ³reader² does make a serious study 
of Leninism, complaints like yours and ³misunderstandings² 
will always arise. 
Take, for example, the question of our state. It is 
obvious that, both in its class nature and in its programme, 
its fundamental tasks, its actions, its deeds, 
our state is a proletarian state, a workers¹ state‹true, 
with a certain ³bureaucratic distortion.² Recall Lenin¹s 
definition: 
³A workers¹ state is an abstraction. Actually, what we have 
is, firstly, a workers¹ state with the peculiarity that the population 
of our country is not predominantly working class, but peasant; 
and, secondly, a workers¹ state with a bureaucratic distortion² 
(Vol. XXVI, p. 91). 
Only Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and certain 
of our oppositionists are capable of doubting this. 
Lenin explained time and again that our state is the 
state of a proletarian dictatorship, and that proletarian 
dictatorship is the rule of one class, the rule of 
the proletariat. All this has long been known. Yet there 
are plenty of ³readers² who had and still have a grievance 
against Lenin because he sometimes called our 
state a ³workers¹ and peasants¹² state, although it should 
not be difficult to understand that in doing so Lenin

J. V. S T A L I N 192 
was not defining the class nature of our state, and still 
less denying its proletarian nature, but that what he 
had in mind was that the proletarian nature of the Soviet 
state necessitated a bond between the proletariat and 
the main mass of the peasantry, and, consequently, that 
the policy of the Soviet government must be directed 
to strengthening that bond. 
Take, for example, Vol. XXII, p. 174; Vol. XXV, 
pp. 50 and 80; Vol. XXVI, pp. 40, 67, 207, 216, and 
Vol. XXVII, p. 47. In all these works, and in certain 
others as well, Lenin describes our state as a ³workers¹ 
and peasants¹² state. But it would be strange not to 
realise that in all these instances Lenin is not describing 
the class nature of our state, but defining that policy 
of strengthening the bond which follows from 
the proletarian nature and socialist objectives of our 
state in the conditions of our peasant country. In this 
qualified and restricted sense, and in this sense alone, 
one may say that ours is a ³workers¹ and peasants¹² 
state, as Lenin does in the indicated passages in his 
works. 
As to the class nature of our state, I have already 
said that Lenin gave us a most precise formulation which 
does not permit of the slightest misconstruction‹namely: 
a workers¹ state, with a bureaucratic distortion, in 
a country with a predominantly peasant population. 
That, one would think, is clear. Nevertheless, certain 
³readers,² who are able to ³read² words but who refuse 
to understand what they read, continue to complain 
that Lenin has got them ³confused² about the nature 
of our state, and that his ³disciples² refuse to ³disentangle² 
the ³confusion.² That is rather funny. . . .

CONCERNING QUESTION OF WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ GOVERNMENT 193 
How are ³misunderstandings² to be removed, you 
will ask? 
There is only one way, in my opinion, and that is 
to study not isolated quotations from Lenin, but the 
substance of his works, and to study seriously, thoughtfully 
and assiduously. 
I see no other way.

LETTER TO SHINKEVICH 
I apologise for being late in replying. 
1) You refer to what Lenin said against vodka (see 
Vols. XXVI and XXVII42). The Party¹s Central Committee 
is familiar, of course, with what Lenin said. And 
if it agreed to introduce vodka, nevertheless, it was 
because it had Lenin¹s consent to this, given in 1922. 
Lenin did not consider it excluded that we might, 
with certain sacrifices on our part, arrive at a settlement 
on the debts with the bourgeois states and receive 
a substantial loan or substantial long-term credits. 
That was what he thought at the time of the Genoa Conference.
43 With such an arrangement, there would have 
been no need, of course, to introduce vodka. But as that 
arrangement did not materialise, and as we had no money 
for industry, and without a certain minimum of monetary 
funds we could not count upon any satisfactory development 
of our industry‹on the development of which 
the fate of our entire national economy depends‹we, 
along with Lenin, came to the conclusion that vodka 
would have to be introduced. 
Which was better: enslavement to foreign capital 
or introduction of vodka?‹that was the question that 
faced us. Naturally, we decided on vodka, because we 
considered, as we still consider, that if we had to dirty

LETTER TO SHINKEVICH 195 
our hands a little for the sake of the victory of the proletariat 
and the peasantry, we would resort even to this 
extreme expedient in the interests of our cause. 
The question came up for discussion in the Central 
Committee of our Party in October 1924. Some members 
of the Central Committee objected to the introduction 
of vodka, without, however, indicating the sources 
from which we could derive the funds needed for industry. 
In reply to this, seven C.C. members, myself among 
them, submitted the following statement to the plenum 
of the Central Committee: 
³In the summer of 1922 and the autumn of the same year 
(September), Comrade Lenin said several times to each of us 
that, since there was no hope of receiving a loan from abroad 
(failure of the Genoa Conference), it would be necessary to introduce 
a vodka monopoly, and that this was particularly necessary 
in order to create a minimum fund for the maintenance of the 
currency and the maintenance of industry. We consider it our 
duty to make a statement about all this in view of the fact that some 
comrades refer to earlier statements of Lenin on this subject.² 
The plenum of the Central Committee of our Party 
decided to introduce a vodka monopoly. 
2) As to your desire to ³maintain contact with me 
by correspondence,² I am prepared to meet your wish, 
and ask you to write on such subjects as may interest 
you. It is possible that I shall reply with some delay. 
But I shall certainly reply.

SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE FIFTH 
ALL-UNION CONFERENCE OF THE 
ALL-UNION LENINIST YOUNG 
COMMUNIST LEAGUE44 
March 29, 1927 
Comrades, permit me to greet you in the name of the 
Central Committee of our Party. (Applause.) 
Permit me to wish you success in your difficult work 
of organising and politically educating the workingclass 
and peasant youth of our country. 
The Young Communist League has always marched 
in the front ranks of our fighters. Let us hope that the 
Young Communist League will continue to be in the 
front ranks, bearing aloft and carrying forward the banner 
of socialism. (Applause.) 
And now, after these greetings, allow me to pass to 
two questions about which some of your comrades of the 
Young Communist League have just spoken to me. 
The first question is that of our industrial policy. 
That, so to speak, belongs to our home affairs. The second 
question is that of the Nanking events.45 That, consequently, 
is a matter of foreign affairs. 
Comrades, the basic line which our industry must 
follow, the basic line which must determine all its subsequent 
steps, is that of systematically reducing industrial 
production costs, that of systematically reducing 
wholesale prices of manufactured goods. That is the 
high road our industry must take if it is to develop and

SPEECH AT THE FIFTH ALL-UNION CONFERENCE OF LENINIST Y.C.L. 197 
grow strong, if it is to give the lead to agriculture, and 
if it is to strengthen and broaden the foundation of our 
socialist economy. 
What is the origin of this line? 
What are the causes that make this line necessary 
and expedient? 
There are, at least, four basic reasons which determine 
this line. 
The first reason is that an industry which is based 
upon high prices is not, and cannot be, a real industry, 
for it must inevitably degenerate into a hot-house plant 
that has not and cannot have any vitality. Only an industry 
that systematically reduces the prices of commodities, 
only an industry based on systematically reducing 
the costs of production, hence only an industry that 
systematically improves its methods of production, 
technical equipment and organisation of labour and 
its methods and forms of management‹only such an 
industry do we need, for it alone can go on developing, 
and it alone can guarantee the proletariat complete 
victory. 
The second reason is that our industry is based on 
the home market. We cannot, indeed we are unable, to 
compete with the capitalists in the foreign market. The 
home market is the basic market for our industry. But it 
follows from this that our industry can develop and grow 
strong only to the extent that our home market, its capacity, 
the mass demand for manufactured goods, develops 
and expands. And on what does the expansion of our 
home market, the enlargement of its capacity depend? It 
depends, among other things, on a systematic reduction 
of the prices of manufactured goods, that is, on that

J. V. S T A L I N 198 
basic line of development of our industry of which I 
have already spoken. 
The third reason is that unless prices of manufactured 
goods are reduced, unless manufactured goods 
are made systematically cheaper, it will be out of the 
question to preserve those conditions which are indispensable 
for a further rise of workers¹ wages. In the first 
place, the workers themselves are consumers of manufactured 
goods, in view of which a reduction of the 
prices of these goods cannot but be of substantial importance 
for maintaining and raising real wages. In the 
second place, on a reduction of the prices of manufactured 
goods depends the stability of the prices of the agricultural 
produce consumed in the towns, principally 
by the workers, which likewise cannot but be of substantial 
importance for maintaining and raising real 
wages. Can our socialist state refrain from systematically 
increasing the wages of the workers? No, it cannot. 
But it follows from this that a systematic reduction of 
the prices of manufactured goods is one of the essential 
prerequisites for a progressive rise in the standard of 
living of the working class. 
The fourth and last reason is that, unless prices of 
manufactured goods are reduced, we cannot preserve 
that bond between the proletariat and the peasantry, 
between industry and peasant economy, which is the 
basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country. 
You know that the peasant is paying too much for manufactured 
goods, for textiles, machines, etc. You know 
that this is a cause of serious discontent among the peasantry 
and hinders the progress of agriculture. And 
what follows from this? The only thing that follows is

SPEECH AT THE FIFTH ALL-UNION CONFERENCE OF LENINIST Y.C.L. 199 
that we must pursue a policy of systematically reducing 
prices of manufactured goods, if we really want to preserve 
the bond, the alliance between the working class 
and the peasantry, and to promote the development of 
agriculture. 
But what is required to make the policy of reducing industrial 
production costs and wholesale prices of commodities 
possible and quite practicable? For that it is 
essential to have a radical improvement of the technology 
of production, a radical improvement of the organisation 
of labour in the factories, a radical improvement and 
simplification of the entire economic apparatus and a determined 
fight against bureaucracy in this apparatus. 
All this is what we call socialist rationalisation of production 
and of the management of economy. Our industry 
has entered a phase of development when a substantial 
increase of the productivity of labour and a systematic 
reduction of industrial production costs are becoming 
impossible unless new and better technical equipment 
is introduced, unless a new and better organisation of 
labour is introduced, and unless our economic apparatus 
is simplified and made cheaper. We need all this not 
only in order to raise labour productivity and reduce 
the prices of manufactured goods, but also in order that 
the resulting economies may be used for the further 
development and expansion of our industry. That is 
why we need socialist rationalisation of production and of 
the management of economy. 
We thus get a chain: we cannot develop industry 
further unless we systematically reduce industrial production 
costs and wholesale prices; but it is impossible 
to reduce prices of manufactured goods unless we

J. V. S T A L I N 200 
introduce new technical equipment, new forms of the 
organisation of labour and new simplified managerial 
methods. Hence the question of socialist rationalisation 
of production and of the management of economy is one 
of the decisive questions of the day. 
That is why I think that the recent decision of our 
Party¹s Central Committee on rationalisation of production 
and of the management of economy46 is one of 
the most important decisions of our Party, one that 
determines our industrial policy for the period immediately 
ahead. 
It is said that rationalisation entails certain temporary 
sacrifices on the part of certain groups of workers, 
including the youth. That is true, comrades. 
The history of our revolution tells us that not a 
single important step has been taken which did not involve 
certain sacrifices on the part of individual groups 
of the working class in the interests of the whole working 
class of our country. Take, for instance, the Civil 
War, although the present inconsiderable sacrifices will 
not bear any comparison with the serious sacrifices that 
were made during the Civil War. You see that we are 
already being compensated with interest for those sacrifices. 
It scarcely needs proof that the present inconsiderable 
sacrifices will be more than compensated for in 
the near future. That is why I think that we should not 
hesitate to make certain inconsiderable sacrifices in 
the interests of the working class as a whole. 
The Young Communist League has always been in 
the front ranks of our fighters. I know of no instance 
when it has lagged behind the developments in our revo

SPEECH AT THE FIFTH ALL-UNION CONFERENCE OF LENINIST Y.C.L. 201 
lutionary life. I do not doubt that now, too, in carrying 
out socialist rationalisation, the Young Communist 
League will take its due place. (Applause.) 
Permit me now to pass to the second question‹that 
of the Nanking events. I think that the Nanking events 
should not have come as a surprise to us. Imperialism 
cannot live without violence and robbery, without bloodshed 
and shooting. That is the nature of imperialism. 
The events in Nanking cannot, therefore, be a surprise 
to us. 
What do the Nanking events indicate? 
What is their political meaning? 
They indicate a turn in the policy of imperialism, 
a turn from armed peace to armed war against the 
Chinese people. 
Before the Nanking events, imperialism endeavoured 
to hide its intentions by unctuous talk about peace 
and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other 
countries, by a mask of ³civilisation² and ³humanitarianism,² 
the League of Nations and so forth. After the 
Nanking events, imperialism is discarding its unctuous 
speeches, its talk of non-intervention, the League of 
Nations and all the other masks. Now imperialism stands 
exposed to the eyes of the world in all its nakedness as an 
avowed plunderer and oppressor. 
Bourgeois pacifism has sustained another telling 
blow. For what, indeed, have those who sing the praises 
of imperialist pacifism, such as the Boncours, the Breitscheids 
and others, to oppose to the fact of the massacre 
of Nanking inhabitants except their false pacifist talk? 
The League of Nations has been given another slap 
in the face. For who but lackeys of imperialism can

J. V. S T A L I N 202 
consider it ³normal² that one member of the League of 
Nations massacres the citizens of another member, while 
the League of Nations itself is compelled to keep silent 
and assume that the matter does not concern it? 
It is now proved that our Party was right when it 
assessed the dispatch of troops to Shanghai by the imperialist 
countries as the prelude to armed attacks on the 
Chinese people. For one must be blind not to see now 
that imperialism needed troops in Shanghai in order to 
pass from ³words² to ³deeds.² 
Such is the meaning of the Nanking events. 
What could have been the intentions of the imperialists 
in risking the Nanking gamble? 
It is possible that by stripping off their mask 
and having recourse to their artillery in Nanking, 
the imperialists wanted to turn back the wheel of 
history, to put an end to the growing revolutionary 
movement in all countries, and to undertake a fight for 
the restoration of that relative stability of world capitalism 
which existed before the imperialist war. 
We know that capitalism emerged from the imperialist 
war with incurable wounds. 
We know that ten years ago the workers and peasants 
of the U.S.S.R. breached the front of capital and inflicted 
an incurable wound on it. 
We know that the imperialist war shook the foundations 
of imperialist rule in the colonies and dependent 
countries. 
We know that, ten years after October, the Chinese 
workers and peasants have also begun to breach the imperialist 
front, and there is no reason to assume that they 
will not finally breach it.

SPEECH AT THE FIFTH ALL-UNION CONFERENCE OF LENINIST Y.C.L. 203 
Well then, it is possible that the imperialists 
wanted to wipe out all this at one stroke and begin a 
³new page² of history. And if that is what they really 
wanted, it has to be admitted that they have missed the 
mark. For one must be in one¹s dotage to think that the 
laws of artillery are stronger than the laws of history, 
that the wheel of history can be turned back by the 
firing in Nanking. 
It is possible that when the imperialists bombarded 
Nanking they wanted to intimidate the oppressed peoples 
of other countries who are straining for liberty, as though 
to say: The Nanking affair is meant for your benefit. 
That is by no means excluded, comrades. The policy 
of intimidation has its ³grounds² in the history of imperialism. 
But that this policy is unsuitable and is not 
achieving its purpose is hardly to be doubted. It was 
applied ³with success² by Russian tsarism in its day. 
But how did it end? You know that it ended in the complete 
collapse of tsarism. 
It is possible, lastly, that in bombarding Nanking 
the imperialists wanted to strike at the very heart of 
the Chinese revolution and to make impossible, firstly, 
the further advance of the South Chinese troops and the 
unification of China, and, secondly, the carrying out of 
the terms of the concessions negotiations held in Hankow. 
That is quite possible and, perhaps, quite probable. That 
the imperialists do not want a united China and prefer 
to have two Chinas in order to be able to ³manoeuvre 
more effectively² has been blurted out by the capitalist 
press more than once. As to the Shanghai and other concessions, 
there is scarcely room for doubt that many 
of the imperialists ³do not sympathise² with the terms

J. V. S T A L I N 204 
which were worked out and endorsed in Hankow. And 
so, in bombarding Nanking the imperialists evidently 
wanted to make it known that they preferred in future 
to negotiate with the national government under pressure 
and to the accompaniment of artillery fire. Such 
indeed is the musical taste of the imperialists. That 
this strange music smacks of the music of cannibals is 
something which apparently does not disturb the imperialists. 
Whether they will achieve their aim, the near future 
will show. It should be observed, however, that so 
far they have achieved only one thing, and that is to 
intensify the hatred of imperialism among the Chinese, 
to unite the forces of the Kuomintang,47 and to swing 
the revolutionary movement in China further to the 
Left. 
There can scarcely be any doubt that so far the results 
are the opposite of what was expected. 
It turns out, then, that in bombarding Nanking the 
imperialists were striving for one thing, but what actually 
happened was something else, moreover something 
the very opposite of what they were striving for. 
Such are the results and perspectives of the Nanking 
events. 
Such is the policy of the wiseacres of the conservative 
camp. 
Not without reason is it said: whom the gods wish 
to destroy they first make mad. (Stormy and prolonged 
applause.)

LETTER TO CHUGUNOV 
I am extremely late in replying. My apologies. 
1) The criticism of Sun Yat-sen that Lenin gave in 
191248 is, of course, not out-of-date and retains its validity. 
But it was a criticism of the old Sun Yat-sen. 
Sun Yat-sen, after all, did not remain at a stand-still. 
He went on developing, just as everything in the world 
develops. After October, and especially in 1920-21, 
Lenin had a great respect for Sun Yat-sen, chiefly because 
Sun Yat-sen began to draw closer to the Chinese 
Communists and to co-operate with them. This circumstance 
must be borne in mind when speaking of Lenin 
and Sun Yat-senism. Does this mean that Sun Yat-sen 
was a Communist? No, it does not. The difference between 
Sun Yat-senism and communism (Marxism) remains. 
If, nevertheless, the Chinese Communists cooperate 
with the Kuomintangists within one party, the 
Kuomintang party, the reason is that Sun Yat-sen¹s three 
principles‹Democracy, Nationality, Socialism‹constitute 
a fully acceptable basis for joint work of Communists 
and Sun Yat-senists within the Kuomintang party at 
the present stage of development of the Chinese revolution. 
The argument that at one time Russia was also on 
the eve of a bourgeois-democratic revolution, yet the

J. V. S T A L I N 206 
Communists and the Socialist-Revolutionaries did not 
belong to one common party, is devoid of all foundation. 
The point is that Russia at that time was not a nationally 
oppressed country (she herself was not averse to 
oppressing other nations), in consequence of which there 
was in Russia no powerful national factor to draw the 
revolutionary forces of the country together into one 
camp; whereas in present-day China the national factor 
not only exists, but is the predominating factor (the struggle 
against the imperialist oppressors) determining the 
character of the relations between the revolutionary 
forces of China within the Kuomintang. 
2) In my report at the Fourteenth Congress49 not a 
single word is said about ³concessions to Japan,² and, 
what is more, ³at the expense of China.² That is not 
being serious, Comrade Chugunov! All I spoke of was 
friendly relations with Japan. And what is meant by 
friendly relations from the diplomatic standpoint? It 
means that we do not want war with Japan, that we stand 
for a policy of peace. 
3) As to the ambiguous policy of the United States, 
its ambiguity is so transparent and unmistakable as to 
need no explanation. 
With communist greetings, 
J. Stalin

THE PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL 
SLOGANS ON THE PEASANT QUESTION 
Reply to Yan‹sky 
I duly received your letter, of course. I am replying 
after some delay, for which please forgive me. 
1) Lenin says that ³the main question of every revolution 
is the question of state power² (see Vol. XXI, p. 142). 
In the hands of which class, or which classes, is power concentrated; 
which class, or which classes, must be overthrown; 
which class, or which classes, must take power‹ 
such is ³the main question of every revolution.² 
The Party¹s fundamental strategic slogans, which 
retain their validity during the whole period of any particular 
stage of the revolution, cannot be called fundamental 
slogans if they are not wholly and entirely based 
on this cardinal thesis of Lenin¹s. 
Fundamental slogans can be correct only if they are 
based on a Marxist analysis of class forces, if they indicate 
the correct plan of disposition of the revolutionary 
forces on the front of the class struggle, if they help 
to bring the masses to the front of the struggle for 
the victory of the revolution, to the front of the struggle 
for the seizure of power by the new class, if they 
help the Party to form from the broad masses of the people 
the large and powerful political army which is essential 
for the fulfilment of this task.

J. V. S T A L I N 208 
During any particular stage of the revolution there 
may occur defeats and retreats, failures and tactical 
errors, but that does not mean that the fundamental strategic 
slogan is wrong. Thus, for instance, the fundamental 
slogan at the first stage of our revolution‹³together 
with the whole of the peasantry, against the tsar 
and the landlords, while neutralising the bourgeoisie, 
for the victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution²‹ 
was an absolutely correct slogan, in spite of the fact 
that the Revolution of 1905 suffered defeat. 
Consequently, the question of the fundamental slogan 
of the Party must not be confused with the question of 
the successes or failures of the revolution at any particular 
stage of its development. 
It may happen that in the course of the revolution 
the fundamental slogan of the Party has already led to 
the overthrow of the power of the old classes, or of the 
old class, but a number of vital demands of the revolution, 
arising out of that slogan, have not been achieved, 
or their achievement has been spread over a whole period 
of time, or a new revolution may be required for their 
achievement; but this does not mean that the fundamental 
slogan was wrong. Thus, for instance, the February Revolution 
of 1917 overthrew tsardom and the landlords, but 
did not lead to the confiscation of the landlords¹ land, 
etc.; but this does not mean that our fundamental slogan 
at the first stage of the revolution was wrong. 
Or another example: The October Revolution overthrew 
the bourgeoisie and transferred power to the proletariat, 
but did not immediately lead to: a) the completion 
of the bourgeois revolution, in general, and b) the isolation 
of the kulaks in the countryside, in particular‹

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 209 
these were spread over a certain period of time; but 
this does not mean that our fundamental slogan at the 
second stage of the revolution‹³together with the poor 
peasantry, against capitalism in town and country, while 
neutralising the middle peasantry, for the power of the 
proletariat²‹was wrong. 
Consequently, the question of the fundamental slogan 
of the Party must not be confused with the question 
of the time and forms of achieving particular demands 
arising out of that slogan. 
That is why the strategic slogans of our Party must 
not be appraised from the point of view of episodical 
successes or defeats of the revolutionary movement in 
any particular period; still less can they be appraised 
from the point of view of the time or forms of achieving 
any particular demands that arise out of those slogans. 
The strategic slogans of the Party can be appraised only 
from the point of view of a Marxist analysis of the class 
forces and of the correct disposition of the revolutionary 
forces on the front of the struggle for the victory 
of the revolution, for the concentration of power in the 
hands of the new class. 
Your error consists in overlooking this extremely 
important methodological question, or not understanding 
it. 
2) You write in your letter: 
³Is i t correct to assert that we were in alliance with the 
whole of the peasantry only up to October? No, it is not. The 
slogan ŒAlliance with the whole of the peasantry¹ was valid before 
October, during October and in the first period after October, 
inasmuch as the whole of the peasantry was interested in completing, 
the bourgeois revolution.²

J. V. S T A L I N 210 
Thus, from this quotation it follows that the strategic 
slogan of the Party at the first stage of the revolution 
(1905 to February 1917), when the task was to 
overthrow the power of the tsar and the landlords and 
to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat and the 
peasantry, did not differ from the strategic slogan at 
the second stage of the revolution (February 1917 to 
October 1917), when the task was to overthrow the power 
of the bourgeoisie and to establish the dictatorship of 
the proletariat. 
Consequently, you deny the fundamental difference 
between the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the 
proletarian-socialist revolution. You commit this error 
because, evidently, you refuse to understand so simple 
a matter as that the fundamental theme of a strategic 
slogan is the question of power at the particular stage of 
the revolution, the question as to which class is being 
overthrown and into the hands of which class power is 
being transferred. It scarcely needs proof that on this 
point you are radically wrong. 
You say that at the time of October and in the first 
period after October we applied the slogan, ³Alliance 
with the whole of the peasantry,² inasmuch as the whole 
peasantry was interested in completing the bourgeois 
revolution. But who told you that the October uprising 
and the October Revolution were confined to, or took as 
their main task, the completion of the bourgeois revolution? 
Where did you get that from? Is it possible for 
the overthrow of the power of the bourgeoisie and the 
establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat to 
be effected within the framework of the bourgeois revolution? 
Does not the achievement of the dictatorship

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 211 
of the proletariat mean going beyond the framework of 
the bourgeois revolution? 
How can it be asserted that the kulaks (who, of 
course, are also peasants) could support the overthrow 
of the bourgeoisie and the transfer of power to the proletariat? 
How can it be denied that the decree on the nationalisation 
of the land, the abolition of private ownership 
of land, the prohibition of the purchase and sale of 
land, etc., in spite of the fact that it cannot be regarded 
as a socialist decree, was put into effect by us in a struggle 
against the kulaks, and not in alliance with them? 
How can it be asserted that the kulaks (who are also 
peasants) could support the decrees of the Soviet government 
on the expropriation of mills, factories, railways, 
banks, etc., or the slogan of the proletariat on transforming 
the imperialist war into a civil war? 
How can it be asserted that the fundamental thing 
in October was not these and similar acts, not the overthrow 
of the bourgeoisie and the establishment of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, but the completion of 
the bourgeois revolution? 
No one denies that one of the main tasks of the 
October Revolution was to complete the bourgeois revolution, 
that without the October Revolution it could not 
have been completed, just as the October Revolution itself 
could not have been consolidated without completing 
the bourgeois revolution; and since the October Revolution 
did complete the bourgeois revolution it was bound 
to meet with the sympathy of all the peasants. All that 
is undeniable. But can it be asserted on these grounds 
that the completion of the bourgeois revolution was not

J. V. S T A L I N 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
212 
a derivative phenomenon in the course of the October 
Revolution but its essence or its principal aim? What 
then, according to you, has become of the principal aim 
of the October Revolution, namely, the overthrow of the 
power of the bourgeoisie, the establishment of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat, the transformation of the 
imperialist war into a civil war, the expropriation of 
the capitalists, etc.? 
And if the main theme of a strategic slogan is the 
fundamental question of every revolution, i.e., the question 
of the transfer of power from one class to another 
class, is it not clear from this that the question of the 
completion of the bourgeois revolution by the proletarian 
power must not be confused with the question of 
overthrowing the bourgeoisie and achieving this proletarian 
power, i.e., with the question that is the main 
theme of the strategic slogan at the second stage of the 
revolution? 
One of the greatest achievements of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat is that it completed the bourgeois 
revolution and swept away all the filth of medievalism. 
For the countryside that was of supreme and indeed decisive 
importance. Without it the combination of peasant 
wars with the proletarian revolution, of which Marx 
spoke in the second half of the past century,50 could not 
have been brought about. Without it, the proletarian 
revolution itself could not have been consolidated. 
Moreover, the following important circumstance must 
be borne in mind. The completion of the bourgeois revolution 
cannot be accomplished at one stroke. Actually, 
it was spread over a whole period embracing not only 
parts of 1918, as you assert in your letter, but also

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 213 
parts of 1919 (the Volga area and the Urals) and of 
1919-20 (the Ukraine). I am referring to the advance of 
Kolchak and Denikin, when the peasantry as a whole was 
faced with the danger of the restoration of the power of 
the landlords and when the peasantry, precisely as a 
whole, was compelled to rally around the Soviet power 
in order to ensure the completion of the bourgeois revolution 
and to retain the fruits of that revolution. This 
complexity and diversity of the processes of living reality, 
this ³odd² interweaving of the directly socialist 
tasks of the proletarian dictatorship with the task 
of completing the bourgeois revolution, must always 
be kept in mind in order correctly to understand the 
passages you quote from the works of Lenin and 
the mechanics of putting the Party¹s slogans into 
effect. 
Can it be said that this interweaving indicates that 
the Party¹s slogan at the second stage of the revolution 
was wrong, and that this slogan did not differ from the 
slogan at the first stage of the revolution? No, it cannot. 
On the contrary, this interweaving merely confirms the 
correctness of the Party¹s slogan at the second stage of the 
revolution: Together with the poor peasantry, against the 
capitalist bourgeoisie in town and country, for the power 
of the proletariat, etc. Why? Because in order to complete 
the bourgeois revolution it was necessary in October first 
to overthrow the power of the bourgeoisie and to set up 
the power of the proletariat, for only such a power is 
capable of completing the bourgeois revolution. But in 
order to set up the power of the proletariat in October 
it was essential to prepare and organise for October 
the appropriate political army, an army capable of

J. V. S T A L I N 214 
overthrowing the bourgeoisie and of establishing the 
power of the proletariat; and there is no need to prove 
that such a political army could be prepared and organised 
by us only under the slogan: Alliance of the proletariat 
with the poor peasantry against the bourgeoisie, 
for the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
It is clear that without such a strategic slogan, which 
we carried through from April 1917 until October 1917, 
we could not have had such a political army, and that, 
therefore, we could not have triumphed in October, 
we would not have overthrown the power of the bourgeoisie 
and, consequently, we would not have been able 
to complete the bourgeois revolution. 
That is why the completion of the bourgeois revolution 
must not be counterposed to the strategic slogan at 
the second stage of the revolution, a slogan which had 
the task of ensuring the seizure of power by the proletariat. 
There is only one way to avoid all these ³contradictions,² 
namely, to recognise the fundamental difference 
between the strategic slogan of the first stage of the revolution 
(the bourgeois-democratic revolution) and the 
strategic slogan of the second stage of the revolution 
(the proletarian revolution), to recognise that during 
the first stage of the revolution we marched together 
with the whole of the peasantry for the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution, whereas during the second stage of the 
revolution we marched together with the poor peasantry 
against the power of capital and for the proletarian revolution. 
And this must be recognised because an analysis of 
the class forces at the first and second stages of the rev

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 215 
olution obliges us to do so. Otherwise i t would be 
impossible to explain the fact that until February 1917 we 
carried on our work under the slogan of a revolutionarydemocratic 
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, 
while after February 1917 this slogan was replaced 
by the slogan of the socialist dictatorship of 
the proletariat and poor peasantry. 
You will agree that this replacement of one slogan 
by an other in March-April 1917 cannot be explained 
under your scheme. 
This fundamental difference between the two strategic 
slogans of the Party was already pointed out by Lenin 
in his pamphlet Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in 
the Democratic Revolution. He formulated the Party¹s 
slogan in preparing for the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
as follows: 
³The proletariat must carry to completion the democratic 
revolution, by allying to itself the mass of the peasantry in order 
to crush by force the resistance of the autocracy and to paralyse 
the instability of the bourgeoisie² (see Vol. VIII, p. 96). 
In other words: with the whole of the peasantry, 
against the autocracy, while neutralising the bourgeoisie‹
for a democratic revolution. 
As to the Party¹s slogan in the period of preparation 
for the socialist revolution, he formulated it as 
follows: 
³The proletariat must accomplish the socialist revolution, 
by allying to itself the mass of the semi-proletarian elements of 
the population in order to crush by force the resistance of the bourgeoisie 
and to paralyse the instability of the peasantry and the 
petty bourgeoisie² (ibid.).

J. V. S T A L I N 216 
In other words: together with the poor peasantry and 
the semi-proletarian strata of the population in general, 
against the bourgeoisie, while neutralising the petty bourgeoisie 
in town and country, for the socialist revolution. 
That was in 1905. 
In April 1917, Lenin, characterising the political 
situation at that time as the interweaving of the revolutionary-
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and 
peasantry with the actual power of the bourgeoisie, 
said: 
³The specific feature of the present situation in Russia consists 
in the transition from the first* stage of the revolution‹ 
which, owing to the insufficient class consciousness and organisation 
of the proletariat, placed the power in the hands of the bourgeoisie‹
to the second stage, which must place the power in the 
hands of the proletariat and the poor strata* of the peasantry² 
(see Lenin¹s April Theses‹Vol. XX, p. 88). 
At the end of August 1917, when the preparations 
for the October Revolution were in full swing, Lenin, 
in a special article entitled ³Peasants and Workers,² 
wrote as follows: 
³Only the proletariat and the peasantry* can overthrow the 
monarchy‹such was the fundamental definition of our class 
policy for that time (i.e., 1905‹J. St.). And that definition 
was a correct one. February and March 1917 have confirmed 
this once again. Only the proletariat, leading the poor peasantry* 
(the semi-proletarians, as our programme says), can end the 
war by a democratic peace, heal the wounds it has caused, and 
begin to take steps towards socialism, which have become 
absolutely essential and urgent‹such is the definition of our class 
policy now² (see Vol. XXI, p. 111). 
* My italics.‹J. St.

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 217 
That must not be understood to mean that we now 
have a dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry. 
That, of course, is not so. We marched towards 
October under the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
and poor peasantry, and in October we put 
it into effect formally inasmuch as we had a bloc with 
the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and shared the leadership 
with them, although actually the dictatorship of the 
proletariat already existed, since we Bolsheviks constituted 
the majority. The dictatorship of the proletariat 
and poor peasantry ceased to exist formally, however, 
after the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries¹ ³putsch,²51 
after the rupture of the bloc with the Left Socialist- 
Revolutionaries, when the leadership passed wholly and 
entirely into the hands of one party, into the hands of 
our Party, which does not and cannot share the 
leadership of the state with another party. That is 
what we call the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Finally, in November 1918, Lenin, casting a retrospective 
glance at the path the revolution had travelled, 
wrote: 
³Yes, our revolution is a bourgeois revolution so long as we 
march with the peasantry as a whole. This has been as clear as 
clear can be to us; we have said it hundreds and thousands of 
times since 1905, and we have never attempted to skip this necessary 
stage of the historical process or abolish it by decrees. . . . 
But in 1917, beginning with April, long before the October Revolution, 
before we seized* power, we publicly declared and explained 
to the people: The revolution cannot now stop at this stage, 
for the country has gone forward, capitalism has advanced, ruin 
has reached unprecedented dimensions, which (whether one likes 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 218 
it or not) will demand steps forward, to socialism; for there is no 
other way of advancing, of saving the country, which is racked by 
war, and of alleviating the sufferings of the toilers and exploited. 
Things turned out just as we said they would. The course 
taken by the revolution confirmed the correctness of our reasoning. 
First, with the Œwhole¹ of the peasantry against the 
monarchy, against the landlords, against the mediaeval regime 
(and to that extent the revolution remains bourgeois, bourgeoisdemocratic). 
Then, with the poor peasantry, with the 
semi-proletarians, with all the exploited, against capitalism, 
including the rural rich, the kulaks, the profiteers,* and to 
that extent the revolution becomes a socialist one² (see Vol . 
XXIII, pp. 390-91). 
As you see, Lenin repeatedly emphasised the profound 
difference between the first strategic slogan, 
in the period of preparation for the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution, and the second strategic slogan, in 
the period of preparation for October. The first slogan 
was: With the whole of the peasantry, against the autocracy; 
the second: With the poor peasantry, against the 
bourgeoisie. 
The fact that the completion of the bourgeois revolution 
was spread over a whole period after October and 
that, inasmuch as we were completing the bourgeois 
revolution, the ³whole² of the peasantry could 
not but sympathise with us‹this fact, as I said above, 
does not in the least shake the fundamental thesis that 
we marched towards October and achieved victory in 
October together with the poor peasantry, that we overthrew 
the power of the bourgeoisie and established 
the dictatorship of the proletariat (one of the tasks of 
* My italics.‹J. St.

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 219 
which was to complete the bourgeois revolution) together 
with the poor peasantry, against the resistance of the 
kulaks (also peasants) and with the middle peasantry 
vacillating. 
That is clear, I think. 
3) You write further in your letter: 
³Is the assertion true that Œwe arrived at October under the 
slogan of alliance with the rural poor, while neutralising the middle 
peasant¹? No it is not true. For the reasons mentioned above, and 
from the quotations from Lenin, it will be seen that this slogan 
could arise only when Œthe class division among the peasantry 
had matured¹ (Lenin), i.e., Œin the summer and autumn of 1918.¹² 
From this quotation it follows that the Party adopted 
the policy of neutralising the middle peasant, not in 
the period of preparation for October and during October, 
but after October, and particularly after 1918, subsequent 
to the Poor Peasants¹ Committees. That is quite 
wrong. 
On the contrary, the policy of neutralising the middle 
peasant did not begin, but ended subsequent to the Committees 
of Poor Peasants, after 1918. The policy of neutralising 
the middle peasant was abolished (and not introduced) 
in our practical work after 1918. It was after 1918, in 
March 1919, that Lenin, opening the Eighth Congress 
of our Party, stated: 
³. . . The best representatives of socialism of the old days‹when 
they still believed in revolution and served it theoretically and 
ideologically‹spoke of neutralising the peasantry, i.e., of turning 
the middle peasantry into a social stratum which, if it did not 
actively aid the revolution of the proletariat, at least would not 
hinder it, would be neutral and not take the side of our enemies. 
This abstract, theoretical presentation of the problem is perfectly

J. V. S T A L I N 220 
clear to us. But it is not enough.* We have entered a phase of 
socialist construction* in which we must draw up concrete and 
detailed basic rules and instructions which have been tested by the 
experience of our work in the countryside, and by which we must be 
guided in order to achieve a stable alliance with the middle peasantry² 
(see Vol. XXIV, p. 114). 
As you see, this amounts to the very opposite of 
what you say in your letter; you turn our actual Party 
practice upside down by confusing the beginning of neutralisation 
with its end. 
The middle peasant whined and wavered between revolution 
and counter-revolution while the bourgeoisie was 
being overthrown and while the power of the Soviets was 
not consolidated, therefore it was necessary to neutralise 
him. The middle peasant began to turn towards us when he 
began to be convinced that the bourgeoisie had been overthrown 
³for good,² that the power of the Soviets was being 
consolidated, that the kulak was being overcome and that 
the Red Army was beginning to achieve victory on the 
fronts of the Civil War. And it was precisely after this 
turning point that the third strategic slogan of the Party, 
issued by Lenin at the Eighth Party Congress, became 
possible, namely: while relying on the poor peasants and 
establishing a stable alliance with the middle peasants‹ 
forward to socialist construction! 
How could you forget this well-known fact? 
From your letter it also follows that the policy of 
neutralising the middle peasant during the transition 
to the proletarian revolution and in the first days after 
the victory of that revolution is wrong, unsuitable and

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 221 
therefore unacceptable. That is quite wrong. The very 
opposite is the case. It is precisely while the power 
of the bourgeoisie is being overthrown and before the 
power of the proletariat has been consolidated that the 
middle peasant wavers and resists most of all. It is 
precisely in this period that alliance with the poor peasant 
and neutralisation of the middle peasant are necessary. 
Persisting in your error, you assert that the question 
of the peasantry is very important, not only for our 
country, but also for other countries ³which more or less 
resemble the economic system of pre-October Russia.² 
This latter statement is, of course, true. But here is what 
Lenin said in his theses on the agrarian question at the 
Second Congress of the Comintern52 regarding the policy 
of proletarian parties towards the middle peasant in the 
period when the proletariat is taking power. After defining 
the poor peasantry, or more precisely, ³the toiling 
and exploited masses in the countryside,² as a separate 
group consisting of agricultural labourers, semi-proletarians, 
or allotment holders and small peasants, and then 
passing to the question of the middle peasantry as a separate 
group in the countryside, Lenin says: 
³By Œmiddle peasants¹ in the economic sense are meant small 
cultivators who also hold, either as owners or tenants, small plots 
of land, but such as, firstly, under capitalism, provide them as 
a general rule not only with a meagre upkeep for their families and 
households, but also with the possibility of securing a certain surplus, 
which, at least in the better years, may be converted into capital; 
and, secondly, fairly frequently (for example, one farm out of 
two or three) involve resort to the hire of outside labour. . . . The revoutionary 
proletariat cannot set itself the task‹at least in the immediate 
future and in the initial period of the dictatorship of the

J. V. S T A L I N 222 
proletariat‹of winning over this stratum, but must confine itself 
to the task of neutralising it, i.e., making it neutral in the struggle 
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie²* (see Vol . XXV, 
pp. 271-72). 
How, after this, can it be asserted that the policy 
of neutralising the middle peasant ³arose² in our country 
³only² ³in the summer and autumn of 1918,² i.e., after 
the decisive successes achieved in consolidating, the 
power of the Soviets, the power of the proletariat? 
As you see, the question of the strategic slogan of 
proletarian parties at the moment of transition to the 
socialist revolution and the consolidation of the power 
of the proletariat, as also the question of the neutralisation 
of the middle peasant, is not as simple as you 
imagine. 
4) From all that has been said above, it is evident 
that the passages from the works of Lenin you quote can 
in no way be counterposed to the fundamental slogan of 
the Party at the second stage of the revolution, since 
these quotations: a) deal not with the fundamental slogan 
of the Party before October, but with the completion of 
the bourgeois revolution after October, and b) do not refute, 
but confirm the correctness of that slogan. 
I have already said above, and I must repeat, that 
the strategic slogan of the Party at the second stage of 
the revolution, in the period before the seizure of power 
by the proletariat, the main theme of which is the question 
of power, must not be counterposed to the task of 
completing the bourgeois revolution which is effected 
in the period after the proletariat has taken power. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

PARTY¹S THREE FUNDAMENTAL SLOGANS 223 
5) You speak of Comrade Molotov¹s article in Pravda 
entitled ³The Bourgeois Revolution in Our Country² 
(March 12, 1927), which, it appears, ³induced² you to 
apply to me for an explanation. I do not know how you 
read articles. I, too, have read Comrade Molotov¹s article 
and I think that it does not in any way contradict what 
I said in my report at the Fourteenth Congress of our 
Party on our Party¹s slogans regarding the peasantry.53 
In his article, Comrade Molotov does not deal with 
the Party¹s fundamental slogan in the period of October, 
but with the fact that, since the Party after October 
completed the bourgeois revolution, it enjoyed the sympathy 
of all the peasants. But I have already said above 
that the statement of this fact does not refute, but, on 
the contrary, confirms the correctness of the fundamental 
thesis that we overthrew the power of the bourgeoisie 
and established the dictatorship of the proletariat 
together with the poor peasantry, while neutralising 
the middle peasant, against the bourgeoisie of town 
and country; that without this we could not have 
completed the bourgeois revolution.

PROSPECTS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 
Basic factors determining the character of the Chinese 
revolution: 
a) the semi-colonial status of China and the financial 
and economic domination of imperialism; 
b) the oppression of feudal survivals, aggravated by 
the oppression of militarism and bureaucracy; 
c) the growing revolutionary struggle of the vast 
masses of the workers and peasants against feudal and 
bureaucratic oppression, against militarism, and against 
imperialism; 
d) the political weakness of the national bourgeoisie, 
its dependence on imperialism, its fear of the sweep 
of the revolutionary movement; 
e) the growing revolutionary activity of the proletariat, 
its mounting prestige among the vast masses of 
the working people; 
f) the existence of a proletarian dictatorship in the 
neighbourhood of China.

QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 225 
Hence, two paths for the development of events in 
China: 
either the national bourgeoisie smashes the proletariat, 
makes a deal with imperialism and together with it 
launches a campaign against the revolution in order to 
end the latter by establishing the rule of capitalism; 
or the proletariat pushes aside the national bourgeoisie, 
consolidates its hegemony and assumes the lead of 
the vast masses of the working people in town and country, 
in order to overcome the resistance of the national 
bourgeoisie, secure the complete victory of the bourgeoisdemocratic 
revolution, and then gradually convert it 
into a socialist revolution, with all the consequences 
following from that. 
One or the other. 
The crisis of world capitalism and the existence in 
the U.S.S.R. of a proletarian dictatorship whose experience 
may be successfully utilised by the Chinese proletariat 
considerably enhance the possibility of the 
Chinese revolution taking the second path. 
On the other hand, the fact that imperialism is attacking 
the Chinese revolution, in the main with a united 
front, that there is not at the present time that division 
and war among the imperialists which, for instance, 
existed in the imperialist camp prior to the October 
Revolution, and which tended to weaken imperialism 
‹this fact indicates that on its path to victory the 
Chinese revolution will encounter far greater difficulties 
than did the revolution in Russia, and that the desertions 
and betrayals in the course of this revolution will 
be incomparably more numerous than during the Civil 
War in the U.S.S.R.

J. V. S T A L I N 226 
Hence, the struggle between these two paths of the 
revolution constitutes the characteristic feature of the 
Chinese revolution. 
Precisely for this reason, the basic task of the 
Communists is to fight for the victory of the second 
path of development of the Chinese revolution. 
II 
THE FIRST STAGE OF THE CHINESE 
REVOLUTION 
In the first period of the Chinese revolution, at the 
time of the first march to the North‹when the national 
army was approaching the Yangtse and scoring victory 
after victory, but a powerful movement of the workers 
and peasants had not yet unfolded‹the national bourgeoisie 
(not the compradors54) sided with the revolution. 
It was the revolution of a united all-national front. 
This does not mean that there were no contradictions 
between the revolution and the national bourgeoisie. All 
it means is that the national bourgeoisie, in supporting 
the revolution, tried to utilise it for its own purposes 
and, by directing it chiefly along the lines of territorial 
conquest, to restrict its scope. The struggle between the 
Rights and the Lefts in the Kuomintang at that period 
was a reflection of these contradictions. Chiang Kaishek¹s 
attempt in March 1926 to expel the Communists 
from the Kuomintang was the first serious attempt of 
the national bourgeoisie to curb the revolution. As is 
known, already at that time the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) considered 
that ³the line must be to keep the Communist

QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 227 
Party within the Kuomintang,² and that it was necessary 
³to work for the resignation or expulsion of the Rights 
from the Kuomintang² (April 1926). 
This line was one directed towards further development 
of the revolution, close co-operation between the 
Lefts and the Communists within the Kuomintang and 
within the national government, strengthening the unity 
of the Kuomintang and, at the same time, exposing and 
isolating the Kuomintang Rights, compelling them to 
submit to Kuomintang discipline, utilising the Rights, 
their connections and their experience, if they submitted 
to Kuomintang discipline, or expelling them from the 
Kuomintang if they violated that discipline and betrayed 
the interests of the revolution. 
Subsequent events fully confirmed the correctness 
of this line. The powerful development of the peasant 
movement and the organisation of peasant associations 
and peasant committees in the countryside, the powerful 
wave of strikes in the towns and the formation of 
trade-union councils, the victorious advance of the 
national army on Shanghai, which was besieged by 
imperialist warships and troops‹all these and similar 
facts indicate that the line adopted was the only correct 
one. 
This circumstance alone can explain the fact that 
the attempt made by the Rights in February 1927 to split 
the Kuomintang and set up a new centre in Nanchang 
failed in face of the unanimous resistance of the revolutionary 
Kuomintang in Wuhan. 
But this attempt was a sign that a regrouping of 
class forces was taking place in the country, that the 
Rights and the national bourgeoisie would not desist,

J. V. S T A L I N 228 
that they would intensify their work against the revolution. 
The C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) was therefore right when it 
said in March 1927 that: 
a) ³at the present time, in connection with the regrouping 
of class forces and concentration of the imperialist 
armies, the Chinese revolution is passing through 
a critical period, and that it can achieve further victories 
only by resolutely adopting the course of developing 
the mass movement²; 
b) ³it is necessary to adopt the course of arming the 
workers and peasants and converting the peasant committees 
in the localities into actual organs of governmental 
authority equipped with armed self-defence²; 
c) ³the Communist Party should not cover up the 
treacherous and reactionary policy of the Kuomintang 
Rights, and should mobilise the masses around the Kuomintang 
and the Chinese Communist Party with a view 
to exposing the Rights² (March 3, 1927). 
It will therefore be easily understood that the subsequent 
powerful sweep of the revolution, on the one 
hand, and the imperialist onslaught in Shanghai, on 
the other hand, were bound to throw the Chinese national 
bourgeoisie into the camp of counter-revolution, 
just as the occupation of Shanghai by national troops 
and the strikes of the Shanghai workers were bound 
to unite the imperialists attempting to strangle the revolution. 
And that is what happened. The Nanking massacre 
served in this respect as a signal for a new demarcation 
of the contending forces in China. In bombarding 
Nanking and presenting an ultimatum, the imperialists

QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 229 
desired to make it known that they were seeking the 
support of the national bourgeoisie for a joint struggle 
against the Chinese revolution. 
Chiang Kai-shek, on the other hand, in firing upon 
workers¹ meetings and engineering a coup, was, as it 
were, replying to the call of the imperialists and saying 
that he was ready to make a deal with them together with 
the national bourgeoisie against the Chinese workers 
and peasants. 
III 
THE SECOND STAGE OF THE CHINESE 
REVOLUTION 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s coup marks the desertion of the 
national bourgeoisie from the revolution, the emergence 
of a centre of national counter-revolution, and the conclusion 
of a deal between the Kuomintang Rights and 
the imperialists against the Chinese revolution. 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s coup signifies that in South China 
there will now be two camps, two governments, two 
armies, two centres‹the revolutionary centre in Wuhan 
and the counter-revolutionary centre in Nanking. 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s coup signifies that the revolution 
has entered the second stage of its development, 
that a swing has begun away from the revolution of an 
all-national united front and towards a revolution of 
the vast masses of the workers and peasants, towards 
an agrarian revolution, which will strengthen and broaden 
the struggle against imperialism, against the gentry 
and the feudal landlords, and against the militarists and 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s counter-revolutionary group.

J. V. S T A L I N 230 
This means that the struggle between the two paths 
of the revolution, between those who favour its further 
development and those who favour its liquidation, will 
grow more acute from day to day and fill the entire 
present period of the revolution. 
It means that, by waging a resolute struggle against 
militarism and imperialism, the revolutionary Kuomintang 
in Wuhan will become in fact the organ of a revolutionary-
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and 
peasantry, while Chiang Kai-shek¹s counter-revolutionary 
group in Nanking, by severing itself from the 
workers and peasants and drawing closer to imperialism, 
will in the end share the fate of the militarists. 
But it follows from this that the policy of preserving 
the unity of the Kuomintang, the policy of isolating 
the Rights within the Kuomintang and utilising them for 
the purposes of the revolution, no longer accords with 
the new tasks of the revolution. It must be replaced 
by a policy of resolutely expelling the Rights from the 
Kuomintang, a policy of resolutely fighting the Rights 
until they are completely eliminated politically, a policy 
of concentrating all power in the country in the hands 
of a revolutionary Kuomintang, a Kuomintang without 
its Right elements, a Kuomintang that is a bloc between 
the Kuomintang Lefts and the Communists. 
It follows, further, that the policy of close co-operation 
between the Lefts and the Communists within the 
Kuomintang acquires particular value and significance 
at this stage, that this co-operation reflects the alliance 
between the workers and peasants that is taking shape 
outside the Kuomintang, and that without such co-operation 
the victory of the revolution will be impossible.

QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 231 
It follows, further, that the principal source of strength 
of the revolutionary Kuomintang lies in the further 
development of the revolutionary movement of the 
workers and peasants and the strengthening of their mass 
organisations‹revolutionary peasant committees, workers¹ 
trade unions and other mass revolutionary organisations‹
as the preparatory elements of the future Soviets, 
and that the principal pledge of the victory of the 
revolution is the growth of the revolutionary activity 
of the vast masses of the working people, and the principal 
antidote to counter-revolution is the arming of 
the workers and peasants. 
It follows, lastly, that while fighting in the same 
ranks as the revolutionary Kuomintangists, the Communist 
Party must more than ever before preserve its independence, 
as an essential condition for ensuring the 
hegemony of the proletariat in the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution. 
IV 
ERRORS OF THE OPPOSITION 
The basic error of the opposition (Radek and Co.) 
is that it does not understand the character of the revolution 
in China, the stage it is now passing through, 
and its present international setting. 
The opposition demands that the Chinese revolution 
should develop at approximately the same pace 
as the October Revolution did. The opposition is 
dissatisfied because the Shanghai workers did not give 
decisive battle to the imperialists and their underlings.

J. V. S T A L I N 232 
But it does not realise that the revolution in China 
cannot develop at a fast pace, one reason being that the 
international situation today is less favourable than it 
was in 1917 (the imperialists are not at war with one 
another). 
It does not realise that decisive battle must not be 
given in unfavourable conditions, when the reserves 
have not yet been brought up‹just as the Bolsheviks, 
for example, did not give decisive battle either in April 
or in July 1917. 
The opposition does not realise that not to avoid 
decisive battle in unfavourable conditions (when it can 
be avoided) means making things easier for the enemies 
of the revolution. 
The opposition demands the immediate formation of 
Soviets of workers¹, peasants¹ and soldiers¹ deputies in 
China. But what would forming Soviets now mean? 
In the first place, they cannot be formed at any 
desired moment‹they are formed only when the tide of 
revolution is running particularly high. 
In the second place, Soviets are not formed for the 
sake of talk‹they are formed primarily as organs of 
struggle against the existing power, as organs of struggle 
for power. That was the case in 1905. It was also the 
case in 1917. 
But what would forming Soviets mean at the present 
moment in the area of action, say, of the Wuhan government? 
It would mean issuing the slogan of a struggle 
against the existing power in that area. It would mean 
issuing a slogan for the formation of new organs of power, 
a slogan of struggle against the power of the revolutionary 
Kuomintang, which includes Communists working in

QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 233 
a bloc with the Kuomintang Lefts, for no other power 
exists now in that area except the power of the revolutionary 
Kuomintang. 
It would mean, further, confusing the task of creating 
and strengthening mass organisations of the workers 
and peasants‹in the shape of strike committees, peasant 
associations and committees, trade-union councils, factory 
committees, etc.‹on which the revolutionary Kuomintang 
already relies, with the task of establishing a 
Soviet system, as a new type of state power, in place of 
the power of the revolutionary Kuomintang. 
It would mean, lastly, a failure to understand what 
stage the revolution in China is now passing through. 
It would mean placing in the hands of the enemies of 
the Chinese people a new weapon against the revolution, 
enabling them to spread new legends to the effect that 
what is taking place in China is not a national revolution, 
but artificially transplanted ³Moscow Sovietisation.² 
Hence, in advancing the slogan of the formation of 
Soviets at the present moment, the opposition is playing 
into the hands of the enemies of the Chinese revolution. 
The opposition considers inexpedient the participation 
of the Communist Party in the Kuomintang. The 
opposition, consequently, considers expedient a withdrawal 
of the Communist Party from the Kuomintang. But 
what would withdrawal from the Kuomintang mean now, 
when the entire imperialist gang with all its underlings 
are demanding the expulsion of the Communists from 
the Kuomintang? It would mean deserting the battlefield 
and abandoning its allies in the Kuomintang, to 
the glee of the enemies of the revolution. It would mean

J. V. S T A L I N 234 
weakening the Communist Party, undermining the revolutionary 
Kuomintang, facilitating the work of the 
Shanghai Cavaignacs and surrendering the banner of the 
Kuomintang, the most popular of all the banners in 
China, to the Kuomintang Rights. 
That is precisely what the imperialists, the militarists 
and the Kuomintang Rights are now demanding. 
It follows, therefore, that by declaring for a withdrawal 
of the Communist Party from the Kuomintang 
at the present moment, the opposition is playing into the 
hands of the enemies of the Chinese revolution. 
The recent plenum of the Central Committee of our 
Party therefore acted quite rightly in categorically rejecting 
the platform of the opposition.55

CONCERNING QUESTIONS 
OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 
Reply to Comrade Marchulin 
Your letter to the Derevensky Kommunist56 on the 
question of Soviets in China has been forwarded to me 
by the editorial board for reply. Presuming that you 
will have no objection, I am sending you a brief answer 
to your letter. 
I think, Comrade Marchulin, that your letter is based 
upon a misunderstanding. And for the following reasons. 
1) Stalin¹s theses for propagandists oppose the immediate 
formation of Soviets of workers¹, peasants¹ and soldiers¹ 
deputies in present-day China. You, however, join 
issue with Stalin and refer to Lenin¹s theses and speech at 
the Second Congress of the Comintern,57 where he speaks 
only of peasants¹ Soviets, of toilers¹ Soviets, of Soviets 
of the working people, but does not say a single word 
about the formation of Soviets of workers¹ deputies. 
Why does Lenin say nothing about the formation of 
Soviets of workers¹ deputies either in his theses or in 
his speech? Because, both in his speech and in his theses, 
Lenin has in mind countries where ³there can be no question 
of a purely proletarian movement,² where ³there 
is practically no industrial proletariat² (see Vol. XXV,

CONCERNING QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 237 
p. 353). Lenin definitely says in his speech that he 
has in mind such countries as Central Asia, Persia, 
where ³there is practically no industrial proletariat² 
(ibid.). 
Can one include among such countries China, with 
its industrial centres, such as Shanghai, Hankow, Nanking, 
Changsha, etc., where there are already some three 
million workers organised in trade unions? Obviously 
not. 
It is clear that in the case of present-day China, 
where there is a certain minimum of industrial proletariat, 
one must envisage the formation not simply of peasants¹ 
Soviets, or toilers¹ Soviets, but Soviets of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ deputies. 
It would be another matter if we were considering 
Persia, Afghanistan, etc. But, as you know, Stalin¹s 
theses deal not with Persia, Afghanistan, etc., but with 
China. 
Consequently your objection to Stalin¹s theses and 
your reference to Lenin¹s speech and theses at the Second 
Congress of the Comintern are mistaken and pointless. 
2) You quote in your letter a passage from the ³Supplementary 
Theses² of the Second Congress of the Comintern 
on the national and colonial question, where it is said 
that in the East ³the proletarian parties must carry on 
intensive propaganda of communist ideas and at the first 
opportunity establish workers¹ and peasants¹ Soviets.² 
In so doing, you make it appear as if these ³Supplementary 
Theses² and the passage you quote from them are 
Lenin¹s. That is not so, Comrade Marchulin. You have 
simply made a mistake. The ³Supplementary Theses² 
are Roy¹s. It was indeed as Roy¹s theses that they were

J. V. S T A L I N 238 
submitted at the Second Congress and adopted as a 
³supplement² to Lenin¹s theses (see verbatim report 
of the Second Congress of the Comintern, pp. 122-26). 
Why were the ³Supplementary Theses² needed? In 
order to single out from the backward colonial countries 
which have no industrial proletariat such countries as 
China and India, of which it cannot be said that they 
have ³practically no industrial proletariat.² Read the 
³Supplementary Theses,² and you will realise that they 
refer chiefly to China and India (see verbatim report 
of the Second Congress of the Comintern, p. 122). 
How could it happen that Roy¹s special theses were 
needed to ³supplement² Lenin¹s theses? The fact is that 
Lenin¹s theses had been written and published long before 
the Second Congress opened, long before the representatives 
from the colonial countries had arrived, 
and prior to the discussion in the special commission 
of the Second Congress. And since the discussion in 
the congress commission revealed the necessity for 
singling out from the backward colonies of the East 
such countries as China and India, the necessity for 
the ³Supplementary Theses² arose. 
Consequently, Lenin¹s speech and theses must not 
be confused with Roy¹s ³Supplementary Theses,² nor 
must it be forgotten that, in the case of countries like 
China and India, one must envisage the formation of 
workers¹ and peasants¹ Soviets, and not simply of peasants¹ 
Soviets. 
3) Will it be necessary to form workers¹ and peasants¹ 
Soviets in China? Yes, it certainly will. That is 
plainly stated in Stalin¹s theses for propagandists, which 
say:

CONCERNING QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 239 
³The principal source of strength of the revolutionary Kuomintang 
lies in the further development of the revolutionary movement 
of the workers and peasants and the strengthening of their 
mass organisations‹revolutionary peasant committees, workers¹ 
trade unions and other mass revolutionary organisations‹as 
the preparatory elements of the future Soviets.² . . .* 
The whole question is when to form them, in what 
circumstances, in what situation. 
Soviets of workers¹ deputies are an all-embracing, 
and therefore the best, revolutionary organisation of 
the working class. But that does not necessarily mean 
that they can be formed at any time and in any circumstances. 
When Khrustalyov, the first chairman of the 
St. Petersburg Soviet of Workers¹ Deputies, suggested 
the formation of Soviets of workers¹ deputies in the 
summer of 1906, after the tide of revolution had receded, 
Lenin objected and said that at that moment, when the 
rearguard (the peasantry) had not yet caught up with 
the vanguard (the proletariat), the formation of Soviets 
of workers¹ deputies was inexpedient. And Lenin was 
quite right. Why? Because Soviets of workers¹ deputies 
are not a simple workers¹ organisation. Soviets of workers¹ 
deputies are organs of the struggle of the working class 
against the existing power, organs of an uprising, organs 
of a new revolutionary power, and only as such can they 
develop and gain strength. And if the conditions do not 
exist for a direct mass struggle against the existing 
power, for a mass uprising against that power, for 
the organisation of a new revolutionary power, then the formation 
of workers¹ Soviets is inexpedient, since, in the 
* See this volume, p. 231.‹Ed.

J. V. S T A L I N 240 
absence of these conditions, they run the risk of decaying 
and becoming mere talkshops. 
Here is what Lenin said about Soviets of workers¹ 
deputies: 
³Soviets of workers¹ deputies are organs of direct struggle 
of the masses.² . . . ³It was not some kind of theory, not appeals 
on somebody¹s part, not tactics of somebody¹s invention, not a 
party doctrine, but the logic of facts that faced these non-Party, 
mass organs with the necessity of an uprising, and made them 
organs of an uprising. And to establish such organs at the present 
time would mean creating organs of an uprising,* and to call 
for their establishment would mean calling for an uprising.* To 
forget this, or to veil it from the eyes of the broad mass of the 
people would be the most unpardonable short-sightedness and the 
worst of policies² (see Vol. X, p. 15). 
Or again: 
³The whole experience of both revolutions, that of 1905 
and that of 1917, and all the decisions of the Bolshevik Party, 
all its political statements for many years past, boil down to this 
‹that a Soviet of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies is practicable 
only as the organ of an uprising,* only as an organ of revolutionary 
power.* If this is not their purpose, Soviets become empty 
playthings that are bound to lead to apathy, indifference and disillusionment 
among the masses, who quite naturally become fed up 
with the endless repetition of resolutions and protests² (see 
Vol. XXI, p. 288). 
That being the case, what would it mean to call for 
the immediate formation of Soviets of workers¹, peasants¹ 
and soldiers¹ deputies in present-day South China, in 
the area, say, of the Wuhan government, where the revolutionary 
Kuomintang is now in power, and the movement 
* My italics.‹J. St.

CONCERNING QUESTIONS OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION 241 
is developing under the slogan ³All power to the revolutionary 
Kuomintang²? To call now for the formation 
of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in this 
area would mean calling for an uprising against the power 
of the revolutionary Kuomintang. Would that be expedient? 
Obviously not. Obviously, whoever at the present 
time calls for the immediate formation of Soviets 
of workers¹ deputies in this area is trying to skip over 
the Kuomintang phase of the Chinese revolution, is 
running the risk of putting the revolution in China in 
a most difficult position. 
That, Comrade Marchulin, is how matters stand 
with the question of the immediate formation of Soviets 
of workers¹, peasants¹ and soldiers¹ deputies in China. 
At the Second Congress of the Comintern a special resolution 
was adopted entitled: ³When and in What Circumstances 
Soviets of Workers¹ Deputies May Be Formed.² 
Lenin was present when that resolution was adopted. I 
would advise you to read it. It is not without interest 
(see verbatim report of the Second Congress of the Comintern, 
pp. 580-83). 
4) When will it be necessary to form Soviets of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ deputies in China? Soviets of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ deputies will necessarily have to be formed 
in China at the moment when the victorious agrarian 
revolution has developed to the full, when the Kuomintang, 
as a bloc of the revolutionary Narodniks of China 
(the Kuomintang Left) and the Communist Party, begins 
to outlive its day, when the bourgeois-democratic revolution, 
which has not yet triumphed and will not triumph 
so soon, begins to manifest its negative features, when 
it becomes necessary to pass step by step from the

J. V. S T A L I N 242 
present, Kuomintang type of state organisation to a 
new, proletarian type of organisation of the state. 
It is in this way that the passage on workers¹ 
and peasants¹ Soviets in Roy¹s ³Supplementary Theses² 
adopted at the Second Congress of the Comintern should 
be understood. 
Has that moment already arrived? 
There is no need to prove that it has not yet arrived. 
What, then, is to be done at this moment? The agrarian 
revolution in China must be broadened and deepened. 
Mass workers¹ and peasants¹ organisations of every 
kind must be created and strengthened‹from trade-union 
councils and strike committees to peasant associations 
and peasant revolutionary committees‹with a view to 
converting them, as the revolutionary movement grows 
and achieves success, into organisational and political 
bases for the future Soviets of workers¹, peasants¹ and 
soldiers¹ deputies. 
That is the task now.

TALK WITH STUDENTS 
OF THE SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 
May 13, 1927 
Comrades, unfortunately, I can devote only two or 
three hours to today¹s talk. Next time, perhaps, we 
shall arrange a longer conversation. Today, I think, 
we might confine ourselves to an examination of the 
questions which you have formulated in writing. I have 
received ten questions in all. I shall reply to them in 
today¹s talk. If there are additional questions‹and I 
am told there are‹I shall try to answer them in our 
next talk. Well then, let us get down to business. 
FIRST QUESTION 
³Why is Radek wrong in asserting that the struggle 
of the peasantry in the Chinese countryside is directed 
not so much against feudal survivals as against the bourgeoisie? 
³Can it be affirmed that merchant capitalism predominates 
in China, or feudal survivals? 
³Why are the Chinese militarists, who are owners of 
big industrial enterprises, at the same time representatives 
of feudalism?² 
Radek does, indeed, assert something similar to 
what is stated in this question. As far as I recall, in his

J. V. S T A L I N 244 
speech to the activists of the Moscow organisation, he either 
completely denied the existence of feudal survivals in the 
Chinese countryside, or attached no great importance to 
them. 
That, of course, is a grave error on Radek¹s 
part. 
If there were no feudal survivals in China, or if 
they were not of very great importance for the Chinese 
countryside, there would be no soil for an agrarian revolution, 
and there would then be no point in speaking of 
the agrarian revolution as one of the chief tasks of the 
Communist Party at the present stage of the Chinese 
revolution. 
Does merchant capital exist in the Chinese countryside? 
Yes, it does. And it not only exists, but is sucking 
the blood of the peasantry no less effectively than any 
feudal lord. But this merchant capital of the type of 
primitive accumulation is peculiarly combined in the 
Chinese countryside with the domination of the feudal 
lord, of the landlord, and adopts the latter¹s medieval 
methods of exploiting and oppressing the peasants. That 
is the point, comrades. 
Radek¹s mistake is that he has not grasped this 
peculiarity, this combination of the domination of feudal 
survivals with the existence of merchant capital in 
the Chinese countryside, along with the preservation 
of medieval feudal methods of exploiting and oppressing 
the peasantry. 
Militarism, tuchuns, all kinds of governors and the 
entire present flint-hearted and rapacious bureaucracy, 
military and non-military, constitute a superstructure 
on this peculiar feature in China.

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 245 
Imperialism supports and strengthens the whole of 
this feudal-bureaucratic machine. 
The fact that some of the militarists who own landed estates 
are at the same time owners of industrial enterprises 
does not alter anything at bottom. Many of the Russian 
landlords, too, in their time owned factories and other 
industrial enterprises, which, however, did not prevent 
them from being representatives of feudal survivals. 
If in a number of regions 70 per cent of the peasants¹ 
earnings go to the gentry, the landlords, if the landlord 
actually wields power both in the economic sphere and 
in the administrative and judicial sphere, if the purchase 
and sale of women and children is still practised in a 
number of provinces‹then it must be admitted that 
the predominating power in this medieval situation 
is the power of feudal survivals, the power of the landlords 
and of the land-owning bureaucracy, military and 
non-military, in a peculiar combination with the power 
of merchant capital. 
It is these peculiar conditions that create the soil 
for the peasant agrarian movement which is growing, 
and will continue to grow, in China. 
In the absence of these conditions, in the absence 
of feudal survivals and feudal oppression, there would 
be no question in China of an agrarian revolution, of 
the confiscation of the landlords¹ land, and so forth. 
In the absence of these conditions, an agrarian revolution 
in China would be incomprehensible.

J. V. S T A L I N 246 
SECOND QUESTION 
³Why is Radek wrong in asserting that, since Marxists 
do not admit the possibility of a party of several classes, 
the Kuomintang is a petty-bourgeois party?² 
This question calls for a few observations. 
Firstly. The question is put incorrectly. We do not 
say, and never have said, that the Kuomintang is a 
party of several classes. That is not true. We have always 
said that the Kuomintang is the party of a bloc of several 
oppressed classes. That is not one and the same thing, 
comrades. If the Kuomintang were a party of several 
classes, that would mean that not one of the classes 
linked with the Kuomintang would have its own party 
outside the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang itself 
would constitute one single and common party for all 
these classes. But is that the state of affairs in reality? 
Has not the Chinese proletariat, which is linked with 
the Kuomintang, also its own separate party, the Communist 
Party, which is distinct from the Kuomintang 
and which has its own special programme and its own 
special organisation? It is clear that the Kuomintang is 
not a party of several oppressed classes, but is the party 
of a bloc of several oppressed classes that have their 
own party organisations. Consequently, the question is 
put incorrectly. In point of fact, in present-day China 
the Kuomintang can be regarded only as the party of a 
bloc of oppressed classes. 
Secondly. It is not true that Marxism does not in 
principle admit the possibility of a party of a bloc of 
oppressed, revolutionary classes, and that it is impermissible 
in principle for Marxists to belong to such a

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 247 
party. That, comrades, is absolutely untrue. In point 
of fact Marxism has not only recognised (and continues 
to recognise) the permissibility in principle of Marxists 
joining such a party, but in definite historical conditions 
has put this principle into practice. I might refer 
to the example of Marx himself in 1848, at the time of 
the German revolution, when he and his supporters 
joined the bourgeois-democratic league in Germany58 and 
collaborated in it with representatives of the revolutionary 
bourgeoisie. It is known that, in addition to 
Marxists, this bourgeois-democratic league, this bourgeoisrevolutionary 
party, included representatives of therevolutionary 
bourgeoisie. The Neue Rheinische Zeitung,59 
of which Marx was then the editor, was the organ of that 
bourgeois-democratic league. Only in the spring of 1849, 
when the tide of revolution in Germany had begun to 
recede, did Marx and his supporters resign from that 
bourgeois-democratic league, having decided to set up 
an absolutely independent organisation of the working 
class, with an independent class policy. 
As you see, Marx went even further than the Chinese 
Communists of our day, who form part of the Kuomintang 
precisely as an independent proletarian party with its 
own special organisation. 
One may dispute or not whether it was expedient 
for Marx and his supporters to join the bourgeois-democratic 
league in Germany in 1848, when it was a matter of 
waging, in conjunction with the revolutionary bourgeoisie, 
a revolutionary struggle against absolutism. That 
is a question of tactics. But that Marx recognised the permissibility 
in principle of such joining is something 
of which there can be no doubt whatever.

J. V. S T A L I N 248 
Thirdly. It would be fundamentally incorrect to say 
that the Kuomintang in Wuhan is a petty-bourgeois party, 
and to leave it at that. The Kuomintang can be characterised 
in that way only by people who have no understanding 
either of imperialism in China, or of the character 
of the Chinese revolution. The Kuomintang is not an 
³ordinary² petty-bourgeois party. There are different 
kinds of petty-bourgeois parties. The Mensheviks and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries in Russia were also pettybourgeois 
parties; but at the same time they were imperialist 
parties, because they were in a militant alliance 
with the French and British imperialists, and together 
with them engaged in the conquest and oppression of 
other countries‹Turkey, Persia, Mesopotamia, Galicia. 
Can it be said that the Kuomintang is an imperialist 
party? Obviously not. The Kuomintang party is 
anti-imperialist, just as the revolution in China is antiimperialist. 
The difference is fundamental. To fail to 
see this difference and to confuse the anti-imperialist 
Kuomintang with the imperialist Socialist-Revolutionary 
and Menshevik parties means to have no understanding 
of the national revolutionary movement in China. 
Of course, if the Kuomintang were an imperialist 
petty-bourgeois party, the Chinese Communists would not 
have formed a bloc with it, but would have sent it to all 
the archangels. The fact of the matter, however, is that 
the Kuomintang is an anti-imperialist party which is waging 
a revolutionary struggle against the imperialists 
and their agents in China. In this respect, the Kuomintang 
stands head and shoulders above all the various imperialist 
³Socialists² of the Kerensky and Tsereteli type. 
Even Chiang Kai-shek, who is a Right Kuomintang

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 249 
ist, Chiang Kai-shek, who before he carried out his coup 
engaged in all sorts of machinations against the Left 
Kuomintangists and the Communists‹even he was then 
superior to the Kerenskys and Tseretelis; for, whereas the 
Kerenskys and Tseretelis were warring for the enslavement 
of Turkey, Persia, Mesopotamia, Galicia, thus helping 
to strengthen imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek was 
warring‹whether well or badly‹against the enslavement 
of China, and was thus helping to weaken imperialism.
Radek¹s error, and that of the opposition generally, 
is that he disregards the semi-colonial status of China, 
fails to observe the anti-imperialist character of the 
Chinese revolution, and does not observe that the Kuomintang 
in Wuhan, the Kuomintang without the Right 
Kuomintangists, is the centre of the struggle of the 
Chinese labouring masses against imperialism. 
THIRD QUESTION 
³Is there not a contradiction between your appraisal 
of the Kuomintang (speech at the meeting of students of 
the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, 
May 18, 1925) as a bloc of two forces‹the Communist Party 
and the petty bourgeoisie‹and the appraisal given in 
the Comintern¹s resolution on the Kuomintang as a bloc 
of four classes, including the big bourgeoisie? 
³Would it be possible for the Chinese Communist 
Party to belong to the Kuomintang if there were a dictatorship 
of the proletariat in China?² 
In the first place, it should be noted that the definition 
of the actual situation in the Kuomintang given

J. V. S T A L I N 250 
by the Comintern in December 1926 (Seventh Enlarged 
Plenum) is reproduced in your ³question² incorrectly, 
not quite accurately. The ³question² says: ³including 
the big bourgeoisie.² But the compradors are also a 
big bourgeoisie. Does this mean that in December 1926 
the Comintern considered the comprador bourgeoisie a 
member of the bloc within the Kuomintang? It obviously 
does not, because the comprador bourgeoisie was, and 
remains, a sworn enemy of the Kuomintang. The Comintern 
resolution speaks not of the big bourgeoisie in general, 
but of ³part of the capitalist bourgeoisie.² Consequently, 
what is referred to here is not every kind of big 
bourgeoisie, but the national bourgeoisie of the noncomprador 
type. 
In the second place, I must say that I do not see 
any contradiction between these two definitions of the 
Kuomintang. I do not see any, because what we have 
here is a definition of the Kuomintang from two different 
standpoints, neither of which can be termed incorrect, 
for they are both correct. 
When, in 1925, I spoke of the Kuomintang as the 
party of a bloc of the workers and peasants, I by no 
means intended to describe the actual state of affairs 
in the Kuomintang, to describe what classes were in 
fact linked with the Kuomintang in 1925. When I spoke 
of the Kuomintang then, I was thinking of it only as the 
type of structure of a distinctive people¹s revolutionary 
party in the oppressed countries of the East, especially 
in such countries as China and India; as the type of 
structure of such a people¹s revolutionary party as must 
be based on a revolutionary bloc of the workers and 
the petty bourgeoisie of town and country. I plainly

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 251 
stated at that time that ³in such countries the Communists 
must pass from the policy of a united national 
front to the policy of a revolutionary bloc of the workers 
and the petty bourgeoisie² (see Stalin, ³The Political 
Tasks of the University of the Peoples of the East,² 
Problems of Leninism, p. 26460). 
What I had in mind, therefore, was not the present, 
but the future of people¹s revolutionary parties in general, 
and of the Kuomintang in particular. And I was 
absolutely right in this. For organisations like the 
Kuomintang can have a future only if they strive to 
base themselves upon a bloc of the workers and the 
petty bourgeoisie, and in speaking of the petty bourgeoisie 
one should have in mind principally the 
peasantry, which constitutes the basic force of the petty 
bourgeoisie in the capitalistically backward countries. 
The Comintern, however, was interested in a different 
aspect of the matter. At its Seventh Enlarged Plenum 
it regarded the Kuomintang not from the standpoint 
of its future, of what it should become, but from the standpoint 
of the present, of the actual situation within the 
Kuomintang, and of just what classes were in fact linked 
with it in 1926. And the Comintern was absolutely right 
when it said that at that moment, when there was not yet 
a split in the Kuomintang, the latter did in fact comprise 
a bloc of the workers, the petty bourgeoisie (urban and 
rural) and the national bourgeoisie. One might add here 
that not only in 1926, but in 1925 as well the Kuomintang 
was based upon a bloc of precisely those classes. 
The Comintern resolution, in the drafting of which I took 
a very active part, plainly states that ³the proletariat

J. V. S T A L I N 252 
forms a bloc with the peasantry, which is actively 
entering the struggle on its own behalf, with the urban 
petty bourgeoisie, and with part of the capitalist bourgeoisie,² 
and that ³this combination of forces has found 
its political expression in a corresponding grouping 
within the Kuomintang party and the Canton government² 
(see the resolution61). 
But inasmuch as the Comintern did not confine itself 
to the actual state of affairs in 1926, but also touched 
upon the future of the Kuomintang, it could not but 
state that this bloc was only a temporary one, that 
it was bound in the near future to be superseded by a 
bloc of the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie. It 
is precisely for this reason that the Comintern resolution 
goes on to say that ³at the present time the movement 
is on the threshold of a third stage, on the eve of 
a new regrouping of classes,² and that ³at that stage 
of development the basic force of the movement will be 
a bloc of a still more revolutionary character‹a bloc 
of the proletariat, the peasantry and the urban petty 
bourgeoisie, with the ousting* of the greater part of the 
big capitalist bourgeoisie² (ibid.). 
That is precisely the bloc of the workers and the 
petty bourgeoisie (peasantry) upon which the Kuomintang 
should have relied for support, which is already beginning 
to take shape in Wuhan after the splitting of the 
Kuomintang and the desertion of the national bourgeoisie, 
and about which I spoke in my address to the Communist 
University of the Toilers of the East in 1925 
(see above). 
*My italics.‹J. St.

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 253 
Thus we have a description of the Kuomintang from 
two different aspects: 
a) from the aspect of its present, of the actual state 
of affairs in the Kuomintang in 1926, and 
b) from the aspect of its future, of what the Kuomintang 
should be, as the type of structure of a people¹s revolutionary 
party in the countries of the East. 
Both these descriptions are legitimate and correct, 
because, embracing the Kuomintang from two different 
aspects, in the final analysis they give an exhaustive 
picture. 
Where then, one asks, is the contradiction? 
Let us, for the sake of greater clarity, take the ³Workers¹ 
Party² in Britain (the ³Labour Party²). We know 
that there is in Britain a special party of the workers 
that is based on the trade unions of the factory and 
office workers. No one hesitates to call it a workers¹ 
party. It is called that not only in British, but in all 
other Marxist literature. 
But can it be said that this party is a real workers¹ 
party, a class party of the workers, standing in 
opposition to the bourgeoisie? Can it be said that it is 
actually the party of one class, the working class, and 
not a party, say, of two classes? No, it cannot. Actually, 
the Labour Party in Britain is the party of a bloc of the 
workers and the urban petty bourgeoisie. Actually, it is 
the party of a bloc of two classes. And if it is asked whose 
influence is stronger in this party, that of the workers, 
who stand in opposition to the bourgeoisie, or that of 
the petty bourgeoisie, it must be said that the influence 
of the petty bourgeoisie predominates in this party. 
That indeed explains why the British Labour Party

J. V. S T A L I N 254 
is actually an appendage of the bourgeois liberal party. 
Yet it is called in Marxist literature a workers¹ party. 
How is this ³contradiction² to be explained? The explanation 
is that when this party is defined as a workers¹ 
party, what is usually meant is not the actual state of affairs 
within the party at present, but the type of structure 
of a workers¹ party by virtue of which it should in the 
future, given certain conditions, become a real class 
party of the workers, standing in opposition to the bourgeois 
world. That does not preclude, but on the contrary, 
presumes the fact that actually this party is, for the 
time being, the party of a bloc of the workers and the 
urban petty bourgeoisie. 
There is no more contradiction in this than there 
is in all I have just said about the Kuomintang. 
Would it be possible for the Chinese Communist 
Party to belong to the Kuomintang if there were a dictatorship 
of the proletariat in China? 
I think i t would be inexpedient and, therefore, 
impossible. It would be inexpedient not only if there 
were a dictatorship of the proletariat, but also if Soviets 
of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies were formed. For 
what does the formation of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ 
deputies in China mean? It means the creation of a dual 
power. I t means a struggle for power between the 
Kuomintang and the Soviets. The formation of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ Soviets is a preparation for the transition 
from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to the proletarian 
revolution, to the socialist revolution. Can such 
preparation be carried out under the leadership of two 
parties belonging to one common revolutionary democratic 
party? No, it cannot. The history of revolution

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 255 
tells us that preparation for the dictatorship of the 
proletariat and transition to the socialist revolution can 
be effected only under the leadership of one party, the 
Communist Party, if, of course, it is a genuine proletarian 
revolution that is in question. The history of revolution 
tells us that the dictatorship of the proletariat 
can be achieved and developed only under the leadership 
of one party, the Communist Party. Failing that, there 
can be no genuine and complete dictatorship of the proletariat 
under the conditions of imperialism. 
Consequently, not only when there is a dictatorship 
of the proletariat, but even prior to such a dictatorship, 
when Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies 
are being formed, the Communist Party will have to withdraw 
from the Kuomintang, in order to conduct the preparations 
for a Chinese October under its own exclusive 
leadership. 
I consider that in the period of the formation of 
Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in China, 
and of preparation for the Chinese October, the Chinese 
Communist Party will have to replace the present bloc 
within the Kuomintang by a bloc outside the Kuomintang, 
on the pattern, say, of the bloc which we had with the 
Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in the period of transition 
to October. 
FOURTH QUESTION 
³Is the Wuhan government a democratic dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry, and if not, what 
further ways of struggle are there for the establishment 
of a democratic dictatorship?

J. V. S T A L I N 256 
³Is Martynov right in asserting that the transition 
to the dictatorship of the proletariat is possible without 
a Œsecond¹ revolution, and if so, where is the border-line 
between democratic dictatorship and proletarian dictatorship 
in China?² 
The Wuhan government is not yet a democratic dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry. It may 
become one. It certainly will become a democratic dictatorship 
if the agrarian revolution develops to the full; 
but it is not yet the organ of such a dictatorship. 
What is required for the Wuhan government to be 
converted into the organ of a democratic dictatorship of 
the proletariat and peasantry? Two things, at least, 
are required for that: 
Firstly, the Wuhan government must become the 
government of an agrarian-peasant revolution in China, 
a government that gives the utmost support to that revolution. 
Secondly, the Kuomintang must replenish its top 
leadership with new leaders of the agrarian movement 
from the ranks of the peasants and workers and 
enlarge its lower organisations by including in them the 
peasant associations the workers¹ trade-union councils 
and other revolutionary organisations of town and 
country. 
At present, the Kuomintang has some 500,000 members. 
That is a small, a terribly small, number for China. 
The Kuomintang must include millions of revolutionary 
peasants and workers, and thus become a revolutionarydemocratic 
organisation many millions strong. 
Only under those conditions will the Kuomintang be 
in a position to set up a revolutionary government which

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 257 
will become the organ of a revolutionary-democratic 
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. 
Whether Comrade Martynov did actually speak of a 
peaceful transition to the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
I do not know. I have not read Comrade Martynov¹s 
article; I have not read it because it is not possible 
for me to keep an eye on all our day-to-day literature. 
But i f he really did say that a peaceful transition 
from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to the proletarian 
revolution was possible in China‹it is a 
mistake. 
Chugunov once asked me: ³What do you think, Comrade 
Stalin, wouldn¹t it be possible to arrange things so 
as, through the Kuomintang, without going roundabout, 
to pass at once to the dictatorship of the proletariat 
by peaceful means?² I, in my turn, asked him: 
³And what is it like, Comrade Chugunov, in China? Have 
you Right Kuomintangists, a capitalist bourgeoisie, imperialists?² 
He replied in the affirmative. ³Well then,² 
I said, ³a fight is unavoidable.² 
That was before Chiang Kai-shek¹s coup. Theoretically, 
of course, the possibility of a peaceful development 
of the revolution in China is conceivable. Lenin, 
for example, at one time thought that a peaceful development 
of the revolution in Russia was possible through 
the Soviets. That was in the period from April to July 
1917. But after the July defeat Lenin recognised that 
a peaceful transition to the proletarian revolution 
had to be considered out of the question. I think that 
still more must a peaceful transition to the proletarian 
revolution be considered out of the question in 
China.

J. V. S T A L I N 258 
Why? 
Firstly, because the enemies of the Chinese revolution‹
both internal (Chang Tso-lin, Chiang Kai-shek, 
the big bourgeoisie, the gentry, the landlords, etc.) 
and external (the imperialists)‹are too numerous and 
too strong to allow of thinking that the further development 
of the revolution can proceed without big class 
battles and without serious splits and desertions. 
Secondly, because there is no reason to regard the 
Kuomintang form of state organisation as an expedient 
form for the transition from the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution to the proletarian revolution. 
Lastly, because if, for example, in Russia a peaceful 
transition to the proletarian revolution did not succeed 
through the Soviets, which are the classic form 
of the proletarian revolution, what grounds are there 
for assuming that such a transition can succeed through 
the Kuomintang? 
I therefore think that a peaceful transition to the 
proletarian revolution must be considered out of the 
question in China. 
FIFTH QUESTION 
³Why is the Wuhan government not conducting an 
offensive against Chiang Kai-shek, but is attacking Chang 
Tso-lin? 
³Does not the simultaneous offensive of the Wuhan 
government and Chiang Kai-shek against the North blur 
the front of the struggle against the Chinese bourgeoisie?² 
Well, comrades, you are asking too much of the Wuhan 
government. It would be very fine, of course, to beat

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 259 
simultaneously Chang Tso-lin and Chiang Kai-shek and 
Li Chi-shen and Yang Sen. But the position of the Wuhan 
government just now is such as not to permit it to launch 
an offensive simultaneously on all four fronts. The 
Wuhan government undertook the offensive against the 
Mukdenites for at least two reasons. 
Firstly, because the Mukdenites are pushing towards 
Wuhan and want to annihilate it, so that the offensive 
against the Mukdenites is an absolutely urgent measure 
of defence. 
Secondly, because the Wuhaners want to join forces 
with Feng Yu-hsiang¹s troops and to advance further 
in order to broaden the base of the revolution, which, 
again, is a matter of the greatest military and political 
importance for Wuhan at the present moment. 
A simultaneous offensive on two such important 
fronts as against Chiang Kai-shek and Chang Tso-lin is 
at the present time beyond the strength of the Wuhan 
government. That is apart from an offensive westwards, 
against Yang Sen, and southwards, against Li 
Chi-shen. 
We, the Bolsheviks, were stronger at the time of 
the Civil War, yet we were unable to develop successful 
offensive operations on all the fronts. What grounds 
are there for expecting more from the Wuhan government 
at the present moment? 
Furthermore, what would an offensive against 
Shanghai mean just now, when the Mukdenites and Wu 
Pei-fu¹s supporters are moving on Wuhan from the north? 
It would mean making things easier for the Mukdenites 
and putting off union with Feng¹s troops for an indefinite 
period, without gaining anything in the east. For the

J. V. S T A L I N 260 
time being, let Chiang Kai-shek rather continue to flounder 
in the Shanghai area and hobnob there with the 
imperialists. 
There will be battles yet for Shanghai, and not of 
the kind that are now being waged for Chengchow, etc. 
No, the battles there will be far more serious. Imperialism 
will not so lightly relinquish Shanghai, which 
is a world centre where the cardinal interests of the 
imperialist groups intersect. 
Would it not be more expedient first to join forces 
with Feng, acquire sufficient military strength, develop 
the agrarian revolution to the full, and carry on intense 
work to demoralise Chiang Kai-shek¹s rear and front, 
and then, after that, to tackle the problem of Shanghai 
in all its magnitude? I think that would be more expedient. 
Consequently, it is not at all a matter here of ³blurring² 
the front of the struggle against the Chinese bourgeoisie, 
because in any case it cannot be blurred if the 
agrarian revolution develops‹and that the latter is 
developing and will continue to develop is now scarcely 
open to doubt. I repeat, it is not a matter of ³blurring,² 
but of developing appropriate fighting tactics. 
Some comrades think that an offensive on all fronts 
is now the principal sign of revolutionary spirit. No, 
comrades, that is not true. An offensive on all fronts 
at this moment would be stupidity, not a sign of revolutionary 
spirit. Stupidity should not be confused with 
revolutionary spirit.

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 261 
SIXTH QUESTION 
³Is a Kemalist revolution possible in China?² 
I consider it improbable in China, and therefore 
impossible. 
A Kemalist revolution is possible only in countries 
like Turkey, Persia or Afghanistan, where there is no 
industrial proletariat, or practically none, and where 
there is no powerful agrarian-peasant revolution. 
A Kemalist revolution is a revolution of the top stratum, 
a revolution of the national merchant bourgeoisie, arising 
in a struggle against the foreign imperialists, and 
whose subsequent development is essentially directed 
against the peasants and workers, against the very possibility 
of an agrarian revolution. 
A Kemalist revolution is impossible in China because: 
a) there is in China a certain minimum of militant 
and active industrial proletariat, which enjoys enormous 
prestige among the peasants; 
b) there is in that country a developed agrarian 
revolution which in its advance is sweeping away the 
survivals of feudalism. 
The vast mass of the peasantry, which in a number 
of provinces has already been seizing the land, and 
which is led in its struggle by the revolutionary 
proletariat of China‹that is the antidote against the 
possibility of what is called a Kemalist revolution. 
The Kemalist Party cannot be put on a par with the 
Left Kuomintang party in Wuhan, just as Turkey cannot 
be put on a par with China. Turkey has no such centres 
as Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanking, Tientsin, etc. Ankara

J. V. S T A L I N 262 
falls far short of Wuhan, just as the Kemalist Party falls 
far short of the Left Kuomintang. 
One should also bear in mind the difference between 
China and Turkey as regards their international position. 
In relation to Turkey, imperialism has already secured 
a number of its principal demands, having wrested from 
it Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia and other points of 
importance to the imperialists. Turkey has now been 
reduced to the dimensions of a small country with a population 
of some ten to twelve million. It does not represent 
for imperialism a market of any importance or a 
decisive field of investment. One of the reasons why this 
has happened is that the old Turkey was an agglomeration 
of nationalities, with a compact Turkish population only 
in Anatolia. 
Not so with China. China is a nationally compact 
country with a population of several hundred million, 
and constitutes one of the most important markets and 
fields for capital export in the world. Whereas in 
Turkey imperialism could content itself with severing 
from i t a number of very important regions in the 
East, exploiting the national antagonisms between the 
Turks and the Arabs within the old Turkey, in China 
imperialism has to strike at the living body of national 
China, cutting it to pieces and severing whole provinces 
from it, in order to preserve its old positions, 
or at least to retain some of them. 
Consequently, whereas in Turkey the struggle against 
imperialism could end with a curtailed anti-imperialist 
revolution on the part of the Kemalists, in China the 
struggle against imperialism is bound to assume a profoundly 
popular and distinctly national character and

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 263 
is bound to deepen step by step, developing into desperate 
clashes with imperialism and shaking the very foundations 
of imperialism throughout the world. 
One of the gravest errors of the opposition (Zinoviev, 
Radek, Trotsky) is that it fails to perceive this 
profound difference between Turkey and China, confuses 
the Kemalist revolution with an agrarian revolution, 
and lumps everything indiscriminately into one heap. 
I know that among the Chinese nationalists there 
are people who cherish Kemalist ideas. There are pretenders 
in plenty to the role of a Kemal in China today. 
The chief among them is Chiang Kai-shek. I know that 
some Japanese journalists are inclined to regard Chiang 
Kai-shek as a Chinese Kemal. But that is all a dream, 
the illusion of frightened bourgeois. In China victory 
must go either to Chinese Mussolinis like Chang Tso-lin 
and Chang Tsung-chang, only for them to be overthrown 
later by the sweep of the agrarian revolution, 
or to Wuhan. 
Chiang Kai-shek and his followers, who are trying 
to hold a middle position between these two camps, are 
inevitably bound to fall and share the fate of Chang Tsolin 
and Chang Tsung-chang. 
SEVENTH QUESTION 
³Should the slogan of immediate seizure of the land 
by the peasantry be issued in China at this moment, and 
how should the seizure of land in Hunan be assessed?² 
I think that it should. Actually, the slogan of the 
confiscation of the land is already being carried out in 
certain areas. In a number of areas, such as Hunan,

J. V. S T A L I N 264 
Hupeh, etc., the peasants are already seizing the land from 
below, and are setting up their own courts, their own 
penal organs and their own self-defence bodies. I believe 
that in the very near future the entire peasantry of China 
will go over to the slogan of the confiscation of the land. 
Therein lies the strength of the Chinese revolution. 
If Wuhan wants to win, if it wants to create a real 
force both against Chang Tso-lin and against Chiang 
Kai-shek, as well as against the imperialists, it must 
give the utmost support to the agrarian-peasant revolution 
for the seizure of the landlords¹ land. 
It would be foolish to think that feudalism and imperialism 
can be overthrown in China by armed strength 
alone. Without an agrarian revolution and without 
active support of the Wuhan troops by the vast masses 
of the peasants and workers, such forces cannot be 
overthrown. 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s coup is often appraised by the 
opposition as the decline of the Chinese revolution. That 
is a mistake. People who appraise Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
coup as the decline of the Chinese revolution are in fact 
siding with Chiang Kai-shek, are in fact in favour of 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s being received back into the Wuhan 
Kuomintang. They apparently think that if Chiang Kaishek 
had not split away, the cause of the revolution 
would be going better. That is foolish and unrevolutionary. 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s coup has in fact led to the Kuomintang 
being cleansed of dross and to the core of the 
Kuomintang moving to the Left. Of course, Chiang Kaishek¹s 
coup was bound to result in a partial defeat for 
the workers in a number of areas. But that is merely a 
partial and temporary defeat. In point of fact, with

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 265 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s coup, the revolution as a whole has 
entered a higher phase of development, the phase of an 
agrarian movement. 
Therein lies the strength and might of the Chinese 
revolution. 
The progress of a revolution must not be regarded 
as progress along an unbroken ascending line. That is a 
bookish, not a realistic notion of revolution. A revolution 
always moves in zigzags, advancing and smashing 
the old order in some areas, and sustaining partial 
defeats and retreating in others. Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
coup is one of those zigzags in the course of the Chinese 
revolution, one that was needed in order to cleanse the 
revolution of dross and to impel it forward towards a 
powerful agrarian movement. 
But for this agrarian movement to be able to take 
shape, it must have its general slogan. That slogan is 
the confiscation of the landlords¹ land. 
EIGHTH QUESTION 
³Why is it incorrect to issue the slogan of the formation 
of Soviets at the present moment? 
³Does not the Chinese Communist Party run the danger 
of lagging behind the movement in view of the formation 
of workers¹ Soviets in Honan?² 
What kind of Soviets does the question refer to‹ 
proletarian Soviets, or non-proletarian Soviets, ³peasants¹² 
Soviets, ³toilers¹² Soviets, ³people¹s² Soviets? 
In his theses at the Second Congress of the Comintern, 
Lenin spoke of the formation of ³peasants¹ Soviets,² 
³toilers¹ Soviets,² in the backward countries of the

J. V. S T A L I N 266 
East. He had in mind such countries as Central Asia, 
where ³there is no industrial proletariat, or practically 
none.² He had in mind countries such as Persia, Afghanistan, 
etc. That, indeed, explains why there is not a 
single word in Lenin¹s theses about the organisation of 
workers¹ Soviets in such countries. 
But it is evident from this that what Lenin¹s theses 
were concerned with was not China, of which it cannot 
be said that it has ³no industrial proletariat, or practically 
none,² but other, more backward, countries of 
the East. 
Consequently, what is in question is the immediate 
formation of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies 
in China. Consequently, in deciding this question 
it is not Lenin¹s theses that must be borne in 
mind, but Roy¹s, which were adopted by the same Second 
Congress of the Comintern, and which speak of the 
formation of workers¹ and peasants¹ Soviets in countries 
such as China and India. But it is said there that workers¹ 
and peasants¹ Soviets should be formed in those countries 
when passing from the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
to the proletarian revolution. 
What are Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies? 
Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies are, chiefly, 
organs of an uprising against the existing power, organs 
of struggle for a new revolutionary power, organs 
of the new revolutionary power. At the same time, 
Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies are centres of 
organisation of the revolution. 
But Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies can 
be centres of organisation of the revolution only if they 
are organs for the overthrow of the existing power,

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 267 
if they are organs of a new revolutionary power. 
If they are not organs of a new revolutionary power, 
they cannot be centres of organisation of the revolutionary 
movement. This the opposition refuses to understand, 
combating the Leninist conception of Soviets of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ deputies. 
What would the formation at the present time of 
Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in the area of 
action, say, of the Wuhan government mean? It would 
mean the creation of a dual power, the creation of organs 
of revolt against the Wuhan government. Should the 
Chinese Communists overthrow the Wuhan government at 
the present time? It is clear that they should not. On the 
contrary, they should support it and convert it into an 
organ of struggle against Chang Tso-lin, against Chiang 
Kai-shek, against the landlords and gentry, against 
imperialism. 
But if the Communist Party at the present time ought 
not to overthrow the Wuhan government, what would 
be the sense of forming Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ 
deputies now? 
One or the other: 
either Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies 
are formed immediately in order to overthrow the Wuhan 
government, which would be incorrect and inadmissible 
at the present moment; 
or in setting up Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ 
deputies immediately, the Communists do not work for 
the overthrow of the Wuhan government, the Soviets 
do not become organs of a new revolutionary power‹ 
and in that case the Soviets will wither and become a 
travesty of Soviets.

J. V. S T A L I N 268 
That is what Lenin always warned against when he 
spoke of the formation of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ 
deputies. 
Your ³question² says that workers¹ Soviets are being 
formed in Honan, and that the Communist Party risks 
lagging behind the movement if it does not go to the 
masses with the slogan of the formation of Soviets. That 
is nonsense, comrades. There are no Soviets of workers¹ 
deputies in Honan at this moment. That is a canard 
spread by the British press. What we have there are 
³Red Spears²62; peasant associations are there, but 
of Soviets of workers¹ deputies there is so far not 
even a hint. 
Workers¹ Soviets could, of course, be formed. That 
is not a very difficult matter. But the point is not the 
formation of workers¹ Soviets; the point is to convert 
them into organs of a new revolutionary power. Failing 
that, Soviets become an empty shell, a travesty of 
Soviets. To form workers¹ Soviets prematurely only in 
order to cause them to collapse and to turn them into an 
empty shell would indeed mean helping to convert the 
Chinese Communist Party from the leader of the bourgeois-
democratic revolution into an appendage of all 
kinds of ³ultra-Left² experiments with Soviets. 
Khrustalyov, the first chairman of the Soviet of 
Workers¹ Deputies in St. Petersburg in 1905, likewise 
urged the restoration, and therefore also the formation, 
of Soviets of workers¹ deputies in the summer of 1906, 
believing that Soviets by themselves were capable of 
reversing the relationship of class forces, irrespective 
of the situation. Lenin at the time opposed Khrustalyov 
and said that Soviets of workers¹ deputies ought not

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 269 
to be formed then, in the summer of 1906, since the rearguard 
(the peasantry) had not yet caught up with the 
vanguard (the proletariat), and to form Soviets under 
such circumstances, and thereby to issue the slogan of 
an uprising, would be risky and inexpedient. 
But it follows from this, firstly, that the role of 
Soviets in themselves should not be exaggerated, and, 
secondly, that when forming Soviets of workers¹ and 
peasants¹ deputies the surrounding circumstances must 
not be ignored. 
Is it necessary at all to form Soviets of workers¹ and 
peasants¹ deputies in China? 
Yes, it is necessary. They will have to be formed 
when the Wuhan revolutionary government has become 
consolidated and the agrarian revolution has developed, 
at the time of the transition from the agrarian revolution, 
from the bourgeois-democratic revolution, to the 
proletarian revolution. 
The formation of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ 
deputies will mean laying the foundations of Soviet 
power in China. But laying the foundations of Soviet 
power will mean laying the foundations of dual power 
and steering a course towards the replacement of the 
present Wuhan Kuomintang power by Soviet power. 
I think that the time for that has not yet come. 
Your ³question² speaks of the hegemony of the proletariat 
and the Communist Party in China. 
But what is required in order to facilitate the Chinese 
proletariat¹s role of leader, of hegemon, in the present 
bourgeois-democratic revolution? 
This requires, in the first place, that the Chinese 
Communist Party should be a solidly united organisation

J. V. S T A L I N 270 
of the working class, with its own programme, its own 
platform, its own organisation, its own line. 
This requires, secondly, that the Chinese Communists 
should be in the front ranks of the agrarian-peasant movement, 
that they should teach the peasants, especially 
the poor peasants, to organise in revolutionary associations 
and committees and work for the confiscation of the 
landlords¹ land. 
This requires, thirdly, that the Chinese Communists 
should strengthen their position in the army, revolutionise 
it, transform it and convert it from an instrument 
of individual adventurers into an instrument of revolution. 
This requires, lastly, that the Chinese Communists 
should participate in the local and central organs of 
the Wuhan government, in the local and central organs of 
the Wuhan Kuomintang, and there pursue a resolute 
policy for the further extension of the revolution both 
against the landlords and against imperialism. 
The opposition thinks that the Communist Party 
should preserve its independence by breaking with the 
revolutionary democratic forces and withdrawing from 
the Kuomintang and the Wuhan government. But that 
would be the sort of rather dubious ³independence² 
which the Mensheviks in our country spoke about in 
1905. We know that at that time the Mensheviks opposed 
Lenin and said: ³What we need is not the hegemony, 
but the independence of the workers¹ party.² Lenin 
rightly retorted that that was a negation of independence, 
for to counterpose independence to hegemony 
meant converting the proletariat into an appendage of 
the liberal bourgeoisie.

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


271 
I think that the opposition, in talking today of the 
independence of the Chinese Communist Party and at 
the same time urging or hinting that the Chinese Communist 
Party should withdraw from the Kuomintang and 
the Wuhan government, slips into the line of advocating 
the Menshevik ³independence² of the 1905 period. The 
Communist Party can preserve real independence and 
real hegemony only if it becomes the leading force both 
inside the Kuomintang and outside it, among the broad 
masses of the working people. 
Not withdrawal from the Kuomintang, but ensuring 
the leadership of the Communist Party both inside and 
outside the Kuomintang‹that is what is now required 
of the Chinese Communist Party, if it wants to be really 
independent. 
NINTH QUESTION 
³Is it possible at the present moment to raise the question 
of the formation of a regular Red Army in China?² 
I think that as a perspective this question should 
certainly be kept in mind. But, considered practically, 
it is impossible just now, at this moment, to replace 
the present army by a new army, a Red Army, simply 
because there is so far nothing to replace it by. 
The chief thing now is, while improving and revolutionising 
the existing army by all available means, to 
lay at once the foundations for new, revolutionary regiments 
and divisions, composed of revolutionary peasants 
who have passed through the school of the agrarian 
revolution and of revolutionary workers, to create 
a number of new and really reliable corps with reliable 
TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY

J. V. S T A L I N 272 
commanders, and to make them the bulwark of the 
revolutionary government in Wuhan. 
These corps will be the nucleus of the new army which 
will subsequently develop into a Red Army. 
That is necessary both for the fight on the battlefronts 
and especially for the fight in the rear against 
all kinds of counter revolutionary upstarts. 
Without this, there can be no guarantee against 
reverses in the rear and at the front, against desertions 
and betrayals. 
I think that this course is the only possible and 
expedient course for the time being. 
TENTH QUESTION 
³Is the slogan of seizing the Chinese enterprises possible 
now, at a time of struggle against the bourgeoisie? 
³Under what conditions will the seizure of the foreign 
factories in China be possible, and will it involve the 
simultaneous seizure of the Chinese enterprises?² 
I think that, generally speaking, the time is not 
yet ripe for passing to the seizure of the Chinese enterprises. 
But the possibility is not excluded that the stubborn 
sabotage of the Chinese employers, the closing 
down of a number of such enterprises and the artificial 
creation of unemployment may compel the Wuhan government 
to begin to nationalise some of these enterprises 
even at the present time and to set them going 
by its own efforts. 
It is possible that the Wuhan government may be 
compelled even at the present time to take such a 
step in individual cases, as a warning to particularly

TALK WITH STUDENTS OF SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY 273 
malevolent and counter-revolutionary Chinese employers. 
As to the foreign enterprises, their nationalisation 
is a matter for the future. To nationalise them means 
to declare direct war on the imperialists. But to declare 
such a war requires somewhat different, more favourable 
circumstances than exist at present. 
I think that at the present stage of the revolution, 
when it has not yet acquired sufficient strength, such 
a measure is premature and therefore inexpedient. 
The task just now consists not in that, but in fanning 
the flames of the agrarian revolution to the utmost, 
in ensuring the hegemony of the proletariat in 
this revolution, in strengthening Wuhan and converting 
it into a centre of struggle against all the enemies of 
the Chinese revolution. 
One must not shoulder all the tasks at once and 
risk collapsing under the strain. Particularly so, since 
the Kuomintang and its government are not adapted 
to the accomplishment of such cardinal tasks as the expropriation 
of the bourgeoisie, Chinese and foreign. 
For the accomplishment of such tasks a different 
situation, a different phase of the revolution and different 
organs of revolutionary power are required.

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP 
OF THE PROLETARIAT AND POOR 
PEASANTRY IN THE PERIOD OF 
PREPARATION FOR OCTOBER 
Reply to S. Pokrovsky 
I think that your letter of May 2 of this year provides 
neither occasion nor grounds for a reply in detail, 
point by point, so to speak. 
As a matter of fact, it offers nothing particularly 
new as compared with Yan-sky¹s letter. 
If, nevertheless, I am replying to your letter it is 
because it contains certain elements of a direct revival 
of Kamenev¹s ideas of the period of April-May 1917. 
It is only in order to expose these elements of a revival 
of Kamenev¹s ideas that I consider it necessary to reply 
briefly to your letter. 
1) You say in your letter that ³in fact, in the period 
from February to October we had the slogan of alliance 
with the whole of the peasantry,² that ³in the period 
from February to October the Party upheld and defended 
its old slogan in relation to the peasantry‹alliance 
with the whole peasantry.² 
It follows, firstly, that in the period of preparation 
for October (April-October 1917) the Bolsheviks did 
not set themselves the task of drawing a demarcation 
line between the poor peasants and the well-to-do peasants, 
but treated the peasantry as an integral whole.

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 275 
It follows, secondly, that in the period of preparation 
for October the Bolsheviks did not replace the old 
slogan, ³Dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry,² 
by a new slogan, ³Dictatorship of the proletariat and 
poor peasantry,² but maintained the old position laid 
down in Lenin¹s pamphlet Two Tactics in 1905. 
It follows, thirdly, that the Bolshevik policy of 
combating the vacillations and compromising policy of 
the Soviets in the period of preparation for October 
(March-October 1917), the vacillations of the middle 
peasantry in the Soviets and at the front, the vacillations 
between revolution and counter-revolution, the 
vacillations and compromising policy which assumed a 
particularly acute character in the July days, when the 
Soviets, headed by the Socialist-Revolutionary and 
Menshevik compromisers, joined hands with the counterrevolutionary 
generals in the attempt to isolate the Bolsheviks‹
it appears that the Bolshevik fight against 
these vacillations and the compromising policy of certain 
strata of the peasantry was pointless and absolutely 
unnecessary. 
It follows, finally, that Kamenev was right when, 
in April May 1917, he defended the old slogan of dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry, while Lenin, 
who regarded this slogan as already out-of-date and who 
proclaimed the new slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat 
and poor peasantry, was wrong. 
One need only raise these issues to realise the utter 
absurdity of your letter as a whole. 
But since you are very fond of isolated quotations 
from Lenin¹s works, let us turn to quotations. 
It does not require much effort to prove that what

J. V. S T A L I N 276 
Lenin regarded as new in the agrarian relations in Russia 
after the February Revolution, from the point of view 
of the further development of the revolution, was not 
a community of interests of the proletariat and the peasantry 
as a whole, but the cleavage between the poor 
peasantry and the well-to-do peasantry, of whom the former, 
i.e., the poor peasantry, gravitated towards the 
proletariat, whereas the latter, i.e., the well-to-do peasantry, 
followed the Provisional Government. 
Here i s what Lenin said on this score in April 
1917, in his polemic against Kamenev and Kamenev¹s 
ideas: 
³It would be impermissible for the proletarian party now* 
to place hopes in a community of interests with the peasantry² 
(see Lenin¹ s speech at the April Conference, 1917, Vol. XX, 
p. 245). 
Further: 
³Already we can discern in the decisions of a number of 
peasant congresses the idea of postponing the solution of the 
agrarian question until the Constituent Assembly; this represents a 
victory for the well-to-do peasantry,* which inclines towards the 
Cadets² (see Lenin¹s speech at the Petrograd City Conference, 
April 1917, Vol. XX, p. 176). 
Further: 
³It i s possible that the peasantry may seize a l l the land 
and the entire power. Far from forgetting this possibility, far from 
limiting my outlook to the present day alone, I definitely and 
clearly formulate the agrarian programme, taking into account 
the new phenomenon, i.e., the deeper cleavage* between the agri- 
*My italics.‹J. St.

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 277 
cultural labourers and poor peasants on the one hand, and the 
prosperous peasants on the other² (see Lenin¹s article written in 
April, ³Letters on Tactics,² Vol. XX, p. 103). 
That is what Lenin regarded as new and important 
in the new situation in the countryside after the 
February Revolution. 
That was Lenin¹s starting point in shaping the 
Party¹s policy in the period after February 1917. 
That thesis was Lenin¹s starting point when, at 
the Petrograd City Conference in April 1917, he said: 
³It was only here, on the spot, that we learned that the Soviet 
of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies had surrendered its power 
to the Provisional Government. The Soviet of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ 
Deputies represents the realisation of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and soldiers; among the latter, the majority are 
peasants. This is the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. 
But this Œdictatorship¹ has entered into an agreement with the 
bourgeoisie. And it is here that a revision of the Œold¹ Bolshevism 
is needed²* (see Vol. XX, p. 176). 
That thesis also was Lenin¹s starting point when, 
in April 1917, he wrote: 
³Whoever speaks now only of a Œrevolutionary-democratic 
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry¹ is behind the times, 
has consequently in fact gone over to the side of the petty 
bourgeoisie against the proletarian class struggle. He deserves 
to be consigned to the archive of ŒBolshevik¹ pre-revolutionary 
antiques (which might be called the archive of ŒOld Bolsheviks¹)² 
(see Vol. XX, p. 101). 
It was on this basis that there arose the slogan of 
dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry in 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 278 
place of the old slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat 
and peasantry. 
You may say, as indeed you do in your letter, that 
this is a Trotskyite skipping over of the still uncompleted 
peasant revolution; but that would be just as 
convincing as the similar objection which Kamenev 
raised against Lenin in April 1917. 
Lenin took this objection fully into account when 
he said: 
³Trotskyism says: ŒNo tsar, but a workers¹ government.¹ That 
is incorrect. The petty bourgeoisie exists, and it cannot be left 
out of account. But it consists of two sections. The poorer* section 
follows the working class² (see Vol. XX, p. 182). 
Kamenev¹s error, and now yours, consists in the inability 
to discern and emphasise the difference between 
the two sections of the petty bourgeoisie, in this case 
the peasantry; in the inability to single out the poor 
section of the peasantry from the mass of the peasantry 
as a whole, and on that basis to shape the Party¹s policy 
in the situation of the transition from the first stage 
of the revolution in 1917 to its second stage, in the 
inability to deduce from this the new slogan, the Party¹s 
second strategic slogan, concerning the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and poor peasantry. 
Let us trace in consecutive order in Lenin¹s works 
the practical history of the slogan ³Dictatorship of the 
proletariat and poor peasantry² from April to October 
1917. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 279 
April 1917: 
³The specific feature of the present situation in Russia 
consists in the transition from the first* stage of the revolution‹
which, owing to the insufficient class consciousness and 
organisation of the proletariat, placed the power in the hands 
of the bourgeoisie‹to the second stage, which must place the power 
in the hands of the proletariat and the ³poor strata of the peasantry*² 
(see Lenin¹s April Theses, Vol. XX, p. 88). 
July 1917: 
³Only the revolutionary workers, if they are supported by 
the poor peasants,* are capable of smashing the resistance of the 
capitalists and leading the people to win the land without compensation, 
to complete freedom, to victory over famine, to victory 
over war, and to a just and lasting peace² (see Vol. XXI, p. 77). 
August 1917: 
³Only the proletariat, leading the poor peasantry* (the semiproletarians, 
as our programme says), can end the war by a democratic 
peace, heal the wounds it has caused, and begin to take 
steps towards socialism, which have become absolutely essential 
and urgent‹such is the definition of our class policy now² (see Vol. 
XXI, p. 111). 
September 1917: 
³Only a dictatorship of the proletarians and the poor peasants* 
is capable of smashing the resistance of the capitalists, of 
displaying really supreme courage and determination in the exercise 
of power, and of securing the enthusiastic, selfless and truly 
heroic support of the masses both in the army and among the 
peasantry² (see Vol. XXI, p. 147). 
September-October 1917, the pamphlet Can the Bolsheviks 
Retain State Power?, in which Lenin, in controversy 
with Novaya Zhizn,63 says: 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 280 
³Either* all power to the bourgeoisie‹which you have long 
ceased to advocate, and which the bourgeoisie itself dare not 
even hint at, for it knows that already on April 20-21 the people 
overthrew that power with one heave of the shoulder, and 
would overthrow i t now with thrice that determination and 
ruthlessness. Or* power to the petty bourgeoisie, i.e., a coalition 
(alliance, agreement) between it and the bourgeoisie, for the petty 
bourgeoisie does not wish to and cannot take power alone and independently, 
as has been proved by the experience of all revolutions, 
and as is proved by economic science, which explains that 
in a capitalist country it is possible to stand for capital and it 
is possible to stand for labour, but it is impossible to stand in between. 
In Russia this coalition has for six months tried scores 
of ways but failed. Or,* finally, all power to the proletarians and 
the poor peasants* against the bourgeoisie in order to break its 
resistance. This has not yet been tried, and you, gentlemen of 
Novaya Zhizn, are dissuading the people from this, trying to frighten 
them with your own fear of the bourgeoisie. No fourth way can 
be invented² (see Vol. XXI, p. 275). 
Such are the facts. 
You ³successfully² evade all these facts and events 
in the history of the preparation for October; you 
³successfully² erase from the history of Bolshevism 
the struggle waged by the Bolsheviks in the period 
of preparation for October against the vacillations 
and the compromising policy of the ³prosperous 
peasants² who were in the Soviets at that time; you 
³successfully² bury Lenin¹s slogan of dictatorship of 
the proletariat and poor peasantry, and at the same 
time imagine that this is not to do violence to history, 
to Leninism. 
From these quotations, which could be multiplied, 
you must see that the Bolsheviks took as their starting

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 281 
point after February 1917 not the peasantry as a whole, 
but the poor section of the peasantry; that they marched 
towards October not under the old slogan of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry, but under the 
new slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor 
peasantry. 
From this it is evident that the Bolsheviks put this 
slogan into effect in a fight against the vacillations 
and compromising policy of the Soviets, against the vacillations 
and compromising policy of a certain section 
of the peasantry inside the Soviets, against the vacillations 
and compromising policy of certain parties representing 
petty-bourgeois democracy and known as Socialist-
Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 
From this it is evident that without the new slogan 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry 
we would have been unable to assemble a sufficiently 
powerful political army, one capable of overcoming 
the compromising policy of the Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and the Mensheviks, of neutralising the vacillations of a 
certain section of the peasantry, of overthrowing the 
power of the bourgeoisie, and of thus making it possible 
to carry the bourgeois revolution to completion. 
From this it is evident that ³we marched towards 
October and achieved victory in October together with 
the poor peasantry against the resistance of the kulaks 
(also peasants) and with the middle peasantry vacillating² 
(see my reply to Yan-sky*). 
Thus, it follows that in April 1917, as also during 
the whole period of preparation for October, it was 
* See this volume, pp. 218-19.‹Ed.

J. V. S T A L I N 282 
Lenin who was right, and not Kamenev; and you, by 
now reviving Kamenev¹s ideas, seem to be getting into 
not very good company. 
2) As against all that has been said above you quote 
Lenin¹s words to the effect that in October 1917 we took 
power with the support of the peasantry as a whole. 
That we took power with a certain amount of support 
from the peasantry as a whole is quite true. But you 
forgot to add a ³detail,² namely, that the peasantry as 
a whole supported us in October, and after October, only 
in so far as we carried the bourgeois revolution to completion. 
That is a very important ³detail,² which in the 
present instance settles the issue. To ³forget² such an 
important ³detail² and thus slur over a most important 
issue is impermissible for a Bolshevik. 
From your letter it is evident that you counterpose 
what Lenin said about the support of the peasantry as 
a whole to the Party¹s slogan of ³Dictatorship of the 
proletariat and poor peasantry,² which was also advanced 
by Lenin. But in order to counterpose these words 
of Lenin to the previous quotations from the works of 
Lenin, in order to have grounds for refuting the previous 
quotations from Lenin on the slogan of dictatorship 
of the proletariat and poor peasantry by the words 
you quote from Lenin about the peasantry as a whole, 
two things, at least, must be proved. 
Firstly. It must be proved that the completion of 
the bourgeois revolution was the main thing in the October 
Revolution. Lenin considered that the completion 
of the bourgeois revolution was a ³by-product² of the 
October Revolution, which fulfilled this task ³in passing.² 
You must first of all refute this thesis of Lenin¹s

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 283 
and prove that the main thing in the October Revolution 
was not the overthrow of the power of the bourgeoisie 
and the transfer of power to the proletariat, but the 
completion of the bourgeois revolution. Try to prove 
that, and if you do I shall be ready to admit that from 
April to October 1917 the Party¹s slogan was not the 
dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry, but 
the dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. 
From your letter it is evident that you do not think 
it possible to undertake this more than risky task; you 
try, however, to prove ³in passing² that on one of the 
most important questions of the October Revolution, 
the question of peace, we were supported by all the peasantry 
as a whole. That, of course, is untrue. It is quite 
untrue. On the question of peace you have slipped into 
the viewpoint of the philistine. As a matter of fact the 
question of peace was for us at that time a question of 
power, for only with the transfer of power to the proletariat 
could we count on extricating ourselves from 
the imperialist war. 
You must have forgotten Lenin¹s words, that ³the 
only way to stop the war is by the transfer of power 
to another class,² and that ³ŒDown with the war¹ 
does not mean flinging away your bayonets. It means 
the transfer of power to another class² (see Lenin¹s 
speech at the Petrograd City Conference, April 1917, 
Vol. XX, pp. 181 and 178). 
Thus, one thing or the other: either you must prove 
that the main thing in the October Revolution was 
the completion of the bourgeois revolution, or you cannot 
prove it; in the latter case the obvious conclusion 
is that the peasantry as a whole could support us in

J. V. S T A L I N 284 
October only in so far as we carried the bourgeois revolution 
to completion, doing away with the monarchy, 
and with the property and regime of the landlords. 
Secondly. You must prove that the Bolsheviks could 
have secured the support of the peasantry as a whole 
in October and after October, in so far as they carried 
the bourgeois revolution to completion, without systematically 
putting into effect the slogan of dictatorship 
of the proletariat and poor peasantry during the whole 
period of preparation for October; without a systematic 
struggle, arising from this slogan, against the compromising 
policy of the petty-bourgeois parties; without a 
systematic exposure, arising from the same slogan, of 
the vacillations of certain strata of the peasantry and 
of their representatives in the Soviets. 
Try to prove that. In point of fact, why did we succeed 
in securing the support of the peasantry as a whole 
in October and after October? Because we had the possibility 
of carrying the bourgeois revolution to completion. 
Why did we have that possibility? Because we succeeded 
in overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie 
and replacing it by the power of the proletariat, which 
alone is able to carry the bourgeois revolution to completion. 
Why did we succeed in overthrowing the power of 
the bourgeoisie and establishing the power of the proletariat? 
Because we prepared for October under the 
slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry; 
because, proceeding from this slogan, we waged a 
systematic struggle against the compromising policy 
of the petty-bourgeois parties; because, proceeding from

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 285 
this slogan, we waged a systematic struggle against the 
vacillations of the middle peasantry in the Soviets; 
because only with such a slogan could we overcome the 
vacillations of the middle peasant, defeat the compromising 
policy of the petty-bourgeois parties, and rally a 
political army capable of waging the struggle for the 
transfer of power to the proletariat. 
It scarcely needs proof that without these preliminary 
conditions, which determined the fate of the October 
Revolution, we could not have won the support of 
the peasantry as a whole for the task of completing 
the bourgeois revolution, either in October or after 
October. 
That is how the combination of peasant wars with 
the proletarian revolution should be understood. 
That is why to counterpose the support of the peasantry 
as a whole in October and after October as regards 
completing the bourgeois revolution to the fact that the 
preparation for the October Revolution under the slogan 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry 
means to understand nothing of Leninism. 
Your principal error is that you have failed to understand 
either the fact of the interweaving during the 
October Revolution of socialist tasks with the tasks of 
completing the bourgeois revolution, or the mechanics 
of fulfilling the various demands of the October Revolution 
arising from the Party¹s second strategic slogan, 
the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor 
peasantry. 
Reading your letter one might think that i t was 
not we who took the peasantry into the service of the 
proletarian revolution, but, on the contrary, that i t

J. V. S T A L I N 286 
was ³the peasantry as a whole,² including the kulaks, 
who took the Bolsheviks into their service. Things 
would go badly with the Bolsheviks if they so easily 
³entered² the service of non-proletarian classes. 
Kamenev¹s ideas of the period of April 1917‹that 
is what is fettering you. 
3) You assert that Stalin does not see any difference 
between the situation in 1905 and the situation in February 
1917. That, of course, is not to be taken seriously. 
I never said that, and could not have said it. In my 
letter I said merely that the Party¹s slogan on the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry, issued in 
1905, received confirmation in the February Revolution 
of 1917. That, of course, is true. That is exactly how 
Lenin described the situation in his article ³Peasants 
and Workers² in August 1917: 
³Only the proletariat and the peasantry can overthrow the 
monarchy‹such was the fundamental definition of our class 
policy for that time (i.e., 1905‹J. St.). And that definition 
was a correct one. February and March have confirmed 
this once again²* (see Vol. XXI, p. 111). 
You simply want to find fault. 
4) You try, further, to convict Stalin of contradicting 
himself, by counterposing his thesis on the 
compromising policy of the middle peasant before October 
to a quotation from Stalin¹s pamphlet Problems of 
Leninism, which speaks of the possibility of building 
socialism jointly with the middle peasantry after the 
dictatorship of the proletariat has been consolidated. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

THE SLOGAN OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT 287 
It does not require much effort to prove that such 
an identification of two different phenomena is utterly 
unscientific. The middle peasant before October, when 
the bourgeoisie was in power, and the middle peasant 
after the dictatorship of the proletariat has been consolidated, 
when the bourgeoisie has already been overthrown 
and expropriated, when the co-operative movement has 
developed and the principal means of production are 
concentrated in the hands of the proletariat, are two 
different things. To identify these two kinds of middle 
peasant and to put them on a par means to examine 
phenomena out of connection with their historical 
setting and to lose all sense of perspective. It is 
something like the Zinoviev manner of mixing up all 
dates and periods when quoting. 
If that is what is called ³revolutionary dialectics,² 
i t must be admitted that Pokrovsky has broken all 
records for ³dialectical² quibbling. 
5) I shall not touch on the remaining questions, 
for I think they have been exhaustively dealt with in 
the correspondence with Yan-sky.

AND THE TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 
Speech Deliverd at the Tenth Sitting, 
Eighth Plenum of the E.C.C.I.,64 
May 24, 1927 
I 
SOME MINOR QUESTIONS 
Comrades, I must apologise for having arrived late 
at today¹s sitting of the Executive Committee and so 
could not hear the whole of the speech that Trotsky read 
here in the Executive Committee. 
I think, however, that in the last few days Trotsky 
has submitted to the Executive Committee such a mass 
of literature, theses and letters on the Chinese question 
that we cannot lack material for criticism of the opposition. 
I shall therefore base my criticism of Trotsky¹s errors 
on these documents, and I have no doubt that it will at 
the same time be a criticism of the fundamentals of the 
speech Trotsky delivered today. 
I shall try, as far as possible, to keep the personal element 
out of the controversy. Trotsky¹s and Zinoviev¹s 
personal attacks on individual members of the Political 
Bureau of the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) and of the Presidium 
of the E.C.C.I. are not worth wasting time on. 
Trotsky, evidently, would like to pose at the meetings 
of the Executive Committee of the Comintern as a sort 
of hero so as to turn its examination of the questions of

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 289 
the war danger, the Chinese revolution, etc., into an examination 
of the question of Trotsky. I think that Trotsky 
does not deserve so much consideration. (A voice from the 
audience: ³Quite right!²) All the more so as he resembles 
an actor rather than a hero; and an actor should not be 
confused with a hero under any circumstances. 
I say nothing of the fact that when people like Trotsky 
and Zinoviev, whom the Seventh Enlarged Plenum 
of the Executive Committee found guilty of a Social- 
Democratic deviation, abuse the Bolsheviks for all they are 
worth, there is nothing offensive in this to Bukharin or 
to Stalin. On the contrary, I should be very deeply offended 
if semi-Mensheviks of the Trotsky and Zinoviev type 
did not abuse, but praised me. 
Nor shall I dilate on the question of whether the opposition, 
by its present factional statements, has violated 
the undertakings it gave on October 16,1926. Trotsky 
asserts that the opposition¹s declaration of October 16, 
926, gives him the right to uphold his views. That, of 
course, is true. But if Trotsky means to assert that 
that is all the declaration stipulates, this can only be called 
sophistry. 
The opposition¹s declaration of October 16 speaks not 
only of the right of the opposition to uphold its views, but 
also of the fact that these views may be upheld only within 
the limits permitted by the Party, that factionalism 
must be discarded and put an end to, that the opposition 
is obliged ³to submit unreservedly² to the will of the Party 
and the decisions of the C.C., and that the opposition 
must not only submit to these decisions, but must conscientiously 
³carry them out.² 
In view of all this, is any further proof needed that

J. V. S T A L I N 290 
the opposition has most grossly violated and torn up its 
declaration of October 16, 1926? 
Nor shall I dilate on the unseemly and grossly slanderous 
distortions of the position of the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) 
and the Comintern on the Chinese question contained 
in the numerous theses, articles and speeches of the 
opposition. Trotsky and Zinoviev never cease to allege 
that the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) and the Comintern have upheld 
and continue to uphold a policy of ³support² for the 
national bourgeoisie in China. 
It scarcely needs proof that this allegation of Trotsky¹s 
and Zinoviev¹s is a fabrication, a slander, a deliberate 
distortion of the facts. As a matter of fact, the C.C., 
C.P.S.U.(B.) and the Comintern upheld not the policy of 
supporting the national bourgeoisie, but a policy of utilising 
the national bourgeoisie so long as the revolution in 
China was the revolution of an all-national united front, 
and they later replaced that policy by a policy of armed 
struggle against the national bourgeoisie when the revolution 
in China became an agrarian revolution, and the 
national bourgeoisie began to desert the revolution. 
To convince oneself of this, one has only to examine 
such documents as the resolution of the Seventh Enlarged 
Plenum, the appeal of the Executive Committee of the 
Comintern,65 Stalin¹s theses for propagandists,* and, lastly, 
Bukharin¹s theses submitted the other day to the Presidium 
of the Executive Committee of the Comintern. 
It is indeed the misfortune of the opposition that it 
cannot manage without tittle-tattle and distortions. 
Let us pass to the matter in hand.

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 291 
II 
THE AGRARIAN-PEASANT REVOLUTION 
AS THE BASIS OF THE BOURGEOISDEMOCRATIC 
REVOLUTION 
Trotsky¹s fundamental error is that he does not understand 
the character and meaning of the Chinese revolution. 
The Comintern holds that survivals of feudalism 
are the predominating factor in the oppression in China 
at the present moment, a factor stimulating the agrarian 
revolution. The Comintern holds that the survivals of 
feudalism in the Chinese countryside and the entire militarist-
bureaucratic superstructure resting on them, with all 
the tuchuns, governors, generals, Chang Tso-lins and so 
forth, constitute the basis on which the present agrarian 
revolution has arisen and is unfolding. 
If in a number of provinces 70 per cent of the peasants¹ 
earnings go to the landlords and the gentry, if the landlords, 
armed and unarmed, are not only the economic but 
also the administrative and judicial power, if medieval 
purchase and sale of women and children is still practised 
in a number of provinces‹then it cannot but be 
admitted that feudal survivals are the principal form of 
oppression in the Chinese provinces. 
And precisely because feudal survivals, with their 
entire militarist-bureaucratic superstructure, are the principal 
form of oppression in China, China is now passing 
through an agrarian revolution of gigantic power and 
scope. 
And what is the agrarian revolution? It is, indeed, 
the basis and content of the bourgeois-democratic revolution.

J. V. S T A L I N 292 
That is precisely why the Comintern says that China 
is now passing through a bourgeois-democratic revolution. 
But the bourgeois-democratic revolution in China is 
directed not only against feudal survivals; it is directed 
also against imperialism. 
Why? 
Because imperialism, with all its financial and military 
might, is the force in China that supports, inspires, 
fosters and preserves the feudal survivals, together 
with their entire militarist-bureaucratic superstructure. 
Because it is impossible to abolish the feudal survivals 
in China without at the same time waging a revolutionary 
struggle against imperialism in China. 
Because anyone who wants to abolish the feudal survivals 
in China must necessarily raise his hand against 
imperialism and the imperialist groups in China. 
Because the feudal survivals in China cannot be 
smashed and abolished without waging a determined 
struggle against imperialism. 
That is precisely why the Comintern says that the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution in China is at the same 
time an anti-imperialist revolution. 
Thus, the present revolution in China is a combination 
of two streams of the revolutionary movement‹ 
the movement against feudal survivals and the movement 
against imperialism. The bourgeois-democratic revolution 
in China is a combination of the struggle against 
feudal survivals and the struggle against imperialism. 
That is the starting point of the whole line of the Comintern 
(and hence of the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.)) on the questions 
of the Chinese revolution.

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 293 
And what is the starting point of Trotsky¹s attitude 
on the Chinese question? It is the direct opposite of the 
Comintern¹s standpoint, as just expounded. Trotsky 
either refuses altogether to recognise the existence of feudal 
survivals in China or does not attach decisive importance 
to them. Trotsky (and hence the opposition), underestimating 
the strength and significance of feudal-bureaucratic 
oppression in China, supposes that the principal reason 
for the Chinese national revolution is China¹s statecustoms 
dependence on the imperialist countries. 
Allow me to refer to the theses which Trotsky submitted 
to the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) and the Executive Committee 
of the Comintern a few days ago. These theses of 
Trotsky¹s are entitled ³The Chinese Revolution and 
Stalin¹s Theses.² 
Here is what Trotsky says in these theses: 
³Fundamentally untenable is Bukharin¹s attempt to justify 
his opportunist compromising line by references to the alleged 
predominating role of Œfeudal survivals¹ in China¹s economy. Even 
if Bukharin¹s estimate of Chinese economy were based upon an 
economic analysis, and not upon scholastic definitions, all the 
same Œfeudal survivals¹ could not justify the policy which so manifestly 
facilitated the April coup. The Chinese revolution bears 
a national-bourgeois character for the basic reason that the development 
of the productive forces of Chinese capitalism is being 
blocked by China¹s state-customs* dependence on the imperialist 
countries² (see Trotsky¹s ³The Chinese Revolution and Stalin¹s 
Theses²). 
A superficial perusal of this passage might lead one 
to think that it is not the Comintern line on the 
question of the character of the Chinese revolution that 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 294 
Trotsky is combating, but Bukharin¹s ³compromising 
policy.² That, of course, is not true. Actually, 
what we have in this quotation i s a denial of the 
³predominating role² of the feudal survivals in China. 
Actually, what is asserted here is that the agrarian 
revolution now developing in China is a revolution of 
the top stratum, an anti-customs revolution, so to 
speak. 
The talk about Bukharin¹s ³compromising policy² 
was needed here by Trotsky in order to cover up his departure 
from the line of the Comintern. It is, I will say bluntly, 
Trotsky¹s usual fraudulent device. 
It follows therefore, according to Trotsky, that the 
feudal survivals in China with their entire militaristbureaucratic 
superstructure, are not the mainspring of 
the Chinese revolution at the present moment, but a secondary 
and insignificant factor, which only deserves to 
be mentioned in inverted commas. 
It follows therefore, according to Trotsky, that the 
³basic reason² for the national revolution in China 
is China¹s customs dependence on the imperialists, and 
that, owing to this, the revolution in China is primarily, 
so to speak, an anti-customs revolution. 
Such is the starting point of Trotsky¹s conception. 
Such is Trotsky¹s viewpoint on the character of the 
Chinese revolution. 
Permit me to observe that this viewpoint is that of a 
state counsellor of ³His Highness² Chang Tso-lin. 
If Trotsky¹s viewpoint is correct, then it must be admitted 
that Chang Tso-lin and Chiang Kai-shek are right 
in not desiring either an agrarian or a workers¹ revolution, 
and in striving only for the abolition of the unequal

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 295 
treaties and the establishment of customs autonomy for 
China. 
Trotsky has slid over to the viewpoint of the officials 
of Chang Tso-lin and Chiang Kai-shek. 
If the survivals of feudalism have to be put in inverted 
commas; if the Comintern is wrong in declaring 
that the feudal survivals are of predominant importance 
at the present stage of the revolution; if the basis for the 
Chinese revolution is customs dependence and not the 
struggle against feudal survivals and against imperialism, 
which supports them‹what then remains of the agrarian 
revolution in China? 
Where does the agrarian revolution in China, with 
its demand for the confiscation of the landlords¹ land, 
come from? What grounds are there, in that case, for regarding 
the Chinese revolution as a bourgeois-democratic 
revolution? Is it not a fact that the agrarian revolution 
is the basis of the bourgeois-democratic revolution? Surely, 
the agrarian revolution cannot have dropped from the 
skies? 
Is it not a fact that millions and tens of millions of 
peasants are involved in a gigantic agrarian revolution in 
such provinces as Hunan, Hupeh, Honan, etc., where the 
peasants are establishing their own rule, their own courts, 
their own self-defence bodies, driving out the landlords and 
settling accounts with them ³in plebeian fashion²? 
Where do we get such a powerful agrarian movement 
from, if feudal-militarist oppression is not the predominant 
form of oppression in China? 
How could this mighty movement of tens of millions 
of peasants have assumed at the same time an anti-imperialist 
character, if we are not to admit that imperialism

J. V. S T A L I N 296 
is the main ally of the feudal-militarist oppressors of the 
Chinese people? 
Is it not a fact that the peasant association in Hunan 
alone has now over two and a half million members? And 
how many of them are there already in Hupeh and Honan, 
and how many will there be in the very near future in 
other Chinese provinces? 
And what about the ³Red Spears,² the ³Tightened 
Belts¹ Associations,² etc.‹can they be a figment of the 
imagination, and not a reality? 
Can it be seriously maintained that the agrarian revolution 
embracing tens of millions of peasants with the 
slogan of confiscation of the landlords¹ land is directed 
not against real and undeniable feudal survivals, but 
against imaginary ones, in inverted commas? 
Is it not obvious that Trotsky has slid over to the viewpoint 
of the officials of ³His Highness² Chang Tso-lin? 
Thus we have two basic lines: 
a) the line of the Comintern, which takes into account 
the existence of feudal survivals in China, as the predominant 
form of oppression, the decisive importance of 
the powerful agrarian movement, the connection of the 
feudal survivals with imperialism, and the bourgeoisdemocratic 
character of the Chinese revolution with its 
struggle spearheaded against imperialism; 
b) the line of Trotsky, which denies the predominant 
importance of feudal-militarist oppression, fails to appreciate 
the decisive importance of the agrarian revolutionary 
movement in China, and attributes the antiimperialist 
character of the Chinese revolution solely to 
the interests of Chinese capitalism, which is demanding 
customs independence for China.

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 297 
The basic error of Trotsky (and hence of the opposition) 
is that he underestimates the agrarian revolution in China, 
does not understand the bourgeois-democratic character 
of that revolution, denies the existence of the preconditions 
for an agrarian movement in China, embracing 
many millions, and underestimates the role of the peasantry 
in the Chinese revolution. 
This error is not a new one with Trotsky. It has 
been the most characteristic feature of his whole line 
throughout the period of his struggle against Bolshevism. 
Underestimation of the role of the peasantry in the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution is an error which has pursued 
Trotsky since 1905, an error which was particularly 
glaring prior to the February Revolution of 1917, and 
which clings to him to this day. 
Permit me to refer to a few facts relating to Trotsky¹s 
struggle against Leninism, on the eve of the February 
Revolution in 1917, for example, when we were advancing 
towards the victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
in Russia. 
Trotsky asserted at that time that, since differentiation 
among the peasantry had increased, since imperialism 
was now predominant and the proletariat was pitting 
itself against the bourgeois nation, the role of the 
peasantry would decline and the agrarian revolution would 
not have the importance which had been ascribed to it 
in 1905. 
What did Lenin say in reply to that? Let me quote a 
passage from an article written by Lenin in 1915 on the 
role of the peasantry in the bourgeois-democratic revolution 
in Russia:

J. V. S T A L I N 298 
³This original theory of Trotsky¹s (referring to Trotsky¹s 
³permanent revolution²‹J. St.) borrows from the Bolsheviks 
their call for a resolute revolutionary struggle by the proletariat 
and for the conquest of political power by the latter, and 
from the Mensheviks the Œdenial¹ of the role of the peasantry. 
The peasantry, he says, has split up into strata, has become 
differentiated; its potential revolutionary role has steadily declined; 
a Œnational¹ revolution is impossible in Russia; Œwe are 
living in the era of imperialism,¹ and Œimperialism pits, not the 
bourgeois nation against the old regime, but the proletariat 
against the bourgeois nation.¹ 
³Here we have an amusing example of Œword juggling¹: imperialism! 
If, in Russia, the proletariat is already pitted against 
the Œbourgeois nation,¹ then that means that Russia is directly 
facing a socialist revolution!! Then the slogan Œconfiscation of 
the landlords¹ land¹ (which Trotsky, after the Conference of January 
1912, put forward again in 1915) is untrue, and we must 
speak not of a Œrevolutionary workers¹ government, but of a 
Œworkers¹ socialist¹ government!! To what lengths Trotsky¹s 
confusion goes may be seen from his phrase that the proletariat 
would, by its determination, carry along with it the Œnon-proletarian 
(!) popular masses¹ (No. 217)!! Trotsky has not stopped to 
think that if the proletariat carries along with it the non-proletarian 
masses of the countryside for confiscation of the landlords¹ 
land and overthrows the monarchy, that will be the completion of 
the Œnational bourgeois revolution¹ in Russia, that will be the 
revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry!* 
³The whole decade‹the great decade‹1905-1915‹has demonstrated 
that there are two, and only two, class lines for the 
Russian revolution. The differentiation of the peasantry has intensified 
the class struggle within it, has awakened very many 
politically dormant elements, has brought the rural proletariat 
closer to the urban proletariat (the Bolsheviks have been 
insisting on the separate organisation of the former since 1906, 
and introduced this demand in the resolution of the Stockholm, 
* My italics.‹J. St.

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 299 
Menshevik Congress). But the antagonism between the Œpeasantry¹ 
and the Markovs-Romanovs-Khvostovs has become stronger, 
more developed, more acute. This truth is so obvious that even 
thousands of phrases in scores of Trotsky¹s Paris articles cannot 
Œrefute¹ it. Trotsky is in fact helping the liberal labour politicians 
in Russia who understand Œdenial¹ of the role of the peasantry to 
mean refusal to rouse the peasants to revolution! And that just 
now is the crux of the matter² (see Vol. XVIII, pp. 317-18). 
It is this peculiarity of Trotsky¹s scheme‹the fact 
that he sees the bourgeoisie and sees the proletariat, but 
does not notice the peasantry and does not understand 
its role in the bourgeois-democratic revolution‹it is precisely 
this peculiarity that constitutes the opposition¹s 
principal error on the Chinese question. 
It is just this that constitutes the ³semi-Menshevism² 
of Trotsky and of the opposition in the question of the 
character of the Chinese revolution. 
From this principal error stem all the other errors 
of the opposition, all the confusion in its theses on the 
Chinese question. 
III 
THE RIGHT KUOMINTANG IN NANKING, 
WHICH MASSACRES COMMUNISTS, 
AND THE LEFT KUOMINTANG IN WUHAN, 
WHICH MAINTAINS AN ALLIANCE WITH 
THE COMMUNISTS 
Take, for example, the question of Wuhan. The Comintern¹s 
position on the revolutionary role of Wuhan is 
well known and clear. Since China is passing through an 
agrarian revolution, since the victory of the agrarian revolution 
will mean the victory of the bourgeois-democratic

J. V. S T A L I N 300 
revolution, the victory of a revolutionary dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry, and since Nanking 
is the centre of national counter-revolution and Wuhan 
the centre of the revolutionary movement in China, the 
Wuhan Kuomintang must be supported and the Communists 
must participate in this Kuomintang and in its 
revolutionary government, provided that the leading 
role of the proletariat and its party is ensured both inside 
and outside the Kuomintang. 
Is the present Wuhan government the organ of a revolutionary-
democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and 
peasantry? No, it is not such an organ as yet, and will 
not soon become one. But it has every chance of developing 
into such an organ, given the further development 
of the revolution and the success of this revolution. 
Such is the position of the Comintern. 
Quite different is the way Trotsky sees the matter. 
He considers that Wuhan is not the centre of the revolutionary 
movement, but a ³fiction.² Asked what the 
Left Kuomintang is at this moment, Trotsky replies: ³So 
far it is nothing, or practically nothing.² 
Let us assume that Wuhan is a fiction. But if Wuhan 
is a fiction, why does Trotsky not insist on a determined 
struggle against this fiction? Since when have Communists 
been supporting fictions, participating in fictions, 
standing at the head of fictions, and so on? Is it not a 
fact that Communists are in duty bound to fight against 
fictions? Is it not a fact that if Communists refrained from 
fighting against fictions, it would mean deceiving the proletariat 
and the peasantry? Why, then, does Trotsky not 
propose that the Communists should fight this fiction, 
if only by immediate withdrawal from the Wuhan Kuo

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 301 
mintang and the Wuhan government? Why does Trotsky 
propose that they should remain within this fiction, and 
not withdraw from it? Where is the logic in this? 
Is not this ³logical² incongruity to be explained by 
the fact that Trotsky took up a swaggering attitude towards 
Wuhan and called it a fiction, and then got cold 
feet and shrank from drawing the appropriate conclusion 
from his theses? 
Or take Zinoviev, for example. In his theses, distributed 
at the plenum of the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) in April 
of this year, Zinoviev characterised the Kuomintang 
in Wuhan as a Kemalist government of the 1920 period. 
But a Kemalist government is a government which fights 
the workers and peasants, a government in which there 
is not, and cannot be, any place for Communists. It would 
seem that only one conclusion could be drawn from such 
a characterisation of Wuhan: a determined struggle 
against Wuhan, the overthrow of the Wuhan government. 
But that is what ordinary people, with ordinary 
human logic, might think. 
That is not what Zinoviev thinks. Characterising the 
Wuhan government in Hankow as a Kemalist government, 
he at the same time proposes that this government 
should be given the most energetic support, that the 
Communists should not resign from i t , should not 
withdraw from the Kuomintang in Wuhan, and so on. 
He says outright: 
³It is necessary to render the most energetic and all-round 
assistance to Hankow and to organise resistance from there against 
the Cavaignacs. In the immediate future efforts should be concentrated 
precisely on facilitating organisation and consolidation 
in Hankow² (see Zinoviev¹s theses).

J. V. S T A L I N 302 
Understand that if you can! 
Trotsky says that Wuhan, i.e., Hankow, is a fiction. 
Zinoviev, on the contrary, asserts that Wuhan is a Kemalist 
government. The conclusion that should be drawn from 
this is that the fiction must be fought, or a fight undertaken 
to overthrow the Wuhan government. But both 
Trotsky and Zinoviev shrink from the conclusion that 
follows inevitably from their premises, and Zinoviev 
goes even further and recommends rendering ³the most 
energetic and all-round assistance to Hankow.² 
What does all this show? It shows that the opposition 
has got entangled in contradictions. It has lost the capacity 
to think logically, it has lost all sense of perspective. 
Confusion of mind and loss of all sense of perspective 
on the Wuhan question‹such is the position of Trotsky 
and the opposition, if confusion can be called a position 
at all. 
IV 
SOVIETS OF WORKERS¹ AND PEASANTS¹ 
DEPUTIES IN CHINA 
Or take, as another example, the question of Soviets 
of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in China. 
On the question of organising Soviets, we have the 
three resolutions adopted by the Second Congress of the 
Comintern: Lenin¹s theses on the formation of non-proletarian, 
peasants¹ Soviets in backward countries, Roy¹s 
theses on the formation of workers¹ and peasants¹ 
Soviets in such countries as China and India, and the special 
theses on ³When and in What Circumstances Soviets 
of Workers¹ Deputies May Be Formed.²

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 303 
Lenin¹s theses deal with the formation of ³peasants¹,² 
³people¹s,² non-proletarian Soviets in countries like those 
of Central Asia, where there is no industrial proletariat, 
or practically none. Not a word is said in Lenin¹s theses 
about the formation of Soviets of workers¹ deputies in 
such countries. Furthermore, Lenin¹s theses hold that 
one of the essential conditions for the development and 
formation of ³peasants¹,² ³people¹s,² Soviets in backward 
countries is the rendering of direct support to the revolution 
in such countries by the proletariat of the U.S.S.R. 
It is clear that these theses envisage not China or India‹ 
where there is a certain minimum of industrial proletariat, 
and where, under certain conditions, the creation of 
workers¹ Soviets is a pre-condition for the formation of 
peasants¹ Soviets‹but other, more backward countries, 
such as Persia, etc. 
Roy¹s theses chiefly envisage China and India, where 
there is an industrial proletariat. These theses propose 
the formation, in certain circumstances‹in the period 
of transition from the bourgeois to the proletarian revolution‹
of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies. 
It is clear that these theses have a direct bearing on China. 
The special theses of the Second Congress, entitled 
³When and in What Circumstances Soviets of Workers¹ 
Deputies May Be Formed,² deal with the role of 
Soviets of workers¹ deputies on the basis of the experience 
of the revolutions in Russia and Germany. These 
theses affirm that ³without a proletarian revolution, Soviets 
inevitably turn into a travesty of Soviets.² It is clear 
that when considering the question of immediately forming 
Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in 
China, we must take these latter theses also into account.

J. V. S T A L I N 304 
How do matters stand with the question of immediately 
forming Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in 
China, if we take into account both the present situation 
in China, with the existence of the Wuhan Kuomintang 
as the centre of the revolutionary movement, and the directives 
in the last two theses of the Second Congress of 
the Comintern. 
To form Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies 
at the present time in the area of activity, say, of the 
Wuhan government, would mean establishing a dual power 
and issuing the slogan of a struggle for the overthrow 
of the Left Kuomintang and the establishment of a new, 
Soviet power in China. 
Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies are organs 
of struggle for the overthrow of the existing power, organs 
of struggle for a new power. The appearance of Soviets of 
workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies cannot but create a dual 
power, and, given a dual power, the question whom 
all power should belong to cannot but become an acute 
issue. 
How did matters stand in Russia in March-April- 
May-June 1917? There was at that time the Provisional 
Government, which possessed half the power‹but 
the more real power, very likely, because it still had the 
support of the army. Side by side with this there were 
the Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies, which 
also possessed something like half the power, although not 
such a real power as that of the Provisional Government. 
The slogan of the Bolsheviks at that time was to depose 
the Provisional Government and to transfer all power to 
the Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies. None of 
the Bolsheviks thought of entering the Provisional Govern

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 305 
ment, for you cannot enter a government that you are 
out to overthrow. 
Can it be said that the situation in Russia in March- 
June 1917 was similar to the situation in China today? 
No, it cannot. It cannot be said, not only because Russia 
at that time was facing a proletarian revolution while 
China now is facing a bourgeois-democratic revolution, 
but also because at that time the Provisional Government 
in Russia was a counter-revolutionary and imperialist 
government, while the present Wuhan government is 
a government that is anti-imperialist and revolutionary, 
in the bourgeois-democratic meaning of the word. 
What does the opposition propose in this connection? 
It proposes the immediate creation in China of Soviets 
of workers¹, peasants¹ and soldiers¹ deputies, as centres 
of organisation of the revolutionary movement. But 
Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies are not only centres 
of organisation of the revolutionary movement. They 
are, first and foremost, organs of an uprising against the 
existing power, organs for the establishment of a new, 
revolutionary power. The opposition does not understand 
that only as organs of an uprising, only as organs of a new 
power, can Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies become 
centres of the revolutionary movement. Failing this, 
Soviets of workers¹ deputies become a fiction, an appendage 
of the existing power, as was the case in Germany 
in 1918 and in Russia in July 1917. 
Does the opposition understand that the formation 
of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in China at 
the present time would mean the establishment of dual 
power, shared by the Soviets and the Wuhan government,

J. V. S T A L I N 306 
and would necessarily and inevitably lead to a call for 
the overthrow of the Wuhan government? 
I doubt very much whether Zinoviev understands 
this simple matter. But Trotsky understands it perfectly 
well, for he plainly says in his theses: ³The slogan of 
Soviets means a call for the setting up of effective organs 
of power, through a transitional regime of dual power² (see 
Trotsky¹s theses, ³The Chinese Revolution and Stalin¹s 
Theses²). 
It follows, therefore, that if we were to set up Soviets 
in China, we should at the same time be setting up a ³regime 
of dual power,² overthrowing the Wuhan government 
and forming a new, revolutionary power. Trotsky 
is here obviously taking as a model the events in the history 
of the Russian revolution in the period prior to 
October 1917. At that time we really did have a dual 
power, and we really were working to overthrow the 
Provisional Government. 
But I have already said that none of us at that time 
thought of entering the Provisional Government. Why, 
then, does Trotsky not propose now that the Communists 
should immediately withdraw from the Kuomintang and 
the Wuhan government? How can you set up Soviets, how 
can you set up a regime of dual power, and at the same 
time belong to that selfsame Wuhan government you intend 
to overthrow? Trotsky¹s theses provide no answer 
to this question. 
It is clear that Trotsky has got himself hopelessly entangled 
in the labyrinth of his own contradictions. He has 
confused a bourgeois-democratic revolution with a proletarian 
revolution. He has ³forgotten² that, far from being 
completed, far from being victorious as yet, the bour

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 307 
geois-democratic revolution in China is only in its initial 
stage of development. Trotsky does not understand that 
to withdraw support from the Wuhan government, to 
issue the slogan of a dual power and to proceed to overthrow 
the Wuhan government at the present time, 
through the immediate formation of Soviets, would 
mean rendering direct and indubitable support to Chiang 
Kai-shek and Chang Tso-lin. 
How then, we are asked, is the formation of Soviets 
of workers¹ deputies in Russia in 1905 to be understood? 
Were we not then passing through a bourgeois-democratic 
revolution? 
Firstly, however, there were at that time only two 
Soviets‹in St. Petersburg and in Moscow; and the existence 
of two Soviets did not yet mean the setting up of 
a system of Soviet power in Russia. 
Secondly, the St. Petersburg and Moscow Soviets of 
that period were organs of an uprising against the old, 
tsarist power, which once more confirms that Soviets 
cannot be regarded solely as centres for organising the 
revolution, that they can be such centres only if they are 
organs of an uprising and organs of a new power. 
Thirdly, the history of workers¹ Soviets shows that 
such Soviets can exist and develop only if favourable conditions 
exist for a direct transition from bourgeois-democratic 
revolution to proletarian revolution, if, consequently, 
favourable conditions exist for a transition from bourgeois 
rule to the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Was it not because these favourable conditions did not 
exist that the workers¹ Soviets in St. Petersburg and Moscow 
perished in 1905, just as did the workers¹ Soviets in 
Germany in 1918?

J. V. S T A L I N 308 
It is possible that there would have been no Soviets 
in Russia in 1905 if there had been at that time a broad 
revolutionary organisation in Russia similar to the Left 
Kuomintang in China today. But no such organisation 
could have existed in Russia at that time, because there 
were no elements of national oppression among the Russian 
workers and peasants; the Russians themselves oppressed 
other nationalities, and an organisation like the 
Left Kuomintang can arise only when there is national 
oppression by foreign imperialists, which draws the revolutionary 
elements of the country together into one 
broad organisation. 
One must be blind to deny to the Left Kuomintang 
the role of an organ of revolutionary struggle, an organ of 
revolt against feudal survivals and imperialism in China. 
But what follows from this? 
From this it follows that the Left Kuomintang is performing 
approximately the same role in the present bourgeois-
democratic revolution in China as the Soviets performed 
in the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia 
in 1905. 
It would be a different matter if there was no popular 
and revolutionary-democratic organisation in China such 
as the Left Kuomintang. But since there is such a specific 
revolutionary organisation, one which is adapted to 
the specific features of Chinese conditions, and which 
has proved its suitability for the further development 
of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in China, it would 
be foolish and unwise to destroy this organisation, built 
up in the course of years, now when the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution has only just begun, is not yet victorious 
and will not so soon be victorious.

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 309 
From this consideration, certain comrades draw the 
conclusion that the Kuomintang may be utilised in the 
future as well, during the transition to the proletarian 
revolution, as the form of state organisation of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat; and they see in this the possibility 
of a peaceful transition from the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution to the proletarian revolution. 
Generally speaking, the possibility of a peaceful development 
of the revolution is not, of course, out of the question. 
With us in Russia, too, in the early part of 1917 
there was talk of the possibility of a peaceful development 
of the revolution through the Soviets. 
But, firstly, the Kuomintang is not the same thing as 
Soviets, and while it may be adapted for the work of developing 
the bourgeois-democratic revolution, that does 
not necessarily mean that it can be adapted for the work 
of developing the proletarian revolution; whereas Soviets 
of workers¹ deputies are the form best adapted for the 
dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Secondly, even with Soviets, a peaceful transition to 
the proletarian revolution in Russia in 1917 proved in 
fact to be out of the question. 
Thirdly, proletarian centres in China are so few, and 
the enemies of the Chinese revolution so strong and numerous, 
that every advance of the revolution and every 
assault of the imperialists will inevitably be accompanied 
by fresh secessions from the Kuomintang and a fresh 
strengthening of the Communist Party at the expense of 
the prestige of the Kuomintang. 
I think that a peaceful development of the Chinese 
revolution must be regarded as out of the question. 
I think that Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies

J. V. S T A L I N 310 
will have to be set up in China during the period of 
transition from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to 
the proletarian revolution. For under present-day conditions 
such a transition is impossible without Soviets of 
workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies. 
It is necessary first to enable the agrarian movement 
to develop throughout China, it is necessary to strengthen 
Wuhan and support it in the struggle against the feudalbureaucratic 
regime, it is necessary to help Wuhan to 
achieve victory over the counter-revolution, it is necessary 
broadly and universally to develop peasant associations, 
workers¹ trade unions and other revolutionary organisations 
as a basis for the setting up of Soviets in the future, 
it is necessary to enable the Chinese Communist Party 
to strengthen its influence among the peasantry and in 
the army‹and only after this may Soviets of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ deputies be set up as organs of struggle for 
a new power, as elements of a dual power, as elements in 
the preparation for the transition from the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution to the proletarian revolution. 
The setting up of workers¹ Soviets in China is not 
a matter of empty words, of empty ³revolutionary² declamations. 
This question cannot be regarded so lightmindedly 
as Trotsky does. 
The formation of workers¹ and peasants¹ Soviets 
means, first of all, withdrawing from the Kuomintang, because 
you cannot set up Soviets and promote a dual power, 
by calling upon the workers and peasants to establish a 
new power, and at the same time remain within the Kuomintang 
and its government. 
The setting up of Soviets of workers¹ deputies means, 
further, replacing the present bloc within the Kuomintang

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 311 
by a bloc outside the Kuomintang, a bloc similar to the 
one that the Bolsheviks had with the Left Socialist- 
Revolutionaries in October 1917. 
Why? 
Because, whereas in the case of a bourgeois-democratic 
revolution it is a matter of establishing a revolutionary 
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, and the 
policy of a bloc within the Kuomintang fully conforms 
to this, in the case of the formation of Soviets and the 
transition to the proletarian revolution it will be a matter 
of setting up the dictatorship of the proletariat, of 
setting up the power of the Soviets, and such a power 
can be prepared for and set up only under the leadership 
of one party, the Communist Party. 
Further, Soviets of workers¹ deputies entail obligations. 
The Chinese worker today earns 8-15 rubles a month, 
lives in intolerable conditions, and is heavily overworked. 
This state of affairs must be, and can be, ended immediately 
by raising wages, introducing an eight-hour day, improving 
the housing conditions of the working class, etc. 
But when there are Soviets of workers¹ deputies, the workers 
will not be content with that. They will say to the 
Communists (and they will be right): Since we have 
Soviets, and Soviets are organs of power, why not encroach 
somewhat on the bourgeoisie and expropriate them 
³just a little²? The Communists would be empty wind-bags 
if they did not adopt the course of expropriating the bourgeoisie, 
given the existence of Soviets of workers¹ and 
peasants¹ deputies. 
But, the question arises, can and should this course 
be adopted now, in the present phase of the revolution?

J. V. S T A L I N 312 
No, it should not. 
Can and should one refrain from expropriating the 
bourgeoisie in the future, when there are Soviets of 
workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies? No. But whoever thinks 
that when that is the case the Communists can retain the 
bloc within the Kuomintang is labouring under a delusion 
and does not understand the working of the struggle 
of class forces in the period of transition from the bourgeois 
revolution to the proletarian revolution. 
That is how matters stand with the question of setting 
up Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies in 
China. 
As you see, it is not so simple as certain excessively 
light-minded people, like Trotsky and Zinoviev, make out. 
In general, is it permissible in principle for Marxists 
to take part and co-operate with the revolutionary bourgeoisie 
in one common revolutionary-democratic party, 
or in one common revolutionary-democratic government? 
Some of the oppositionists think that it is not permissible. 
But the history of Marxism tells us that under certain 
conditions and for a certain period it is quite permissible. 
I might refer to such an example as that of Marx in 
Germany in 1848, at the time of the revolution against 
German absolutism, when Marx and his supporters joined 
the bourgeois-democratic league in the Rhineland, and 
when the organ of that revolutionary-democratic party, 
the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, was edited by him. 
While belonging to that bourgeois-democratic league 
and spurring on the revolutionary bourgeoisie, Marx and 
his supporters strenuously criticised the half-heartedness

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 313 
of their allies on the Right, just as the Communist Party 
in China, while belonging to the Kuomintang, must 
strenuously criticise the vacillation and half-heartedness 
of its Left Kuomintang allies. 
We know that only in the spring of 1849 did Marx 
and his supporters quit that bourgeois-democratic league 
and proceed to form an independent organisation of the 
working class, with an absolutely independent class 
policy. 
As you see, Marx went even further than the Chinese 
Communist Party, which belongs to the Kuomintang as 
the independent class party of the proletariat. 
One may argue or not as to whether it was expedient 
for Marx and his supporters to join that bourgeois-democratic 
league in 1848. Rosa Luxemburg, for instance, 
thought that Marx should not have joined it. That is a 
question of tactics. But that in principle Marx and 
Engels granted the possibility and expediency of joining 
a bourgeois-revolutionary party in a period of bourgeoisdemocratic 
revolution, under certain conditions and 
for a definite period, is not open to doubt. As to whether 
Marxists may, under definite conditions and in a definite 
situation, take part and co-operate in a revolutionary-democratic 
government together with the revolutionary bourgeoisie, 
on this point we have the opinion of such Marxists 
as Engels and Lenin. We know that Engels in his 
pamphlet The Bakuninists at Work, 66 pronounced in 
favour of such participation. We know that Lenin, in 
1905, likewise said that such participation in a bourgeois-
democratic revolutionary government was permissible.

J. V. S T A L I N 314

TWO LINES 
And so, we have before us two entirely different lines 
on the Chinese question‹the line of the Comintern and 
the line of Trotsky and Zinoviev. 
The line of the Comintern. Feudal survivals, and the 
bureaucratic-militarist superstructure which rests upon 
them and which receives every support from the imperialists 
of all countries, are the basic fact of Chinese life 
today. 
China at the present moment is passing through an 
agrarian revolution directed both against the feudal survivals 
and against imperialism. 
The agrarian revolution constitutes the basis and content 
of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in China. 
The Kuomintang in Wuhan and the Wuhan government 
are the centre of the bourgeois-democratic revolutionary 
movement. 
Nanking and the Nanking government are the centre 
of national counter-revolution. 
The policy of supporting Wuhan is at the same time 
a policy of developing the bourgeois-democratic revolution, 
with all the consequences resulting from that. Hence 
the participation of the Communists in the Wuhan Kuomintang 
and in the Wuhan revolutionary government, 
a participation which does not exclude, but rather presupposes 
strenuous criticism by the Communists of the 
half-heartedness and vacillation of their allies in the Kuomintang. 
The Communists must utilise this participation to 
facilitate the proletariat¹s role of hegemon in the Chinese

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 315 
bourgeois-democratic revolution, and to hasten the moment 
of transition to the proletarian revolution. 
When the moment of the complete victory of the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution approaches, and when in 
the course of the bourgeois revolution the paths of transition 
to the proletarian revolution become clear, the time 
will have arrived when it is necessary to set up Soviets 
of workers¹, peasants¹ and soldiers¹ deputies, as elements 
of a dual power, as organs of struggle for a new power, as 
organs of a new power, Soviet power. 
When that time comes the Communists must replace 
the bloc within the Kuomintang by a bloc outside the 
Kuomintang, and the Communist Party must become the 
sole leader of the new revolution in China. 
To propose now, as Trotsky and Zinoviev do, the immediate 
formation of Soviets of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies 
and the immediate establishment of dual power now, 
when the bourgeois-democratic revolution is still in the 
initial phase of its development, and when the Kuomintang 
represents the form of organisation of the nationaldemocratic 
revolution best adapted and most closely corresponding 
to the specific features of China, would be to 
disorganise the revolutionary movement, weaken Wuhan, 
facilitate its downfall, and render assistance to Chang Tsolin 
and Chiang Kai-shek. 
The line of Trotsky and Zinoviev. Feudal survivals 
in China are a figment of Bukharin¹s imagination. They 
either do not exist at all in China, or are so insignificant 
that they cannot have any serious importance. 
There does appear to be an agrarian revolution in 
China at this moment. But where it comes from, the devil 
only knows. (Laughter.)

J. V. S T A L I N 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


DISTRIBUTION 
316 
But since there is this agrarian revolution, it must, 
of course, be supported somehow. 
The chief thing just now is not the agrarian revolution, 
but a revolution for the customs independence of 
China, an anti-customs revolution, so to speak. 
The Wuhan Kuomintang and the Wuhan government 
are either a ³fiction² (Trotsky), or Kemalism (Zinoviev). 
On the one hand, dual power must be established 
for overthrowing the Wuhan government through the 
immediate formation of Soviets (Trotsky). On the other 
hand, the Wuhan government must be strengthened, it 
must be given energetic and all-round assistance, also, 
it appears, through the immediate formation of Soviets 
(Zinoviev). 
By rights, the Communists ought to withdraw immediately 
from this ³fiction²‹the Wuhan government and 
the Wuhan Kuomintang. However, it would be better if 
they remained in this ³fiction,² i.e., in the Wuhan government 
and the Wuhan Kuomintang. But why they 
should remain in Wuhan if Wuhan is a ³fiction²‹that, it 
seems, God alone knows. And whoever does not agree with 
this is a betrayer and traitor. 
Such is the so-called line of Trotsky and Zinoviev. 
Anything more grotesque and confused than this socalled 
line it would be hard to imagine. 
One gets the impression that one is dealing not with 
Marxists, but with some sort of bureaucrats who are completely 
divorced from real life‹or, still more, with ³revolutionary² 
tourists, who have been busy touring about 
Sukhum and Kislovodsk and such-like places, overlooked 
the Seventh Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee 
of the Comintern, which defined the basic at

REVOLUTION IN CHINA AND TASKS OF THE COMINTERN 317 
titude towards the Chinese revolution, and then, having 
learned from the newspapers that some sort of a revolution‹
whether agrarian or anti-customs, they were not quite 
clear‹was really taking place in China, they decided that 
it was necessary to compile a whole heap of theses‹ 
one set in April, another in the early part of May, a third 
in the latter part of May‹and having done so, they 
bombard the Executive Committee of the Comintern with 
them, apparently believing that a plethora of confused and 
contradictory theses is the best means of saving the 
Chinese revolution. 
Such, comrades, are the two lines on the questions of 
the Chinese revolution. 
You will have to choose between them. 
I am concluding, comrades. 
I should like, in closing, to say a few words on the 
political meaning and importance of Trotsky¹s and Zinoviev¹s 
factional pronouncements at this moment. They 
complain that they are not allowed sufficient freedom to 
indulge in unparalleled abuse and impermissible vilification 
of the C.C., C.P.S.U.(B.) and the E.C.C.I. They 
complain of a ³regime² within the Comintern and the 
C.P.S.U.(B.). Essentially, what they want is freedom to 
disorganise the Comintern and the C.P.S.U.(B.). Essentially, 
what they want is to transplant to the Cominternand 
the C.P.S.U.(B.) the manners of Maslow & Co. 
I must say, comrades, that Trotsky has chosen a very 
inappropriate moment for his attacks on the Party and the 
Comintern. I have just received information that the 
British Conservative government has decided to break 
off relations with the U.S.S.R. There is no need to prove 
that this will be followed by a universal campaign against

J. V. S T A L I N 318 
the Communists. This campaign has already begun. Some 
are threatening the C.P.S.U.(B.) with war and intervention. 
Others threaten it with a split. Something like a 
united front from Chamberlain to Trotsky is being formed. 
It is possible that they want to frighten us. But it 
scarcely needs proof that Bolsheviks are not the sort to 
be frightened. The history of Bolshevism knows plenty of 
such ³fronts.² The history of Bolshevism shows that 
such ³fronts² have invariably been smashed by the 
revolutionary determination and supreme courage of the 
Bolsheviks. 
You need have no doubt that we shall succeed in 
smashing this new ³front² too. (Applause.)

TO THE STUDENTS OF THE COMMUNIST 
UNIVERSITY OF THE TOILERS OF THE EAST 
Dear Comrades, 
Two years ago, when I addressed you on the occasion 
of the fourth anniversary of the Communist University 
of the Toilers of the East, I spoke of the tasks of the University 
both in relation to the Soviet Republics and in 
relation to the oppressed countries of the East.67 
The University, in performance of its tasks, is now 
sending into the fire of battle new cadres of fighters, 
its fourth set of graduates, representatives of 74 nationalities, 
comrades armed with the mighty weapon of 
Leninism. 
These comrades are starting out on their militant labours 
at one of the most crucial moments of history, when 
world imperialism, and British imperialism in the first 
place, is trying to seize the Chinese revolution by the throat 
and is at the same time casting a challenge to the first 
proletarian state in the world‹the Soviet Union‹in the 
hope of annihilating this mighty and unshakeable bulwark 
of the proletarians of all countries.

J. V. S T A L I N 320 
Greeting our comrades who have just graduated, I 
express my firm conviction that they will perform with honour 
their duty towards the proletariat and will devote all 
their energies and knowledge to the cause of emancipating 
the toiling people of the East from imperialist oppression.

REPLY TO S. POKROVSKY 
When I began this correspondence with you I thought 
I was dealing with a man who was seeking the truth. Now, 
after your second letter, I see that I am corresponding 
with a self-conceited, impudent person, who sets the ³interests² 
of his own ego higher than the interests of truth. 
Do not be surprised, then, if in this brief (and last) reply 
I shall speak bluntly and call a spade a spade. 
1. I affirmed that in the period following the February 
Revolution of 1917 the Party replaced the old strategic 
slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry 
and ³alliance with the whole peasantry² by the new strategic 
slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and poor 
peasantry and ³alliance with the poor peasantry.² 
I affirmed that the Party advanced towards and arrived 
at October putting this new slogan into effect, and 
that if it had not done so, the Party could not have 
welded together the necessary political army capable of 
overthrowing the power of the bourgeoisie and establishing 
the power of the proletariat. 
You have emphatically challenged this assertion of 
mine and have tried to prove that ³in the period from 
February to October the Party upheld its old slogan 
in relation to the peasantry‹alliance with the whole 
peasantry² (see your first letter). And you not only tried

J. V. S T A L I N 322 
to prove this anti-Leninist and purely Kamenevist conception, 
but regarded it almost as an axiom. 
Such was the case, and our dispute was precisely on 
this point. 
Now, seeing into what an impasse your stubbornness 
and self-assurance have led you, you are compelled to 
acknowledge under your breath that you were in error and 
declare that ³the Party¹s strategic slogan in the April- 
October period was indeed that of the dictatorship of 
the proletariat and poor peasantry² (see your second 
letter). 
But while acknowledging your error under your 
breath, you there and then endeavour out loud to reduce it 
to a trifling ³verbal² inaccuracy, by declaring that ³the 
verbal formulation in which I clothed my thought in my 
last letter when I said that the Party had discarded its 
old slogan of alliance with the whole peasantry was perhaps 
liable to lead to unclarity² (see your second 
letter). 
It follows that our dispute was over a ³verbal² formulation, 
and not over two conceptions differing in principle! 
That, to put it mildly, is what is called effrontery. 
2. I affirmed that the preparations for October proceeded 
in the midst of a struggle against the compromising 
policy and vacillations of a certain section of the 
peasantry in the Soviets, that these vacillations and 
this compromising policy were creating a supreme danger 
to the revolution (defeat of the Bolsheviks in July 
1917), that only with the slogan of the dictatorship of the 
proletariat and poor peasantry could a successful struggle 
be waged against these vacillations and compromising 
policy, and that only thanks to this slogan were the

REPLY TO S. POKROVSKY 323 
Bolsheviks able to neutralise the vacillations and compromising 
policy of the middle peasant. 
You emphatically contested this and persisted in your 
erroneous opinion that in the February-October period the 
Party carried on its work under the old slogan of ³alliance 
with the whole peasantry.² And, in contesting it, 
you thereby deleted from the history of Bolshevism 
some of its finest pages, which treat of the struggle 
waged by the Bolsheviks to sever the middle strata of 
the peasantry from the petty-bourgeois parties, to isolate 
those parties, and to neutralise the vacillations and compromising 
policy of certain strata of the peasantry. 
Such was the case. 
Now you are compelled to acknowledge both the fact 
of the vacillations and compromising policy of a certain 
section of the peasantry in the February-October period, 
and the fact that the Bolsheviks did wage a struggle 
against those vacillations and that compromising policy. 
But while acknowledging all this, you try to make out 
that it has no bearing on the question of neutralising the 
middle peasants, and even contrive to reproach me with 
³having given no reply² on the question of neutralising 
the middle peasants. 
One thing or the other: either you are excessively 
naive, or you deliberately put on a mask of naiveté 
for some purpose that is by no means scientific. 
3. I affirmed that the Party was victorious in October 
because it had successfully put into effect the new 
strategic slogan of dictatorship of the proletariat and poor 
peasantry; that if it had not replaced the old slogan of 
alliance with the peasantry as a whole by the new slogan 
of alliance with the poor peasantry it could not have

J. V. S T A L I N 324 
secured either victory in October, or the support of the 
peasantry as a whole in the course of the October 
Revolution; that the peasantry as a whole supported the 
Bolsheviks only in so far as the latter were carrying 
the bourgeois revolution to completion, and that, since 
the fundamental aim of October was not a bourgeois, but 
a socialist revolution, this support on the part of the peasantry 
as a whole was of a conditional and restricted 
character. 
You, in essence, contested this, since in your first 
letter you denied the fact that in the period following 
the February Revolution the old slogan was replaced 
by a new one. 
Such was the case. 
Now you are compelled to acknowledge in words that 
the old strategic slogan about the peasantry as a whole, 
really was replaced by the new strategic slogan about alliance 
with the poor peasantry. 
But having acknowledged this truth, you there and 
then proceeded, in the Kamenev manner, to cover up your 
tracks by counterposing the ³tactical² task of securing 
the support of the peasantry as a whole to the ³strategic² 
task of securing an alliance with the poor peasantry; in 
the Kamenev manner you discredited the truth you had 
just acknowledged about the second strategic slogan and, 
in essence, reverted to the old Kamenev position, contriving 
at the same time falsely to accuse me of not recognising 
the alleged fact of a certain conditional support rendered 
to the Bolsheviks in October by the peasantry 
as a whole. 
You evidently do not understand that tactical tasks 
are part of the strategic task, that the former cannot be

REPLY TO S. POKROVSKY 325 
identified with the latter, and still less can the one be 
counterposed to the other. 
You evidently do not understand that the support 
which the peasantry as a whole rendered the proletarian 
revolution could be only very conditional and restricted, to 
the extent that the October Revolution was completing 
the bourgeois revolution, that is, to the extent that it was 
abolishing landlord proprietorship, landlordism and the 
political superstructure of landlordism‹the monarchy. 
You evidently do not know that in October 1917, after 
the seizure of power by the Soviets, the Petrograd garrison 
(peasants) refused to go to the front against Kerensky when 
he was advancing on Petrograd, declaring that they, the 
garrison, were ³for peace and against a new war,² and apparently 
understanding peace to mean, not the transformation 
of the imperialist war into a civil war, but sticking 
their bayonets into the ground, that is, they understood it 
in the way that you and many other political philistines 
have understood it (see your first letter). 
You evidently do not know that Petrograd was at that 
time saved from the onslaught of Kerensky and Krasnov 
by the Red Guards and the sailors. 
You evidently do not know that we waged the Civil 
War in its first phase‹in the period from October 1917 
to the spring of 1918‹chiefly by the efforts of the workers 
and sailors, and that the so-called support of the ³peasantry 
as a whole² was at that time expressed for the most 
part in the fact that they did not directly prevent us from 
striking at the enemies of the proletarian revolution. 
You evidently do not know that in fact we succeeded 
in creating the Red Army, as a mass army, only in the latter 
half of 1918, when the land had already been shared

J. V. S T A L I N 326 
out by the peasants, when the kulak was already sufficiently 
weakened, when the Soviet power had already succeeded 
in holding its own, and when the possibility arose 
of putting into effect the slogan of ³a stable alliance 
with the middle peasant.² . . . 
Of course, it is possible to write all kinds of nonsense 
and fiction‹paper will tolerate everything; it is possible, 
in the Kamenev manner, to twist and dodge and cover 
up one¹s tracks. . . . But, after all, there is a limit. 
4. Carried away by the ³artistry² of your pen, and 
having conveniently forgotten your first letter, you assert 
that I have misunderstood the question of the growing over 
of the bourgeois revolution into the socialist revolution. 
That is indeed laying one¹s own fault at another¹s 
door! 
What is the growing over of the bourgeois revolution 
into the socialist revolution? Is it conceivable in our country 
without replacing the old slogan of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and peasantry by a new slogan about the 
dictatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry? Obviously 
not. 
Why was it that Lenin fought Kamenev in April 1917, 
advocating the replacement of the old slogan by a new 
one and linking this replacement with the transition from 
the first stage of the Russian revolution (a bourgeois-democratic 
revolution) to its second stage (a proletarian revolution)? 
Was it not in order to make possible and to 
facilitate the growing over of the bourgeois revolution into 
the socialist revolution? Obviously, it was. 
Who was it that objected at that time to going over 
from the old slogan to the new? Obviously, it was Kamenev.

REPLY TO S. POKROVSKY 327 
Who was it that in the spring of 1927 denied the fact 
that the Bolsheviks had replaced the old strategic slogan 
by a new strategic slogan in the period of preparation 
for October? Obviously, i t was you, my dear 
Pokrovsky. 
Who was it that corrected this Kamenevist error of 
Pokrovsky¹s? Obviously, it was Comrade Stalin. 
Is it not clear from this that you have not understood 
in the slightest, absolutely not in the slightest, the question 
of the growing over of the bourgeois revolution into 
the proletarian revolution? 
Conclusion: one must possess the effrontery of an 
ignoramus and the self-complacency of a narrow-minded 
equilibrist to turn things upside-down so discourteously 
as you do, my dear Pokrovsky. 
I think the time has come to stop corresponding with 
you.

THE THREAT OF WAR 
It can scarcely be doubted that the main issue of the 
present day is that of the threat of a new imperialist war. 
It is not a matter of some vague and immaterial ³danger² 
of a new war but of the real and actual threat of a new war 
in general, and of a war against the U.S.S.R. in particular. 
The redivision of the world and of spheres of influence 
that took place as a result of the last imperialist war 
has already managed to become ³obsolete.² Certain new 
countries (America, Japan) have come to the fore. Certain 
old countries (Britain) are receding into the background. 
Capitalist Germany, all but buried at Versailles, 
is reviving and growing and becoming steadily stronger. 
Bourgeois Italy, with an envious eye on France, is 
creeping upwards. 
A frantic struggle is in progress for markets, for fields 
of capital export, for the sea and land routes to those 
markets, for a new redivision of the world. The contradictions 
between America and Britain, between Japan and 
America, between Britain and France, between Italy and 
France, are growing. 
The contradictions within the capitalist countries are 
growing, every now and again breaking out in the form

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 329 
of open revolutionary actions of the proletariat (Britain, 
Austria). 
The contradictions between the imperialist world 
and the dependent countries are growing, now and again 
breaking out in the form of open conflicts and revolutionary 
explosions (China, Indonesia, North Africa, 
South America). 
But the growth of all these contradictions signifies 
a growth of the crisis of world capitalism, despite the 
fact of stabilisation, a crisis incomparably deeper than 
the one before the last imperialist war. The existence 
and progress of the U.S.S.R., the land of proletarian 
dictatorship, only deepens and aggravates this crisis. 
No wonder that imperialism is preparing for a new 
war, in which it sees the only way out of the crisis. The 
unparalleled growth of armaments, the general tendency 
of the bourgeois governments towards fascist methods of 
³administration,² the crusade against the Communists, 
the frenzied campaign of slander against the U.S.S.R., 
the outright intervention in China‹all these are different 
aspects of one and the same phenomenon: the preparation 
for a new war for a new redivision of the world. 
The imperialists would long ago have come to blows 
among themselves, were it not for the Communist Parties, 
which are waging a determined struggle against imperialist 
war, were it not for the U.S.S.R., whose peaceful policy 
is a heavy fetter on the instigators of a new war, 
and were it not for their fear of weakening one another 
and thus facilitating a new breach of the imperialist 
front. 
I think that this last circumstance‹that is, the 
imperialists¹ fear of weakening one another and thus

J. V. S T A L I N 330 
facilitating a new breach of the imperialist front‹is one 
of the chief factors which have so far restrained the urge 
for a mutual slaughter. 
Hence the ³natural² endeavour of certain imperialist 
circles to relegate the contradictions in their own camp 
to the background, to gloss them over temporarily, to 
create a united front of the imperialists and to make war 
on the U.S.S.R., in order to solve the deepening crisis 
of capitalism even if only partially, even if only temporarily, 
at the expense of the U.S.S.R. 
The fact that the initiative in this matter of creating 
a united front of the imperialists against the U.S.S.R. 
has been assumed by the British bourgeoisie and its general 
staff, the Conservative Party, should not come as 
a surprise to us. British capitalism has always been, is, 
and will be the most malignant strangler of peoples¹ revolutions. 
Beginning with the great bourgeois revolution 
in France at the close of the eighteenth century and down 
to the revolution now taking place in China, the British 
bourgeoisie has always been in the front ranks of 
the suppressors of the movement for the emancipation 
of mankind. The Soviet people will never forget the violence, 
robbery and armed invasion to which our country 
was subjected some years ago thanks to the British capitalists. 
What, then, is there surprising in the fact that 
British capitalism and its Conservative Party are again 
undertaking to lead a war against the centre of the world 
proletarian revolution, the U.S.S.R.? 
But the British bourgeoisie is not fond of doing its 
own fighting. It has always preferred to make war through 
the hands of others. And it has indeed succeeded at 
times in finding fools willing to serve as cat¹s-paws for it.

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 331 
Such was the case at the time of the great bourgeois 
evolution in France, when the British bourgeoisie succeeded 
in forming an alliance of European states against 
revolutionary France. 
Such was the case after the October Revolution in 
the U.S.S.R., when the British bourgeoisie, having attacked 
the U.S.S.R., tried to form an ³alliance of fourteen 
states,² and when, in spite of this, they were hurled 
out of the U.S.S.R. 
Such is the case now in China, where the British 
bourgeoisie is trying to form a united front against 
the Chinese revolution. 
It is quite comprehensible that, in preparing for war 
against the U.S.S.R., the Conservative Party has for 
several years now been carrying out preparatory work 
for the formation of a ³holy alliance² of large and small 
states against the U.S.S.R. 
Whereas earlier, until recently, the Conservatives 
carried out this preparatory work more or less covertly, 
now, however, they have passed to ³direct action,² 
striking open blows at the U.S.S.R. and trying to build 
their notorious ³holy alliance² in sight of all. 
The British Conservative government struck its first 
open blow in Peking, by the raid on the Soviet Embassy. 
This raid had at least two aims. It was intended to discover 
³terrible² documentary evidence of ³subversive² 
activity on the part of the U.S.S.R. which would create 
an atmosphere of general indignation and provide the 
basis for a united front against the U.S.S.R. It was intended 
also to provoke an armed conflict with the 
Peking government and embroil the U.S.S.R. into a 
war with China.

J. V. S T A L I N 332 
This blow, as we know, failed. 
The second open blow was struck in London, by the 
raid on ARCOS and the severance of relations with the 
U.S.S.R. Its aim was to create a united front against 
the U.S.S.R., to inaugurate a diplomatic blockade of 
the U.S.S.R. throughout Europe and to provoke a series 
of ruptures of treaty relations with the Soviet Union. 
This blow, as we know, also failed. 
The third open blow was struck in Warsaw, by the 
instigation of the assassination of Voikov. Voikov¹s 
assassination, organised by agents of the Conservative 
Party, was intended by its authors to play a role similar 
to that of the Sarajevo assassination by embroiling the 
U.S.S.R. in an armed conflict with Poland. 
This blow also seems to have failed. 
How is it to be explained that these blows have so 
far not produced the results which the Conservatives expected 
from them? 
By the conflicting interests of the various bourgeois 
states, many of whom are interested in maintaining economic 
relations with the U.S.S.R. 
By the peaceful policy of the U.S.S.R., which the 
Soviet Government pursues firmly and unwaveringly. 
By the reluctance of the states dependent on Britain‹
whether it be the state of Chang Tso-lin or the 
state of Pilsudski‹to serve as dumb tools of the Conservatives 
to the detriment of their own interests. 
The noble lords apparently refuse to understand 
that every state, even the smallest, i s inclined to 
regard itself as an entity, tries to live its own independent 
life, and is unwilling to hazard its existence for 
the sake of the bright eyes of the Conservatives. The Brit

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 333 
ish Conservatives have omitted to take all these circumstances 
into account. 
Does this mean that there will be no more blows of 
this kind? No, it does not. On the contrary, it only 
means that the blows will be renewed with fresh strength. 
These blows must not be regarded as a matter of chance. 
They are naturally prompted by the entire international 
situation, by the position of the British bourgeoisie 
both in the ³metropolitan country² and in the colonies, 
by the Conservative Party¹s position as the ruling 
party. 
The entire international situation today, all the facts 
regarding the ³operations² of the British Government 
against the U.S.S.R.‹the fact that it is organising a 
financial blockade of the U.S.S.R., the fact that it is 
secretly conferring with the powers on a policy hostile to 
the U.S.S.R., the fact that it is subsidising the émigré 
³governments² of the Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, 
Armenia, etc., with a view to instigating revolts in these 
countries of the U.S.S.R., the fact that it is financing 
bands of spies and terrorists, who blow up bridges, set 
fire to factories and commit acts of terrorism against 
U.S.S.R. ambassadors‹all this unmistakably goes to 
show that the British Conservative government has firmly 
and determinedly adopted the course of organising war 
against the U.S.S.R. And it must be considered by no 
means out of the question that, under certain circumstances, 
the Conservatives may succeed in getting together 
some military bloc or other against the U.S.S.R. 
What are our tasks? 
It is our task to sound the alarm in all the countries 
of Europe over the threat of a new war, to rouse the

J. V. S T A L I N 334 
vigilance of the workers and soldiers of the capitalist 
countries, and to work, to work indefatigably, to prepare 
the masses to counter with the full strength of revolutionary 
struggle every attempt of the bourgeois governments 
to organise a new war. 
It is our task to pillory all those leaders of the labour 
movement who ³consider² the threat of a new war to 
be a ³figment of the imagination,² who lull the workers 
with pacifist lies, who close their eyes to the fact that 
the bourgeoisie is preparing for a new war‹for these people 
want the war to catch the workers by surprise. 
The task is for the Soviet Government firmly and unwaveringly 
to continue its policy of peace, the policy 
of peaceful relations, notwithstanding the provocative 
acts of our enemies, notwithstanding pin-pricks to our 
prestige. 
Provocative elements in the enemy camp taunt us, 
and will continue to taunt us, with the assertion that our 
peaceful policy is due to our weakness, to the weakness 
of our army. Some of our comrades are at times enraged 
by this, are inclined to succumb to the provocation and 
to urge the adoption of ³vigorous² measures. That is a 
sign of weak nerves, of lack of stamina. We cannot, and 
must not, dance to the tune of our enemies. We must go 
our own way, upholding the cause of peace, demonstrating 
our desire for peace, exposing the predatory designs 
of our enemies and showing them up as instigators 
of war. 
For only such a policy can enable us to weld the 
masses of the working people of the U.S.S.R. into a single 
fighting camp if, or rather when, the enemy forces war 
upon us.

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 335 
As regards our ³weakness,² or the ³weakness² of 
our army, this is not the first time that our enemies 
have made such a mistake. Some eight years ago, too, 
when the British bourgeoisie resorted to intervention 
against the U.S.S.R. and Churchill threatened a campaign 
of ³fourteen states,² the bourgeois press shouted about 
the ³weakness² of our army. But all the world knows 
that both the British interventionists and their allies 
were ignominiously thrown out of our country by our 
victorious army. 
Messieurs the instigators of a new war would do 
well to remember this. 
The task is to increase the defensive capacity of our 
country, to expand our national economy, to improve 
our industry‹both war and non-war‹to enhance the 
vigilance of the workers, peasants and Red Army men of 
our country, steeling them in the determination to defend 
the socialist motherland and putting an end to the slackness 
which, unfortunately, is as yet far from having been 
eliminated. 
The task is to strengthen our rear and cleanse it of 
dross, not hesitating to mete out punishment to ³illustrious² 
terrorists and incendiaries who set fire to our 
mills and factories, because it is impossible to defend 
our country in the absence of a strong revolutionary rear. 
Recently a protest was received from the well-known 
leaders of the British labour movement, Lansbury, Maxton 
and Brockway, against the shooting of the twenty Russian 
princes and nobles who were guilty of terrorism and 
arson. I cannot regard those leaders of the British labour 
movement as enemies of the U.S.S.R. But they are worse 
than enemies.

J. V. S T A L I N 336 
They are worse than enemies because, although they 
call themselves friends of the U.S.S.R., by their protest 
they nevertheless make it easier for Russian landlords and 
British secret agents to go on organising the assassination 
of representatives of the U.S.S.R. 
They are worse than enemies because by their protest 
they tend to bring about a state of affairs in which 
the workers of the U.S.S.R. are left unarmed in face of 
their sworn enemies. 
They are worse than enemies because they refuse to 
realise that the shooting of the twenty ³illustrious² ones 
was a necessary measure of self-defence on the part of 
the revolution. 
It is rightly said: ³God save us from such friends; 
our enemies we can cope with ourselves.² 
As to the shooting of the twenty ³illustrious² ones, 
let the enemies of the U.S.S.R., both internal and 
external enemies, know that the proletarian dictatorship 
in the U.S.S.R. is alive and that its hand is 
firm. 
What, after all this, should be said of our luckless 
opposition in connection with its latest attacks on our 
Party in face of the threat of a new war? What should 
be said of the fact that it, this opposition, has found the 
war threat an appropriate occasion to intensify its attacks 
on the Party? What is there creditable in the fact that, 
instead of rallying around the Party in face of the threat 
from without, it considers it appropriate to make use 
of the U.S.S.R.¹s difficulties for new attacks on the Party? 
Can it be that the opposition is against the victory of the 
U.S.S.R. in the coming battles with imperialism, against 
increasing the defensive capacity of the Soviet Union,

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 337 
against strengthening our rear? Or, perhaps, it is cowardice 
in the face of the new difficulties, desertion, a desire 
to evade responsibility, masked by a blast of Leftist 
phrases?. . . 
II 
CHINA 
Now that the revolution in China has entered a new 
phase of development, we can to some extent sum up the 
path already travelled and proceed to verify the line 
of the Comintern in China. 
There are certain tactical principles of Leninism, 
without due regard for which there can be neither 
correct leadership of the revolution, nor verification 
of the Comintern¹s line in China. These principles 
have been forgotten by our oppositionists long ago. 
But just because the opposition suffers from forgetfulness, 
it has to be reminded of them again and 
again. 
I have in mind such tactical principles of Leninism 
as: 
a) the principle that the nationally peculiar and nationally 
specific features in each separate country must 
unfailingly be taken into account by the Comintern when 
drawing up guiding directives for the working-class 
movement of the country concerned; 
b) the principle that the Communist Party of each 
country must unfailingly avail itself of even the smallest 
opportunity of gaining a mass ally for the proletariat, 
even i f a temporary, vacillating, unstable and unreliable 
ally;

J. V. S T A L I N 338 
c) the principle that unfailing regard must be paid 
to the truth that propaganda and agitation alone are not 
enough for the political education of the vast masses, 
that what is required for that is the political experience 
of the masses themselves. 
I think that due regard for these tactical principles 
of Leninism is an essential condition, without which 
a Marxist verification of the Comintern¹s line in the 
Chinese revolution is impossible. 
Let us examine the questions of the Chinese revolution 
in the light of these tactical principles. 
Notwithstanding the ideological progress of our 
Party, there are still, unfortunately, ³leaders² of a sort 
in it who sincerely believe that the revolution in China 
can be directed, so to speak, by telegraph, on the basis 
of the universally recognised general principles of the 
Comintern, disregarding the national peculiarities of 
China¹s economy, political system, culture, manners and 
customs, and traditions. What, in fact, distinguishes 
these ³leaders² from real leaders is that they always 
have in their pockets two or three ready-made formulas, 
³suitable² for all countries and ³obligatory² under all 
conditions. The necessity of taking into account the 
nationally peculiar and nationally specific features of each 
country does not exist for them. Nor does the necessity 
exist for them of co-ordinating the general principles 
of the Comintern with the national peculiarities of the 
revolutionary movement in each country, the necessity 
of adapting these general principles to the national 
peculiarities of the state in each country. 
They do not understand that the chief task of leadership 
now that the Communist Parties have grown

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 339 
and become mass parties, is to discover, to grasp, the 
nationally peculiar features of the movement in each 
country and skilfully co-ordinate them with the Comintern¹s 
general principles, in order to facilitate and make 
feasible the basic aims of the Communist movement. 
Hence the attempts to stereotype the leadership for 
all countries. Hence the attempts mechanically to implant 
certain general formulas, regardless of the concrete 
conditions of the movement in different countries. Hence 
the endless conflicts between the formulas and the revolutionary 
movement in the different countries, as 
the main outcome of the leadership of these pseudoleaders. 
It is precisely to this category of pseudo-leaders 
that our oppositionists belong. 
The opposition has heard that a bourgeois revolution 
is taking place in China. It knows, furthermore, 
that the bourgeois revolution in Russia took place in 
opposition to the bourgeoisie. Hence the ready-made 
formula for China: down with all joint action with the 
bourgeoisie, long live the immediate withdrawal of 
the Communists from the Kuomintang (April 1926). 
But the opposition has forgotten that, unlike the 
Russia of 1905, China is a semi-colonial country oppressed 
by imperialism; that, in consequence of this, the 
revolution in China is not simply a bourgeois revolution, 
but a bourgeois revolution of an anti-imperialist 
type; that, in China, imperialism controls the principal 
threads of industry, trade and transport; that imperialist 
oppression affects not only the Chinese labouring 
masses, but also certain sections of the Chinese 
bourgeoisie; and that, in consequence, the Chinese

J. V. S T A L I N 340 
bourgeoisie may, under certain conditions and for a 
certain period, support the Chinese revolution. 
And that, as we know, is in fact what occurred. 
If we take the Canton period of the Chinese revolution, 
the period when the national armies had reached the 
Yangtse, the period prior to the split in the Kuomintang, 
it has to be admitted that the Chinese bourgeoisie supported 
the revolution in China, that the Comintern¹s line 
that joint action with this bourgeoisie is permissible for 
a certain period and under certain conditions proved to 
be absolutely correct. 
The result is the retreat of the opposition from its 
old formula and its proclamation of a ³new² formula, 
namely, joint action with the Chinese bourgeoisie is 
essential, the Communists must not withdraw from the 
Kuomintang (April 1927). 
That was the first punishment that befell the opposition 
for refusing to take into account the national 
peculiarities of the Chinese revolution. 
The opposition has heard that the Peking government 
is squabbling with the representatives of the imperialist 
states over the question of customs autonomy 
for China. The opposition knows that it is primarily 
the Chinese capitalists that need customs autonomy. 
Hence the ready-made formula: the Chinese revolution 
i s a national, anti-imperialist revolution, because 
its chief aim is to win customs autonomy for 
China. 
But the opposition has forgotten that the strength 
of imperialism in China does not lie mainly in the customs 
restrictions in China, but in the fact that it owns 
mills, factories, mines, railways, steamships, banks and

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 341 
trading firms in that country, which suck the blood of 
the millions of Chinese workers and peasants. 
The opposition has forgotten that the revolutionary 
struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism is due 
first and foremost to the fact that imperialism in China 
is the force that supports and inspires the immediate 
exploiters of the Chinese people‹the feudal lords, 
militarists, capitalists, bureaucrats, etc.‹and that the 
Chinese workers and peasants cannot defeat their exploiters 
without at the same time waging a revolutionary 
struggle against imperialism. 
The opposition forgets that it is precisely this circumstance 
that is one of the major factors making possible 
the growing over of the bourgeois revolution in 
China into a socialist revolution. 
The opposition forgets that anyone who declares 
that the Chinese anti-imperialist revolution is a revolution 
for customs autonomy denies the possibility of 
the growing over of the bourgeois revolution in China 
into a socialist revolution, for he places the revolution 
under the leadership of the Chinese bourgeoisie. 
And, indeed, the facts have since shown that 
customs autonomy is in essence the platform of the 
Chinese bourgeoisie, because even such inveterate 
reactionaries as Chang Tso-lin and Chiang Kai-shek 
now declare in favour of the abolition of the unequal 
treaties and the establishment of customs autonomy 
in China. 
Hence the opposition¹s divided stand, its attempts 
to wriggle out of its own formula about customs autonomy, 
its surreptitious attempts to renounce this formula 
and to hitch on to the Comintern¹s stand that the

J. V. S T A L I N 342 
growing over of the bourgeois revolution in China into 
a socialist revolution is possible. 
That was the second punishment that befell the opposition 
for refusing to make a serious study of the 
national peculiarities of the Chinese revolution. 
The opposition has heard that the merchant bourgeoisie 
has penetrated the Chinese countryside, leasing 
land to poor peasants. The opposition knows that the 
merchant is not a feudal lord. Hence the ready-made 
formula: feudal survivals, hence also the struggle of the 
peasantry against feudal survivals, are of no serious 
importance in the Chinese revolution, and that the 
chief thing in China today is not the agrarian revolution, 
but the question of China¹s state-customs dependence on 
the imperialist countries. 
The opposition, however, fails to see that the specific 
feature of China¹s economy is not the penetration 
of merchant capital into the countryside, but a combination 
of the domination of feudal survivals with the 
existence of merchant capital in the Chinese countryside, 
along with the preservation of medieval 
feudal methods of exploiting and oppressing the 
peasantry. 
The opposition fails to understand that the entire 
military-bureaucratic machine which today so inhumanly 
robs and oppresses the Chinese peasantry is essentially 
a political superstructure on this combination of 
the domination of feudal survivals and feudal methods 
of exploitation with the existence of merchant capital 
in the countryside. 
And, indeed, the facts have since shown that a 
gigantic agrarian revolution has developed in China,

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 343 
directed first and foremost against the Chinese feudal 
lords, big and small. 
The facts have shown that this revolution embraces 
tens of millions of peasants and is tending to spread 
over the whole of China. 
The facts have shown that feudal lords‹real feudal 
lords of flesh and blood‹not only exist in China, but 
wield power in a number of provinces, dictate their will 
to the military commanders, subordinate the Kuomintang 
leadership to their influence, and strike blow after 
blow at the Chinese revolution. 
To deny, after this, the existence of feudal survivals 
and a feudal system of exploitation as the main form 
of oppression in the Chinese countryside, to refuse to 
recognise that the agrarian revolution is the main factor 
in the Chinese revolutionary movement at the 
present time, would be flying in the face of obvious 
facts. 
Hence the opposition¹s retreat from its old formula 
regarding feudal survivals and the agrarian revolution. 
Hence the opposition¹s attempt to slink away from its 
old formula and tacitly to recognise the correctness of 
the Comintern¹s position. 
That is the third punishment which has befallen the 
opposition for its unwillingness to take into account the 
national peculiarities of China¹s economy. 
And so on and so forth. 
Disharmony between formulas and reality‹such is 
the lot of the oppositionist pseudo-leaders. 
And this disharmony is a direct result of the opposition¹s 
repudiation of the well-known tactical principle 
of Leninism that the nationally peculiar and nationally

J. V. S T A L I N 344 
specific features in the revolutionary movement of each 
separate country must unfailingly be taken into account. 
Here is how Lenin formulates this principle: 
³The whole point now is that the Communists of every country 
should quite consciously take into account both the main 
fundamental tasks of the struggle against opportunism and ŒLeft¹ 
doctrinairism and the specific features which this struggle assumes 
and inevitably must assume in each separate country in conformity 
with the peculiar features of its economics, politics, culture, 
national composition (Ireland, etc.), its colonies, religious divisions, 
and so on and so forth. Everywhere it is felt that dissatisfaction 
with the Second International is spreading and growing, 
both because of its opportunism and because of its inability, or 
incapacity, to create a really centralised, really leading, centre 
capable of directing the international tactics of the revolutionary 
proletariat in its struggle for a world Soviet republic. We must 
clearly realise that such a leading centre cannot under any circumstances 
be built up on stereotyped, mechanically equalised and 
identical tactical rules of struggle.* As long as national and state 
differences exist among peoples and countries‹and these differences 
will continue to exist for a very long time even after the 
dictatorship of the proletariat has been established on a world 
scale‹the unity of international tactics of the communist working-
class movement of all countries demands, not the elimination 
of variety, not the abolition of national differences (that is a foolish 
dream at the present moment), but such an application of 
the fundamental principles of communism (Soviet power and 
the dictatorship of the proletariat) as would correctly modify these 
principles in certain particulars, correctly adapt and apply them 
to national and national-state differences. Investigate, study, 
seek, divine, grasp that which is nationally peculiar, nationally 
specific in the concrete manner in which each country approaches 
the fulfilment of the single international task, in which it approaches 
the victory over opportunism and Left doctrinairism within 
the working class movement, the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, and 
* My italics.‹J. St.

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 345 
the establishment of a Soviet republic and a proletarian dictatorship*‹
such is the main task of the historical period through which 
all the advanced countries (and not only the advanced countries) 
are now passing² (see ³Left-Wing² Communism, an Infantile 
Disorder, Vol. XXV, pp. 227-28). 
The line of the Comintern is the line of unfailingly 
taking this tactical principle of Leninism into 
account. 
The line of the opposition, on the contrary, is the 
line of repudiating this tactical principle. 
In that repudiation lies the root of the opposition¹s 
misadventures in the questions of the character and 
prospects of the Chinese revolution. 
* 
* 
* 
Let us pass to the second tactical principle of 
Leninism. 
Out of the character and prospects of the Chinese 
revolution there arises the question of the allies of the 
proletariat in its struggle for the victory of the revolution. 
The question of the allies of the proletariat is one 
of the main questions of the Chinese revolution. The 
Chinese proletariat is confronted by powerful enemies: 
the big and small feudal lords, the military-bureaucratic 
machine of the old and the new militarists, the counterrevolutionary 
national bourgeoisie, and the Eastern 
and Western imperialists, who have seized control of 
the principal threads of China¹s economic life and who 
reinforce their right to exploit the Chinese people by 
their troops and fleets. 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 346
To smash these powerful enemies requires, apart 
from everything else, a flexible and well-considered 
policy on the part of the proletariat, the ability to take 
advantage of every rift in the camp of its enemies, and 
the ability to find allies, even if they are vacillating 
and unstable allies, provided that they are mass allies, 
that they do not restrict the revolutionary propaganda 
and agitation of the party of the proletariat, and do not 
restrict the party¹s work of organising the working class 
and the labouring masses. 
This policy is a fundamental requirement of the 
second tactical principle of Leninism. Without such a 
policy, the victory of the proletariat is impossible. 
The opposition regards such a policy as incorrect, 
un-Leninist. But that only indicates that it has shed the 
last remnants of Leninism, that it is as far from Leninism 
as heaven is from earth. 
Did the Chinese proletariat have such allies in the 
recent past? 
Yes, it did. 
In the period of the first stage of the revolution, 
when it was a revolution of an all-national united front 
(the Canton period), the proletariat¹s allies were 
the peasantry, the urban poor, the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, 
and the national bourgeoisie. 
One of the specific features of the Chinese revolutionary 
movement is that the representatives of those 
classes worked jointly with the Communists within a 
single, bourgeois-revolutionary organisation, called the 
Kuomintang. 
Those allies were not, and could not be, all equally 
reliable. Some of them were more or less reliable allies

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 347 
(the peasantry, the urban poor), others were less reliable 
and vacillating (the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia), others 
again were entirely unreliable (the national bourgeoisie). 
At that time the Kuomintang was unquestionably 
more or less a mass organisation. The policy of the Communists 
within the Kuomintang consisted in isolating 
the representatives of the national bourgeoisie (the Rights) 
and utilising them in the interests of the revolution, 
in impelling the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia (the 
Lefts) leftwards, and in rallying the peasantry and the 
urban poor around the proletariat. 
Was Canton at that time the centre of the Chinese 
revolutionary movement? It certainly was. Only lunatics 
can deny that now. 
What were the achievements of the Communists 
during that period? Extension of the territory of the revolution, 
inasmuch as the Canton armies reached the 
Yangtse; the possibility of openly organising the proletariat 
(trade unions, strike committees); the formation 
of the communist organisations into a party; the 
creation of the first nuclei of peasant organisations (the 
peasant associations); communist penetration into the 
army. 
It follows that the Comintern¹s leadership during 
that period was quite correct. 
In the period of the second stage of the revolution, 
when Chiang Kai-shek and the national bourgeoisie 
deserted to the camp of counter-revolution, and the 
centre of the revolutionary movement shifted from 
Canton to Wuhan, the proletariat¹s allies were the 
peasantry, the urban poor, and the petty-bourgeois 
intelligentsia.

J. V. S T A L I N 348 
How is the desertion of the national bourgeoisie to 
the camp of counter-revolution to be explained? By 
fear of the scope assumed by the revolutionary movement 
of the workers, in the first place, and, secondly, by 
the pressure exerted on the national bourgeoisie by the 
imperialists in Shanghai. 
Thus the revolution lost the national bourgeoisie. 
That was a partial loss for the revolution. But, on the 
other hand, it entered a higher phase of its development, 
the phase of agrarian revolution, by bringing the broad 
masses of the peasantry closer to itself. That was a gain 
for the revolution. 
Was the Kuomintang at that time, in the period of 
the second stage of the revolution, a mass organisation? 
It certainly was. It was unquestionably more of a mass 
organisation than was the Kuomintang of the Canton 
period. 
Was Wuhan at that time the centre of the revolutionary 
movement? It certainly was. Surely only the 
blind could deny that now. Otherwise Wuhan¹s territory 
(Hupeh, Hunan) would not have been the base for 
the maximum development of the agrarian revolution, 
which was led by the Communist Party. 
The policy of the Communists towards the Kuomintang 
at that time was to impel it leftwards and to transform 
it into the core of a revolutionary-democratic 
dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry. 
Was such a transformation possible at that time? 
It was. At any rate, there was no reason to believe such 
a possibility out of the question. We plainly said at the 
time that to transform the Wuhan Kuomintang into the 
core of a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 349 
proletariat and peasantry at least two conditions 
were required: a radical democratisation of the Kuomintang, 
and direct assistance by the Kuomintang to the 
agrarian revolution. It would have been foolish for 
the Communists to have refrained from attempting such 
a transformation. 
What were the achievements of the Communists 
during that period? 
The Communist Party during that period grew from 
a small party of 5-6 thousand members into a large 
mass party of 50-60 thousand members. 
The workers¹ trade unions grew into a huge national 
federation with about three million members. 
The primary peasant organisations expanded into 
huge associations embracing several tens of millions 
of members. The agrarian movement of the peasantry 
grew to gigantic proportions and came to occupy the 
central place in the Chinese revolutionary movement. 
The Communist Party gained the possibility of openly 
organising the revolution. The Communist Party became 
the leader of the agrarian revolution. The hegemony 
of the proletariat began to change from a wish into a 
reality. 
It is true that the Chinese Communist Party failed 
to exploit all the possibilities of that period. It is true 
that during that period the Central Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party committed a number of grave 
errors. But it would be ridiculous to think that the 
Chinese Communist Party can become a real Bolshevik 
party at one stroke, so to speak, on the basis of the Comintern¹s 
directives. One has only to recall the history 
of our Party, which passed through a series of splits,

J. V. S T A L I N 350 
secessions, betrayals, treacheries and so forth, to realise 
that real Bolshevik parties do not come into being at 
one stroke. 
It follows, then, that the Comintern¹s leadership 
during that period, too, was quite correct. 
Does the Chinese proletariat have allies today? 
It does. 
These allies are the peasantry and the urban poor. 
The present period is marked by the desertion of the 
Wuhan leadership of the Kuomintang to the camp of 
counter-revolution, by the desertion of the petty-bourgeois 
intelligentsia from the revolution. 
This desertion is due, firstly, to the fear of the pettybourgeois 
intelligentsia in face of the spread of the agrarian 
revolution and to the pressure of the feudal lords 
on the Wuhan leadership, and, secondly, to the pressure 
of the imperialists in the Tientsin area, who are demanding 
that the Kuomintang break with the Communists 
as the price for permitting its passage northward. 
The opposition has doubts about the existence of 
feudal survivals in China. But it is now clear to all that 
not only do feudal survivals exist in China, but that 
they have proved to be even stronger than the onslaught 
of the revolution at the present time. And it is because 
the imperialists and the feudal lords in China 
have for the time being proved to be stronger that the 
revolution has sustained a temporary defeat. 
On this occasion the revolution has lost the pettybourgeois 
intelligentsia. 
That indeed is a sign that the revolution has sustained 
a temporary defeat. 
But, on the other hand, i t has rallied the broad

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 351 
masses of the peasantry and urban poor more closely 
around the proletariat, and has thereby created the basis 
for the hegemony of the proletariat. 
That is a gain for the revolution. 
The opposition ascribes the temporary defeat of the 
revolution to the Comintern¹s policy. But only people 
who have broken with Marxism can say that. Only people 
who have broken with Marxism can demand that a 
correct policy should always and necessarily lead to 
immediate victory over the enemy. 
Was the policy of the Bolsheviks in the 1905 Revolution 
a correct one? Yes, it was. Why, then, did the 1905 
Revolution suffer defeat, despite the existence of 
Soviets, despite the correct policy of the Bolsheviks? 
Because the feudal survivals and the autocracy proved 
at that time to be stronger than the revolutionary 
movement of the workers. 
Was the policy of the Bolsheviks in July 1917 a correct 
one? Yes, it was. Why, then, did the Bolsheviks sustain 
defeat, again despite the existence of Soviets, which at 
that time betrayed the Bolsheviks, and despite the correct 
policy of the Bolsheviks? Because Russian imperialism 
proved at that time to be stronger than the revolutionary 
movement of the workers. 
A correct policy is by no means bound to lead always 
and without fail to direct victory over the enemy. 
Direct victory over the enemy is not determined by 
correct policy alone; it is determined first and foremost 
by the correlation of class forces, by a marked preponderance 
of strength on the side of the revolution, by disintegration 
in the enemy¹s camp, by a favourable international 
situation.

J. V. S T A L I N 352 
Only given those conditions can a correct policy of 
the proletariat lead to direct victory. 
But there is one obligatory requirement which a correct 
policy must satisfy always and under all conditions. 
That requirement is that the Party¹s policy must enhance 
the fighting capacity of the proletariat, multiply its 
ties with the labouring masses, increase its prestige among 
these masses, and convert the proletariat into the hegemon 
of the revolution. 
Can it be affirmed that this past period has presented 
the maximum favourable conditions for the direct 
victory of the revolution in China? Clearly, it cannot. 
Can it be affirmed that communist policy in China 
has not enhanced the fighting capacity of the proletariat, 
has not multiplied its ties with the broad masses, and has 
not increased its prestige among these masses? Clearly, 
it cannot. 
Only the blind could fail to see that the Chinese proletariat 
has succeeded in this period in severing the 
broad mass of the peasantry both from the national 
bourgeoisie and from the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, 
so as to rally them around its own standard. 
The Communist Party went through a bloc with the 
national bourgeoisie in Canton at the first stage of the 
revolution in order to extend the area of the revolution, 
to form itself into a mass party, to secure the possibility 
of openly organising the proletariat, and to open up a 
road for itself to the peasantry. 
The Communist Party went through a bloc with 
the Kuomintang petty-bourgeois intelligentsia in Wuhan 
at the second stage of the revolution in order to multiply 
i t s forces, to extend the organisation of the

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 353 
proletariat, to sever the broad masses of the peasantry 
from the Kuomintang leadership, and to create the 
conditions for the hegemony of the proletariat. 
The national bourgeoisie has gone over to the camp 
of counter-revolution, having lost contact with the 
broad masses of the people. 
The Kuomintang petty-bourgeois intelligentsia in 
Wuhan has trailed in the wake of the national bourgeoisie, 
having taken fright at the agrarian revolution and 
having utterly discredited itself in the eyes of the 
peasant millions. 
On the other hand, however, the vast masses of the 
peasantry have rallied more closely around the proletariat, 
seeing in it their only reliable leader and guide. 
Is it not clear that only a correct policy could have 
led to such results? 
Is it not clear that only such a policy could have enhanced 
the fighting capacity of the proletariat? 
Who but the pseudo-leaders belonging to our opposition 
can deny the correctness and revolutionary character 
of such a policy? 
The opposition asserts that the swing of the Wuhan 
Kuomintang leadership to the side of the counterrevolution 
indicates that the policy of a bloc with the- 
Wuhan Kuomintang at the second stage of the revolution 
was incorrect. 
But only people who have forgotten the history of 
Bolshevism and who have shed the last remnants of 
Leninism can say that. 
Was the Bolshevik policy of a revolutionary bloc 
with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in October and 
after October, down to the spring of 1918, a correct one?

J. V. S T A L I N 354 
I believe that nobody has yet ventured to deny that this 
bloc was correct. How did this bloc end? With a revolt 
of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries against the Soviet 
government. Can it be affirmed on these grounds that the 
policy of a bloc with the Socialist-Revolutionaries was 
incorrect? Obviously, it cannot. 
Was the policy of a revolutionary bloc with the Wuhan 
Kuomintang at the second stage of the Chinese revolution 
a correct one? I believe that nobody has yet ventured 
to deny that this bloc was correct during the second 
stage of the revolution. The opposition itself declared 
at that time (April 1927) that such a bloc was correct. 
How, then, can it be asserted now, after the Wuhan 
Kuomintang leadership has deserted the revolution, and 
because of this desertion, that the revolutionary bloc 
with the Wuhan Kuomintang was incorrect? 
Is it not clear that only spineless people can employ 
such ³arguments²? 
Did anyone assert that the bloc with the Wuhan Kuomintang 
would be eternal and unending? Do such things 
as eternal and unending blocs exist at all? Is it not clear 
that the opposition has no understanding, no understanding 
whatever, of the second tactical principle of Leninism, 
concerning a revolutionary bloc of the proletariat 
with non-proletarian classes and groups? 
Here is how Lenin formulates this tactical principle: 
³The more powerful enemy can be vanquished only by exerting 
the utmost effort, and by making, without fail, the most 
thorough, careful, attentive and skilful use both of every, even 
the smallest, Œrift¹ among the enemies, every antagonism of interests 
among the bourgeoisie of the various countries and among 
the various groups or types of bourgeoisie within individual coun

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 355 
tries, as well as of every, even the smallest, opportunity of gaining 
mass ally, even though a temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable 
and conditional ally. He who has not understood this, has 
not understood even a particle of Marxism, or of scientific, modern 
socialism in general.* He who has not proved by deeds over a 
fairly considerable period of time, and in fairly varied political 
situations, his ability to apply this truth in practice has not yet 
learned to assist the revolutionary class in its struggle to emancipate 
all toiling humanity from the exploiters. And this applies 
equally to the period before and after the proletariat has conquered 
political power² (see ³Left-Wing² Communism, an Infantile 
Disorder, Vol. XXV, pp. 210-11). 
Is it not clear that the line of the opposition is the 
line of repudiating this tactical principle of Leninism? 
Is it not clear that the line of the Comintern, on 
the contrary, is the line of unfailingly taking this tactical 
principle into account? 
* * 
* 
Let us pass to the third tactical principle of Leninism. 
This tactical principle concerns the question of change 
of slogans, the order and methods of such change. It 
concerns the question how to convert a slogan for the party 
into a slogan for the masses, how and in what way to 
bring the masses to the revolutionary positions, so that 
they may convince themselves by their own political 
experience of the correctness of the Party¹s slogans. 
And the masses cannot be convinced by propaganda 
and agitation alone. What is required for that is the 
political experience of the masses themselves. What is 
required for that is that the broad masses shall come to

feel, from painful experience, the inevitability, say, of 
overthrowing a given system, the inevitability of 
establishing a new political and social order. 
It was a good thing that the advanced group, the 
Party, had already convinced itself of the inevitability 
of the overthrow, say, of the Milyukov-Kerensky Provisional 
Government in April 1917. But that was not yet 
enough for coming forward and advocating the overthrow 
of that government, for putting forward the 
slogan of the overthrow of the Provisional Government and 
the establishment of Soviet power as a slogan of the day. 
In order to convert the formula ³All Power to the Soviets² 
from a perspective for the immediate future into a 
slogan of the day, into a slogan of immediate action, one 
other decisive factor was required, namely, that the 
masses themselves should become convinced of the correctness 
of this slogan, and should help the Party in one 
way or another to put it into effect. 
A strict distinction must be drawn between a formula 
as a perspective for the immediate future and a 
formula as a slogan of the day. It was precisely on 
this point that the group of Petrograd Bolsheviks headed 
by Bagdatyev came to grief in April 1917, when they 
prematurely put forward the slogan ³Down with the Provisional 
Government, All Power to the Soviets.² Lenin 
at the time qualified that attempt of the Bagdatyev group 
as dangerous adventurism and publicly denounced it.68 
Why? 
Because the broad masses of the working people in 
the rear and at the front were not yet ready to accept 
that slogan. Because that group confused the formula 
³All Power to the Soviets,² as a perspective, with the

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 357 
slogan ³All Power to the Soviets,² as a slogan of the day. 
Because that group was running too far ahead, exposing 
the Party to the threat of being completely isolated 
from the broad masses, from the Soviets, which at 
that time still believed that the Provisional Government 
was revolutionary. 
Should the Chinese Communists have put forward 
the slogan ³Down with the Kuomintang leadership 
in Wuhan² six months ago, say? No, they should not. 
They should not, because that would have been dangerously 
running too far ahead, it would have made it 
difficult for the Communists to gain access to the broad 
masses of the working people, who still believed in the 
Kuomintang leadership; it would have isolated the Communist 
Party from the broad masses of the peasantry. 
They should not, because the Wuhan Kuomintang 
leadership, the Wuhan Central Committee of the Kuomintang, 
had not yet exhausted its potentialities as a 
bourgeois-revolutionary government, had not yet disgraced 
and discredited itself in the eyes of the broad 
masses of the working people by its fight against the agrarian 
revolution, by its fight against the working class, 
and by its swing over to the counter-revolution. 
We always said that it would be wrong to adopt the 
course of discrediting and replacing the Wuhan Kuomintang 
leadership so long as it had not yet exhausted its 
potentialities as a bourgeois-revolutionary government; 
that it should first be allowed to do so before raising in 
practice the question of replacing it. 
Should the Chinese Communists now put forward 
the slogan ³Down with the Kuomintang leadership in 
Wuhan²? Yes, they certainly should.

J. V. S T A L I N 358 
Now that the Kuomintang leadership has disgraced 
itself by its struggle against the revolution and has 
taken up an attitude of hostility towards the broad 
masses of the workers and peasants, this slogan will meet 
with a powerful response among the masses of the people. 
Every worker and every peasant will now understand 
that the Communists acted rightly in withdrawing from 
the Wuhan government and the Wuhan Central Committee 
of the Kuomintang, and in putting forward the 
slogan ³Down with the Kuomintang leadership in 
Wuhan.² 
For the masses of the peasants and workers are now 
faced with the choice: either the present Kuomintang 
leadership‹which means refusing to satisfy the vital needs 
of these masses, repudiating the agrarian revolution; or 
agrarian revolution and a radical improvement of the 
position of the working class‹which means that replacing 
the Kuomintang leadership in Wuhan becomes 
a slogan of the day for the masses. 
Such are the demands of the third tactical principle 
of Leninism, concerning the question of change of slogans, 
the question of the ways and means of bringing the 
broad masses to the new revolutionary positions, the question 
how, by the policy and actions of the Party and the 
timely replacement of one slogan by another, to help the 
broad masses of the working people to recognise the 
correctness of the Party¹s line on the basis of their own 
experience. 
Here is how Lenin formulates this tactical principle: 
³Victory cannot be won with the vanguard alone. To throw 
the vanguard alone into the decisive battle, before the whole class, 
before the broad masses have taken up a position either of direct

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 359 
support of the vanguard, or at least of benevolent neutrality towards 
i t , and one in which they cannot possibly support the 
enemy, would be not merely folly but a crime. And in order that 
actually the whole class, that actually the broad masses of the working 
people and those oppressed by capital may take up such a position, 
propaganda and agitation alone are not enough. For this the 
masses must have their own political experience.* Such is the fundamental 
law of all great revolutions, now confirmed with astonishing 
force and vividness not only in Russia but also in Germany. Not 
only the uncultured, often illiterate, masses of Russia, but the 
highly cultured, entirely literate masses of Germany had to realise 
through their own painful experience the absolute impotence and 
spinelessness, the absolute helplessness and servility to the bourgeoisie, 
the utter vileness, of the government of the knights of 
the Second International, the absolute inevitability of a dictatorship 
of the extreme reactionaries (Kornilov in Russia, Kapp and 
Co. in Germany) as the only alternative to a dictatorship of the 
proletariat, in order to turn resolutely towards communism. 
The immediate task that confronts the class-conscious vanguard 
of the international labour movement, i.e., the Communist Parties, 
groups and trends, is to be able to lead the broad masses 
(as yet, for the most part, slumbering, apathetic, bound by routine, 
inert and dormant) to their new position, or, rather, to be 
able to lead not only their own party, but also these masses, in their 
approach, their transition to the new position² (see ³Left-Wing² 
Communism, an Infantile Disorder, Vol. XXV, p. 228). 
The basic error of the opposition is that it does not 
understand the meaning and importance of this tactical 
principle of Leninism, that it does not recognise it and 
systematically violates it. 
It (Trotskyists) violated this tactical principle at the 
beginning of 1917, when it attempted to ³skip over² the 
agrarian movement which had not yet been completed 
(see Lenin). 
* My italics.‹J. St.

J. V. S T A L I N 360 
It (Trotsky-Zinoviev) violated this principle when 
it at tempted to ³skip over² the reactionary character of 
the trade unions, failing to recognise the expediency 
of Communists working in reactionary trade unions, 
and denying the necessity for temporary blocs with 
them. 
It (Trotsky-Zinoviev-Radek) violated this principle 
when it attempted to ³skip over² the national peculiarities 
of the Chinese revolutionary movement (the Kuomintang), 
the backwardness of the masses of the Chinese 
people, by demanding, in April 1926, the immediate 
withdrawal of the Communists from the Kuomintang, 
and, in April 1927, by putting forward the slogan of immediate 
organisation of Soviets, at a time when the Kuomintang 
phase of development had not yet been completed 
and had not yet outlived its day. 
The opposition thinks that if it has understood, has 
recognised, the half-heartedness, vacillation and unreliability 
of the Kuomintang leadership, if it has recognised 
the temporary and conditional character of the bloc with 
the Kuomintang (and that is not difficult for any competent 
political worker to recognise), that is quite sufficient 
to warrant starting ³determined action² against the Kuomintang, 
against the Kuomintang government, quite sufficient 
to induce the masses, the broad masses of the workers 
and peasants ³at once² to support ³us² and ³our² 
³determined action.² 
The opposition forgets that ³our² understanding all 
this is still very far from enough to enable the Chinese 
Communists to get the masses to follow them. The opposition 
forgets that what this also requires is that the masses 
themselves should recognise from their own experience

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 361 
the unreliable, reactionary and counter-revolutionary 
character of the Kuomintang leadership. 
The opposition forgets that it is not only the advanced 
group, not only the Party, not only individual, 
even if ³exalted,² ³personalities,² but first and foremost 
the vast masses of the people, that ³make² a revolution. 
It is strange that the opposition should forget about 
the state of the vast masses of the people, about their 
level of understanding, about their readiness for determined 
action. 
Did we, the Party, Lenin, know in April 1917 that 
the Milyukov-Kerensky Provisional Government would 
have to be overthrown, that the existence of the Provisional 
Government was incompatible with the activity 
of the Soviets, and that the power would have to pass 
into the hands of the Soviets? Yes, we did. 
Why, then, did Lenin brand as adventurers the 
group of Petrograd Bolsheviks headed by Bagdatyev in 
April 1917, when that group put forward the slogan 
³Down with the Provisional Government, All Power to 
the Soviets,² and attempted to overthrow the Provisional 
Government? 
Because the broad masses of the working people, a 
certain section of the workers, millions of the peasantry, 
the broad mass of the army and, lastly, the Soviets themselves, 
were not yet prepared to accept that slogan as a 
slogan of the day. 
Because the Provisional Government and the Socialist-
Revolutionary and Menshevik petty-bourgeois parties 
had not yet exhausted their potentialities, had not 
yet sufficiently discredited themselves in the eyes of the 
vast masses of the working people.

J. V. S T A L I N 362 
Because Lenin knew that the understanding, the political 
consciousness, of the advanced group of the proletariat, 
the Party of the proletariat, was not enough by 
itself for the overthrow of the Provisional Government 
and the establishment of Soviet power‹that this required 
also that the masses themselves should become convinced 
of the correctness of this line through their own 
experience. 
Because it was necessary to go through the whole 
coalition orgy, through the betrayals and treacheries of 
the petty-bourgeois parties in June, July and August 
1917; it was necessary to go through the shameful offensive 
at the front in June 1917, through the ³honest² 
coalition of the petty-bourgeois parties with the Kornilovs 
and Milyukovs, through the Kornilov revolt and so 
on, in order that the vast masses of the working people 
should become convinced that the overthrow of the 
Provisional Government and the establishment of Soviet 
power were unavoidable. 
Because only under those circumstances could the 
slogan of Soviet power be transformed from a slogan that 
was a perspective into a slogan of the day. 
The trouble with the opposition is that it continually 
commits the same error as the Bagdatyev group 
committed in their day, that it abandons Lenin¹s 
road and prefers to ³march² along the road of 
Bagdatyev. 
Did we, the Party, Lenin, know that the Constituent 
Assembly was incompatible with the system of Soviet 
power when we took part in the elections to the 
Constituent Assembly and when we convened i t in 
Petrograd? Yes, we did.

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 363 
Why, then, did we convene it? How could it happen 
that the Bolsheviks, who were enemies of bourgeois parliamentarism 
and who established Soviet power, not only 
took part in the elections but even themselves convened 
the Constituent Assembly? Was this not ³khvostism,² 
lagging behind events, ³holding the masses in check,² 
violating ³long-range² tactics? Of course not. 
The Bolsheviks took this step in order to make it 
easier for the backward masses of the people to convince 
themselves with their own eyes that the Constituent 
Assembly was unsuitable, reactionary and counter-revolutionary. 
Only in that way was it possible to draw to our 
side the vast masses of the peasantry and make it easier 
for us to disperse the Constituent Assembly. 
Here is what Lenin writes about it: 
³We took part in the elections to the Russian bourgeois parliament, 
the Constituent Assembly, in September-November 1917. 
Were our tactics correct or not? . . . Did not we, the Russian Bolsheviks, 
have more right in September-November 1917 than any 
Western Communists to consider that parliamentarism was politically 
obsolete in Russia? Of course we did, for the point is not 
whether bourgeois parliaments have existed for a long time or a 
short time, but how far the broad masses of the working people 
are prepared (ideologically, politically and practically) to accept 
the Soviet system and to disperse the bourgeois-democratic parliament 
(or allow it to be dispersed). That in Russia in September- 
November 1917, owing to a number of special conditions, the 
urban working class and the soldiers and peasants were exceptionally 
well prepared to accept the Soviet system and to disperse 
the most democratic of bourgeois parliaments, is an absolutely 
incontestable and fully established historical fact. Nevertheless, 
the Bolsheviks did not boycott the Constituent Assembly, but 
took part in the elections both before the proletariat conquered 
political power and after. . . .

J. V. S T A L I N 364 
³The conclusion which follows from this is absolutely incontrovertible: 
it has been proved that participation in a bourgeois-democratic 
parliament even a few weeks before the victory of a 
Soviet republic, and even after such a victory, not only does not 
harm the revolutionary proletariat, but actually helps it to prove 
to the backward masses why such parliaments deserve to be dispersed; 
it helps their successful dispersal, and helps to make bour 
eois parliamentarism Œpolitically obsolete¹² (see ³Left-Wing² 
Communism, an Infantile Disorder, Vo l . XXV, pp. 201-02). 
That is how the Bolsheviks applied the third tactical 
principle of Leninism in practice. 
That is how Bolshevik tactics must be applied in 
China, whether in relation to the agrarian revolution, 
or to the Kuomintang, or to the slogan of Soviets. 
The opposition is apparently inclined to think that 
the revolution in China has suffered a complete fiasco. 
That, of course, is wrong. That the revolution in China 
has sustained a temporary defeat, of that there can be 
no doubt. But what sort of defeat, and how profound it 
is‹that is the question now. 
It is possible that it will be approximately as prolonged 
a defeat as was the case in Russia in 1905, when 
the revolution was interrupted for a full twelve years, 
only to break out later, in February 1917, with fresh 
force, sweep away the autocracy, and clear the way for 
a new, Soviet revolution. 
That prospect cannot be considered excluded. It is 
still not a complete defeat of the revolution, just as the 
defeat of 1905 could not be considered a final defeat. It 
is not a complete defeat, since the basic tasks of the 
Chinese revolution at the present stage of its development‹
agrarian revolution, revolutionary unification of 
China, emancipation from the imperialist yoke‹still

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


await their accomplishment. And if this prospect should 
become a reality, then, of course, there can be no question 
of the immediate formation of Soviets of workers¹ 
and peasants¹ deputies in China, because Soviets are 
formed and flourish only in circumstances of revolutionary 
upsurge. 
But that prospect can scarcely be considered a likely 
one. At all events, there are no grounds so far for considering 
it likely. There are none, because the counterrevolution 
is not yet united, and will not be soon, if indeed 
it is ever destined to be united. 
For the war of the old and the new militarists among 
themselves is flaring up with fresh force and cannot 
but weaken the counter-revolution, at the same time as 
it ruins and infuriates the peasantry. 
For there is still no group or government in China 
capable of undertaking something in the nature of a 
Stolypin reform which might serve the ruling groups as 
a lightning conductor. 
For the millions of the peasantry, who have already 
begun to lay hands on the landlords¹ land, cannot be so 
easily curbed and crushed to the ground. 
For the prestige of the proletariat in the eyes of the 
labouring masses in growing from day to day, and its 
forces are still very far from having been demolished. 
It is possible that the defeat of the Chinese revolution 
is analogous in degree to that suffered by the Bolsheviks 
in July 1917, when the Menshevik and Socialist- 
Revolutionary Soviets betrayed them, when they were 
forced to go underground, and when, a few months 
later, the revolution again came out into the streets in 
order to sweep away the imperialist government of Russia. 
NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES

J. V. S T A L I N 366 
The analogy, of course, is a qualified one. I make 
it with all the necessary reservations, bearing in mind 
the difference between the situation of China in our day 
and that of Russia in 1917. I resort to such an analogy 
only in order to indicate the approximate degree of defeat 
of the Chinese revolution. 
I think that this prospect is the more likely one. 
And if it should become a reality, if in the near future‹ 
not necessarily in a couple of months, but in six months 
or a year from now‹a new upsurge of the revolution 
should become a fact, the question of forming Soviets 
of workers¹ and peasants¹ deputies may become a live 
issue, as a slogan of the day, and as a counterpoise to the 
bourgeois government. 
Why? 
Because, if there is a new upsurge of the revolution in 
its present phase of development, the formation of Soviets 
will be an issue that has become fully mature. 
Recently, a few months ago, it would have been wrong 
for the Chinese Communists to issue the slogan of forming 
Soviets, for that would have been adventurism, which is 
characteristic of our opposition, for the Kuomintang leadership 
had not yet discredited itself as an enemy of the 
revolution. 
Now, on the contrary, the slogan of forming Soviets 
may become a really revolutionary slogan, if (if!) a new 
and powerful revolutionary upsurge takes place in the 
near future. 
Consequently, alongside the fight to replace the present 
Kuomintang leadership by a revolutionary leadership, 
it is necessary at once, even before the upsurge 
begins, to conduct the widest propaganda for the idea

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 367 
of Soviets among the broad masses of the working people, 
without running too far ahead and forming Soviets 
immediately, remembering that Soviets can flourish 
only at a time of powerful revolutionary upsurge. 
The opposition may say that i t said this ³first,² 
that this is precisely what it calls ³long-range² tactics. 
You are wrong, my dear sirs, absolutely wrong! That 
is not ³long-range² tactics; it is haphazard tactics, the 
tactics of perpetually overshooting and undershooting 
the mark. 
When, in April 1926, the opposition demanded that 
the Communists should immediately withdraw from the 
Kuomintang, that was overshooting tactics, because the 
opposition itself was subsequently compelled to admit 
that the Communists ought to remain in the Kuomintang. 
When the opposition declared that the Chinese revolution 
was a revolution for customs autonomy, that was 
undershooting tactics, because the opposition itself was 
subsequently compelled to slink away from its own formula. 
When, in April 1927, the opposition declared that 
to talk of feudal survivals in China was an exaggeration, 
forgetting the existence of the mass agrarian movement, 
that was undershooting tactics, because the opposition 
itself was subsequently compelled tacitly to admit its 
error. 
When, in April 1927, the opposition issued the slogan 
of immediate formation of Soviets, that was overshooting 
tactics, because the oppositionists themselves were compelled 
at the time to admit the contradictions in their 
own camp, one of them (Trotsky) demanding adoption 
of the course of overthrowing the Wuhan government,

J. V. S T A L I N 368 
and another (Zinoviev), on the contrary, demanding 
the ³utmost assistance² for this same Wuhan government. 
But since when have haphazard tactics, the tactics 
of perpetually overshooting and undershooting the mark, 
been called ³long-range² tactics? 
As to Soviets, it should be said that, long before 
the opposition, the Comintern in its documents spoke 
of Soviets in China as a perspective. As to Soviets as a 
slogan of the day‹put forward by the opposition in the 
spring of this year as a counterblast to the revolutionary 
Kuomintang (the Kuomintang was then revolutionary, 
otherwise there was no point in Zinoviev clamouring 
for the ³utmost assistance² for the Kuomintang)‹ 
that was adventurism, vociferous running too far ahead, 
the same adventurism and the same running too far 
ahead that Bagdatyev was guilty of in April 1917. 
From the fact that the slogan of Soviets may become 
a slogan of the day in China in the near future, it does 
not by any means follow that it was not dangerous and 
harmful adventurism on the part of the opposition 
to put forward the slogan of Soviets in the spring of 
this year. 
Just as it by no means follows from the fact that 
Lenin recognised the slogan ³All Power to the Soviets² 
to be necessary and timely in September 1917 (the Central 
Committee¹s decision on the uprising),69 that it was not 
harmful and dangerous adventurism on the part of Bagdatyev 
to put forward this slogan in April 1917. 
Bagdatyev, in September 1917, might also have said 
that he had been the ³first² to call for Soviet power, 
having done so in April 1917. Does this mean that Bag

NOTES ON CONTEMPORARY THEMES 369 
datyev was right, and that Lenin was wrong in qualifying 
his action in April 1917 as adventurism? 
Apparently, our opposition is envious of Bagdatyev¹s 
³laurels.² 
The opposition does not understand that the point 
is not at all to be ³first² in saying a thing, running too 
far ahead and disorganising the cause of the revolution, 
but to say it at the right time, and to say it in such a 
way that it will be taken up by the masses and put into 
practice. 
Such are the facts. 
The opposition has departed from Leninist tactics, 
its policy is one of ³ultra-Left² adventurism‹such is 
the conclusion.

1 The Seventh Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee 
of the Comintern was held in Moscow from November 22 to 
December 16, 1926. It discussed reports: on the international situation 
and the tasks of the Communist International; on China 
and Britain; on trustification, rationalisation and the tasks of 
Communists in the trade unions; on inner-Party questions of 
the C.P.S.U.(B.); on Germany and Holland. It also examined 
the cases of Maslow-Ruth Fischer, of Brandler and Thalheimer, 
and of Souvarine. A political, a Chinese, a British, a German 
and other commissions were set up at the plenum. J. V. Stalin 
was elected to the political, Chinese and German commissions. 
After discussing J. V. Stalin¹s report on ³Inner-Party Questions 
of the C.P.S.U.(B.),² the plenum branded the Trotsky-Zinoviev 
opposition bloc in the C.P.S.U.(B.) as a bloc of splitters who, 
in their platform, had sunk to the Menshevist position. The 
plenum made it obligatory for the sections of the Comintern to 
conduct a determined struggle against all attempts of the opposition 
in the C.P.S.U.(B.) and their followers in other Communist 
Parties to disrupt the ideological and organisational unity of the 
Comintern and of Lenin¹s party, the leader of the first proletarian 
state in the world. The plenum endorsed the resolution 
of the Fifteenth Conference of the C.P.S.U.(B.) on ³The Opposition 
Bloc in the C.P.S.U.(B.),² and resolved to append 
it to the plenum¹s resolutions as its own decision. J. V. Stalin¹s 
report on ³Inner-Party Questions of the C.P.S.U.(B.)² and 
his reply to the discussion were published in December 1926 as 
a separate pamphlet entitled Once More on the Social-Democratic 
Deviation in Our Party. p. 1

of the Party in the Soviets, opposed one-man management

for factions and groups in the Party. The Ninth and 
Tenth Party Congresses vigorously condemned the ³Democratic

20 Smena-Vekhite‹a supporter of the bourgeois political trend 
which arose in 1921 among the Russian bourgeois émigrés, and 
which received i t s name from the magazine Smena Vekh 
(Change of Landmarks). The trend reflected the views of the 
new bourgeoisie and bourgeois intelligentsia in Soviet Russia, 
who, owing to the introduction of the New Economic Policy, 
renounced open armed struggle against the Soviet government 
and counted on the Soviet system gradually degenerating 
into an ordinary bourgeois republic. Ustryalov was an ideologist 
of Smena-Vekhism. p. 73 
21 Nechayevism‹conspiratorial and terrorist tactics; from the 
name of a Russian Bakuninist anarchist, S. G. Nechayev. 
Towards the end of the sixties of the nineteenth century, he 
formed a narrow conspiratorial organisation which was isolated 
from the masses, and whose members were allowed no opportunity 
to express their will or opinion. p. 83

43 The international economic conference in Genoa (Italy) was 
held from April 10 to May 19, 1922. There took part in it, on 
the one hand, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan and other 
capitalist states, and, on the other hand, Soviet Russia. The representatives 
of the capitalist countries presented to the Soviet delegation 
demands which, if conceded, would have meant transforming 
the Soviet country into a colony of West-European 
capital (the demand for payment of all war and pre-war debts, 
for restitution to foreigners of nationalised property formerly 
owned by them, etc.). The Soviet delegation rejected the claims 
of the foreign capitalists. For the Genoa Conference, see

45 On March 23, 1927, in the course of successful battles against 
the Northern militarists for the unification of China, units 
of the national revolutionary army occupied Nanking. In an 
effort to crush the revolution, the imperialist powers passed 
from assisting the Chinese militarists to outright intervention 
in China, and on March 24 British and American warships 
bombarded Nanking. p. 196

47 The Kuomintang‹the political party in China formed by 
Sun Yat-sen in 1912 to fight for the establishment of a republic 
and the national independence of the country. The entry of 
the Chinese Communist Party into the Kuomintang (1924) 
helped to convert the latter into a people¹s revolutionary mass 
party. In the first stage of development of the Chinese revolution, 
1925-27, when it was an anti-imperialist revolution of a united 
all-national front, the Kuomintang was the party of a bloc of the 
proletariat, the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie and part of 
the big national bourgeoisie. In the second stage, in the 
period of the agrarian bourgeois-democratic revolution, after 
the national bourgeoisie had deserted to the camp of counterrevolution, 
the Kuomintang represented a bloc of the proletariat, 
the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and 
pursued an anti-imperialist revolutionary policy. The development 
of the agrarian revolution and the pressure of the feudal 
lords on the Kuomintang, on the one hand, and the pressure 
of the imperialists, who demanded that the Kuomintang 
break with the Communists, on the other hand, frightened 
the petty-bourgeois intellectuals (the Lefts in the Kuomintang), 
who swung over to the counter-revolution. When the Kuomintang 
Lefts began to desert the revolution (summer of 1927), 
the Communists withdrew from the Kuomintang, and the 
latter became a centre of struggle against the revolution.

and, in connection with Great Britain¹s severance of diplomatic 
and trade relations with the U.S.S.R., adopted an appeal 
³To the Workers and Peasants of the World. To All Oppressed 
Peoples. To the Soldiers and Sailors.² The leaders of the anti- 
Party Trotsky-Zinoviev bloc took advantage of the sharpened 
international position of the U.S.S.R. to launch slanderous 
attacks at the plenum on the leadership of the Comintern and 
the C.P.S.U.(B.). In a special resolution, the plenum sharply

gave an emphatic rebuff to the capitulator Kamenev, who 
demanded that the documents should be destroyed. J. V. Stalin 
proposed that the letters be circulated to the largest Party organisations 
for consideration. On October 10, 1917, the historic 
meeting of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party took
