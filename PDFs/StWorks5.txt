SPEECH 
AT THE OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE 
OF COMMUNISTS OF THE TYURK PEOPLES 
OF THE R.S.F.S.R.1 
January 1, 1921 
(Record in the Minutes) 
After declaring the conference open and mentioning the unsatisfactory 
character of the work of the Central Bureau which 
was to be elected anew, Comrade Stalin went on to describe 
briefly the conditions of the development of communism among the 
Tyurk peoples in the R.S.F.S.R. 
The development of communism in Russia has a long 
history, covering several decades, of theoretical work 
and theoretical struggle within the Russian socialist 
movement. As a result of that struggle a compact group 
of leading elements was formed, possessing sufficient 
theoretical knowledge and firmness of principle to lead 
the Party membership. 
In the eastern part of our country, however, communism 
arose only recently, in the course of the practical 
revolutionary struggle for socialism, without the preliminary 
theoretical stage of development. Hence, the 
weakness of Tyurk communism in the field of theory, 
a weakness that can be eliminated only by the creation 
of a literature, based on the principles of communism, 
in the Tyurk languages spoken in our country. 
In the history of the development of Russian communism, 
the struggle against the nationalist deviation

J. V. S T A L I N 2
never played an important part. Having been in the past 
the ruling nation, the Russians, including the Russian 
Communists, did not suffer national oppression, did 
not, generally speaking, have to deal with nationalist 
tendencies in their midst, except for certain moods 
in the direction of ³dominant-nation chauvinism,² and 
therefore did not have to overcome, or hardly had to 
overcome, such tendencies. 
The Tyurk Communists, on the other hand, sons of 
oppressed peoples who have gone through the stage of 
national oppression, always had to deal and still have 
to deal with the nationalist deviation, with nationalist 
survivals in their midst, and the immediate task of the 
Tyurk Communists is to overcome these survivals. This 
circumstance undoubtedly serves to retard the crystallisation 
of communism in the eastern part of our country. 
But communism in the East also enjoys an advantage. 
In the practical work of introducing socialism, 
the Russian Communists had little or no experience of 
the advanced European countries to go by (Europe provided 
experience chiefly of the parliamentary struggle) 
and, consequently, they had to lay the road to socialism 
by their own efforts, so to speak, and inevitably made 
a number of mistakes. 
Tyurk communism, on the other hand, arose in the 
course of the practical struggle for socialism, waged 
side by side with the Russian comrades, and the Tyurk 
Communists were able to utilise the practical experience 
of the Russian comrades and avoid mistakes. This circumstance 
serves as a guarantee that communism in the 
East has every chance of developing and gaining strength 
at a rapid rate.

SPEECH AT THE OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE 3 
All these circumstances determined the relatively 
mild policy of the Central Committee of the Party towards 
Tyurk communism, which is still very young, 
a policy directed towards helping the firm communist 
elements in the East to combat the above-mentioned 
weaknesses and shortcomings of Tyurk communism. 
The Central Bureau is the apparatus through which 
measures must be carried out to combat nationalist survivals 
and for the theoretical strengthening of communism 
in the eastern part of our country.

OUR DISAGREEMENTS 
Our disagreements on the trade-union question are 
not disagreements in principle about appraisal of the 
trade unions. The well-known points of our programme 
on the role of the trade unions, and the resolution of 
the Ninth Party Congress on the trade unions,2 which 
Trotsky often quotes, remain (and will remain) in force. 
Nobody disputes that the trade unions and the economic 
organisations ought to and will permeate each 
other (³coalescence²). Nobody disputes that the present 
period of the country¹s economic revival dictates the 
necessity of gradually transforming the as yet nominal 
industrial unions into real industrial unions, capable 
of putting our basic industries on their feet. In short, 
our disagreements are not disagreements about matters 
of principle. 
Nor do we disagree about the necessity of labour 
discipline in the trade unions and in the working class 
generally. The talk about a section of our Party ³letting 
the reins slip out of its hands,² and leaving the masses 
to the play of elemental forces, is foolish. The fact that 
Party elements play the leading role in the trade unions

OUR DISAGREEMENTS 5 
and that the trade unions play the leading role in the 
working class remains indisputable. 
Still less do we disagree on the question of the quality 
of the membership of the Central Committees of 
the trade unions, and of the All-Russian Central Council 
of Trade Unions. All agree that the membership of 
these institutions is far from ideal, that the ranks of the 
trade unions have been depleted by a number of military 
and other mobilisations, that the trade unions must 
get back their old officials and also get new ones, that 
they must be provided with technical resources, and 
so forth. 
No, our disagreements are not in this sphere. 
I 
TWO METHODS OF APPROACH 
TO THE MASS OF THE WORKERS 
Our disagreements are about questions of the means 
by which to strengthen labour discipline in the working 
class, the methods of approach to the mass of the workers 
who are being drawn into the work of reviving industry, 
the ways of transforming the present weak trade unions 
into powerful, genuinely industrial unions, capable of 
reviving our industry. 
There are two methods: the method of coercion (the 
military method), and the method of persuasion (the 
trade-union method). The first method by no means 
precludes elements of persuasion, but these are subordinate 
to the requirements of the coercion method and 
are auxiliary to the latter. The second method, in turn,

J. V. S T A L I N 6
does not preclude elements of coercion, but these are 
subordinate to the requirements of the persuasion method 
and are auxiliary to the latter. It is just as impermissible 
to confuse these two methods as it is to confuse the 
army with the working class. 
A group of Party workers headed by Trotsky, intoxicated 
by the successes achieved by military methods 
in the army, supposes that those methods can, and must, 
be adopted among the workers, in the trade unions, in 
order to achieve similar successes in strengthening the 
unions and in reviving industry. But this group forgets 
that the army and the working class are two different 
spheres, that a method that is suitable for the army 
may prove to be unsuitable, harmful, for the working 
class and its trade unions. 
The army is not a homogeneous mass; it consists of 
two main social groups, peasants and workers, the former 
being several times more numerous than the latter. In 
urging the necessity of employing chiefly methods of 
coercion in the army, the Eighth Party Congress3 based 
itself on the fact that our army consists mainly of peasants, 
that the peasants will not go to fight for socialism, 
that they can, and must, be compelled to fight 
for socialism by employing methods of coercion. This 
explains the rise of such purely military methods 
as the system of Commissars and Political Departments, 
Revolutionary Tribunals, disciplinary measures, 
appointment and not election to a l l posts, and so 
forth. 
In contrast to the army, the working class is a homogeneous 
social sphere; its economic position disposes 
it towards socialism, it is easily influenced by commu

OUR DISAGREEMENTS 7 
nist agitation, it voluntarily organises in trade unions 
and, as a consequence of all this, constitutes the foundation, 
the salt, of the Soviet state. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that the practical work of our industrial unions 
has been based chiefly on methods of persuasion. This 
explains the rise of such purely trade-union methods as 
explanation, mass propaganda, encouragement of initiative 
and independent activity among the mass of the 
workers, election of officials, and so forth. 
The mistake Trotsky makes is that he underrates 
the difference between the army and the working class, 
he puts the trade unions on a par with the military organisations, 
and tries, evidently by inertia, to transfer 
military methods from the army into the trade unions, 
into the working class. Trotsky writes in one of his 
documents: 
³The bare contrasting of military methods (orders, punishment) 
with trade-union methods (explanation, propaganda, independent 
activity) is a manifestation of Kautskian-Menshevik- 
Socialist-Revolutionary prejudices. . . . The very contrasting of 
labour organisations with military organisation in a workers¹ 
state is shameful surrender to Kautskyism.² 
That is what Trotsky says. 
Disregarding the irrelevant talk about ³Kautskyism,² 
³Menshevism,² and so forth, it is evident that Trotsky 
fails to understand the difference between labour organisations 
and military organisations, that he fails to 
understand that in the period of the termination of the war 
and the revival of industry it becomes necessary, inevitable, 
to contrast military with democratic (trade-union) 
methods, and that, therefore, to transfer military methods 
into the trade unions is a mistake, is harmful.

J. V. S T A L I N 8 
Failure to understand that lies at the bottom of 
the recently published polemical pamphlets of Trotsky 
on the trade unions. 
Failure to understand that is the source of Trotsky¹s 
mistakes. 
II 
CONSCIOUS DEMOCRACY AND FORCED 
³DEMOCRACY² 
Some think that talk about democracy in the trade 
unions is mere declamation, a fashion, called forth by 
certain phenomena in internal Party life, that, in time, 
people will get tired of ³chatter² about democracy and 
everything will go on in the ³old way.² 
Others believe that democracy in the trade unions 
is, essentially, a concession, a forced concession, to the 
workers¹ demands, that i t is diplomacy rather than 
real, serious business. 
Needless to say, both groups of comrades are profoundly 
mistaken. Democracy in the trade unions, i.e., 
what is usually called ³normal methods of proletarian 
democracy in the unions,² is the conscious democracy 
characteristic of mass working-class organisations, which 
presupposes consciousness of the necessity and utility 
of systematically employing methods of persuasion 
among the millions of workers organised in the trade 
unions. If that consciousness is absent, democracy becomes 
an empty sound. 
While war was raging and danger stood at the gates, 
the appeals to ³aid the front² that were issued by our 
organisations met with a ready response from the work

OUR DISAGREEMENTS 9 
ers, for the mortal danger we were in was only too palpable, 
for that danger had assumed a very concrete form 
evident to everyone in the shape of the armies of Kolchak, 
Yudenich, Denikin, Pilsudski and Wrangel, which were 
advancing and restoring the power of the landlords and 
capitalists. It was not difficult to rouse the masses at 
that time. But today, when the war danger has been 
overcome and the new, economic danger (economic 
ruin) is far from being so palpable to the masses, the 
broad masses cannot be roused merely by appeals. Of 
course, everybody feels the shortage of bread and textiles; 
but firstly, people do contrive to obtain both bread 
and textiles in one way or another and, consequently, 
the danger of a food and goods famine does not spur the 
masses to the same extent as the war danger did; secondly, 
nobody will assert that the masses are as conscious of 
the reality of the economic danger (shortage of locomotives 
and of machines for agriculture, for textile mills 
and iron and steel plants, shortage of equipment for 
electric power stations, and so forth) as they were of the 
war danger in the recent past. To rouse the millions of 
the working class for the struggle against economic ruin 
it is necessary to heighten their initiative, consciousness 
and independent activity; it is necessary by means of 
concrete facts to convince them that economic ruin is 
just as real and mortal a danger as the war danger was 
yesterday; it is necessary to draw millions of workers 
into the work of reviving industry through the medium 
of trade unions built on democratic lines. Only in this 
way is it possible to make the entire working class 
vitally interested in the struggle which the economic 
organisations are waging against economic ruin. If this

J. V. S T A L I N 10 
is not done, victory on the economic front cannot be 
achieved. 
In short, conscious democracy, the method of proletarian 
democracy in the unions, is the only correct 
method for the industrial unions. 
Forced ³democracy² has nothing in common with 
this democracy. 
Reading Trotsky¹s pamphlet The Role and Tasks 
of the Trade Unions, one might think that he, in essence, 
is ³also² in favour of the ³democratic² method. 
This has caused some comrades to think that we do 
not disagree about the methods of work in the trade 
unions. But that is absolutely wrong, for Trotsky¹s 
³democracy² is forced, half-hearted and unprincipled, 
and, as such, merely supplements the military-bureaucratic 
method, which is unsuitable for the trade 
unions. 
Judge for yourselves. 
At the beginning of November 1920, the Central 
Committee adopted, and the Communist group at the 
Fifth All-Russian Conference of Trade Unions carried 
through, a resolution stating that the ³most vigorous and 
systematic struggle must be waged against the degeneration 
of centralism and militarised forms of work into 
bureaucracy, tyranny, officialdom and petty tutelage 
over the trade unions . . . that also for the Tsektran 
(the Central Committee of the Transport Workers Union, 
led by Trotsky) the time for the specific methods of administration 
for which the Central Political Administration 
of the Railways was set up, owing to special circumstances, 
is beginning to pass away,² that, in view 
of this, the Communist group at the conference ³advises

OUR DISAGREEMENTS 11 
the Tsektran to strengthen and develop normal methods 
of proletarian democracy in the union,² and instructs 
the Tsektran ³to take an active part in the general work 
of the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions and 
to be represented in it on an equal footing with other 
trade-union associations² (see Pravda, No. 255). In spite 
of that decision, however, during the whole of November, 
Trotsky and the Tsektran continued to pursue the old, 
semi-bureaucratic and semi-military line, continued 
to rely on the Central Political Administration of 
the Railways and the Central Political Administration of 
Water Transport, strove to ³shake up,² to blow up, the 
A.R.C.C.T.U. and upheld the privileged position of the 
Tsektran compared with other trade union associations. 
More than that. In a letter ³to the members of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee,² dated November 
30, Trotsky, just as ³unexpectedly,² stated that ³the 
Central Political Administration of Water Transport . . . 
cannot possibly be dissolved within the next two or three 
months.² But what happened? Six days after that letter 
was written (on December 7), the same Trotsky, just as 
³unexpectedly,² voted in the Central Committee for 
³the immediate abolition of the Central Political Administration 
of the Railways and the Central Political 
Administration of Water Transport, and the transfer 
of all their staffs and funds to the trade-union organisation 
on the basis of normal democracy.² And he was 
one of the eight members of the Central Committee who 
voted for this against the seven who considered that the 
abolition of these institutions was no longer enough, 
and who demanded, in addition, that the existing composition 
of the Tsektran be changed. To save the existing

J. V. S T A L I N 12 
composition of the Tsektran, Trotsky voted for the abolition 
of the Central Political Administrations in the 
Tsektran. 
What had changed during those six days? Perhaps 
the railway and water transport workers had matured so 
much during those six days that they no longer needed the 
Central Political Administration of the Railways and 
the Central Political Administration of Water Transport? 
Or, perhaps, an important change in the internal 
or external political situation had taken place in that 
short period? Of course not. The fact is that the water 
transport workers were vigorously demanding that the 
Tsektran should dissolve the Central Political Administrations 
and that the composition of the Tsektran itself 
should be changed; and Trotsky¹s group, fearing defeat 
and wishing at least to retain the existing composition 
of the Tsektran, was compelled to retreat, to make partial 
concessions, which, however, satisfied nobody. 
Such are the facts. 
It scarcely needs proof that this forced, half-hearted, 
unprincipled ³democracy² has nothing in common with 
the ³normal methods of proletarian democracy in the 
unions,² which the Central Committee of the Party had 
recommended already at the beginning of November, 
and which are so essential for the revival of our industrial 
trade unions. 
* 
* 
* 
In his reply to the discussion at the meeting of the 
Communist group at the Congress of Soviets,4 Trotsky 
protested against the introduction of a political ele

OUR DISAGREEMENTS 13 
ment into the controversy about the trade unions, on 
the ground that politics had nothing to do with the matter. 
It must be said that in this Trotsky is quite wrong. 
It scarcely needs proof that in a workers¹ and peasants¹ 
state, not a single important decision affecting the whole 
country, and especially if it directly concerns the working 
class, can be carried through without in one way or 
another affecting the political condition of the country. 
And, in general, it is ridiculous and shallow to separate 
politics from economics. For that very reason every 
such decision must be weighed up in advance also from 
the political point of view. 
Judge for yourselves. 
It can be now taken as proved that the methods of 
the Tsektran, which is led by Trotsky, have been condemned 
by the practical experience of the Tsektran itself. 
Trotsky¹s aim in directing the Tsektran and influencing 
the other unions through it was to reanimate 
and revive the unions, to draw the workers into the 
task of reviving industry. But what has he actually 
achieved? A conflict with the majority of the Communists 
in the trade unions, a conflict between the majority 
of the trade unions and the Tsektran, a virtual 
split in the Tsektran, the resentment of the rank-andfile 
workers organised in trade unions against the ³Commissars.² 
In other words, far from a revival of the unions 
taking place, the Tsektran itself is disintegrating. There 
can be no doubt that if the methods of the Tsektran were 
introduced in the other unions, we would get the same 
picture of conflict, splits and disintegration. And the 
result would be that we would have dissension and a 
split in the working class.

J. V. S T A L I N 14 
Can the political party of the working class ignore 
these facts? Can it be asserted that it makes no difference 
to the political condition of the country whether we 
have a working class solidly united in integral trade 
unions, or whether it is split up into different, mutually 
hostile groups? Can it be said that the political factor 
ought not to play any role in appraising the methods 
of approach to the masses, that politics have nothing 
to do with the matter? 
Obviously not. 
The R.S.F.S.R. and its associated republics now 
have a population of about 140,000,000. Of this population, 
80 per cent are peasants. To be able to govern 
such a country, the Soviet power must enjoy the firm 
confidence of the working class, for such a country can 
be directed only through the medium of the working 
class and with the forces of the working class. But in 
order to retain and strengthen the confidence of the 
majority of the workers, it is necessary systematically 
to develop the consciousness, independent activity 
and initiative of the working class, systematically to 
educate it in the spirit of communism by organising it 
in trade unions and drawing it into the work of building 
a communist economy. 
Obviously, it is impossible to do this by coercive 
methods and by ³shaking up² the unions from above, 
for such methods split the working class (the Tsektran!) 
and engender distrust of the Soviet power. Moreover, 
it is not difficult to understand that, speaking generally, 
it is inconceivable that either the consciousness of the 
masses or their confidence in the Soviet power can be 
developed by coercive methods.

OUR DISAGREEMENTS 15 
Obviously, only ³normal methods of proletarian 
democracy in the unions,² only methods of persuasion, 
can make it possible to unite the working class, to stimulate 
its independent activity and strengthen its confidence 
in the Soviet power, the confidence that is needed 
so much now in order to rouse the country for the struggle 
against economic ruin. 
As you see, politics also speak in favour of methods 
of persuasion.

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY 
IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
Theses for the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) 
Endorsed by the Central Committee of the Party5 
I 
THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM 
AND NATIONAL OPPRESSION 
1. Modern nations are the product of a definite epoch‹ 
the epoch of rising capitalism. The process of elimination 
of feudalism and development of capitalism is at 
the same time a process of the constitution of people 
into nations. The British, French, Germans and Italians 
were formed into nations at the time of the victorious 
development of capitalism and its triumph over feudal 
disunity. 
2. Where the formation of nations on the whole 
coincided in time with the formation of centralised 
states, the nations naturally assumed state forms, they 
developed into independent bourgeois national states. 
That is what happened in Britain (excluding Ireland), 
in France and Italy. In Eastern Europe, on the contrary, 
the formation of centralised states, accelerated by the 
needs of self-defence (invasion by Turks, Mongols, etc.), 
took place before feudalism was liquidated; hence, before 
the formation of nations. As a consequence, the nations 
here did not, and could not, develop into national

IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 17 
states; instead, several mixed, multi-national bourgeois 
states were formed, usually consisting of one strong 
dominant nation and of several weak, subject nations. 
Examples: Austria, Hungary, Russia. 
3. In national states like France and Italy, which at 
first relied mainly on their own national forces, there 
was, generally speaking, no national oppression. In contrast 
to that, the multi-national states that are based 
on the domination of one nation‹more exactly, of the 
ruling class of that nation‹over the other nations are 
the original home and chief arena of national oppression 
and of national movements. The contradictions between 
the interests of the dominant nation and those of the 
subject nations are contradictions which, unless they 
are resolved, make the stable existence of a multi-national 
state impossible. The tragedy of the multi-national 
bourgeois state lies in that it cannot resolve these contradictions, 
that every attempt on its part to ³equalise² 
the nations and to ³protect² the national minorities, 
while preserving private property and class inequality, 
usually ends in another failure, in a further aggravation 
of national conflicts. 
4. The further growth of capitalism in Europe, the 
need for new markets, the quest for raw materials and 
fuel, and finally, the development of imperialism, the 
export of capital and the necessity of securing important 
sea and railway routes, led, on the one hand, to the seizure 
of new territories by the old national states and to 
the transformation of the latter into multi-national 
(colonial) states, with their inherent national oppression 
and national conflicts (Britain, France, Germany, Italy); 
on the other hand, among the dominant nations in the

J. V. S T A L I N 18 
old multi-national states they intensified the striving 
not only to retain the old state frontiers, but to expand 
them, to subjugate new (weak) nationalities at the expense 
of neighbouring states. This widened the national 
question and, finally, by the very course of developments 
merged it with the general question of the colonies; 
and national oppression was transformed from an intrastate 
question into an inter-state question, a question 
of the struggle (and war) between the ³great² imperialist 
powers for the subjugation of weak, unequal nationalities. 
5. The imperialist war, which laid bare to the roots 
the irreconcilable national contradictions and internal 
bankruptcy of the bourgeois multi-national states, extremely 
intensified the national conflicts within the victor 
colonial states (Britain, France, Italy), caused the utter 
disintegration of the vanquished old multi-national 
states (Austria, Hungary, Russia in 1917), and finally, 
as the most ³radical² bourgeois solution of the national 
question, led to the formation of new bourgeois national 
states (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Finland, 
Georgia, Armenia, etc.). But the formation of the new independent 
national states did not, and could not, bring 
about the peaceful co-existence of nationalities; it did not, 
and could not, eliminate either national inequality or national 
oppression, for the new national states, being based 
on private property and class inequality, cannot exist: 
a) without oppressing their national minorities 
(Poland, which oppresses Byelorussians, Jews, Lithuanians 
and Ukrainians; Georgia, which oppresses Ossetians, 
Abkhazians and Armenians; Yugoslavia, which 
oppresses Croatians, Bosnians, etc.);

IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 19 
b) without enlarging their territories at the expense 
of their neighbours, which gives rise to conflicts and 
wars (Poland against Lithuania, the Ukraine and Russia; 
Yugoslavia against Bulgaria; Georgia against Armenia, 
Turkey, etc.); 
c) without submitting to the financial, economic 
and military domination of the ³great² imperialist powers. 
6. Thus, the post-war period reveals a sombre picture 
of national enmity, inequality, oppression, conflicts, 
war, and imperialist brutality on the part of the nations 
of the civilised countries, both towards one another and 
towards the unequal nations. On the one hand, there are 
a few ³great² powers, which oppress and exploit all the 
dependent and ³independent² (actually totally dependent) 
national states, and there is a struggle of these 
powers among themselves in order to monopolise the 
exploitation of the national states. On the other hand, 
there is a struggle of the dependent and ³independent² 
national states against the unbearable oppression of the 
³great² powers; there is a struggle of the national states 
among themselves in order to enlarge their national 
territories; there is a struggle of each national state 
against the national minorities that it is oppressing. 
Lastly, there is an intensification of the liberation movement 
in the colonies against the ³great² powers and an 
aggravation of the national conflicts both within these 
powers and also within the national states which, as 
a rule, contain a number of national minorities. 
Such is the ³picture of the peace² bequeathed by the 
imperialist war. 
Bourgeois society has proved to be utterly incapable 
of solving the national question.

J. V. S T A L I N 20 
II 
THE SOVIET SYSTEM 
AND NATIONAL FREEDOM 
1. Whereas private property and capital inevitably 
disunite people, foment national strife and intensify 
national oppression, collective property and labour just 
as inevitably unite people, strike at the root of national 
strife and abolish national oppression. The existence 
of capitalism without national oppression is just as inconceivable 
as the existence of socialism without the 
liberation of the oppressed nations, without national 
freedom. Chauvinism and national strife are inevitable, 
unavoidable, so long as the peasantry (and the petty 
bourgeoisie in general), full of nationalist prejudices, 
follows the bourgeoisie; on the contrary, national peace 
and national freedom can be regarded as ensured if the 
peasantry follows the proletariat, i.e., if the proletarian 
dictatorship is ensured. Hence, the victory of the 
Soviets and the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship 
are a fundamental condition for abolishing national 
oppression, establishing national equality and 
guaranteeing the rights of national minorities. 
2. The experience of the Soviet revolution has fully 
confirmed this thesis. The establishment of the Soviet 
system in Russia and the proclamation of the right of 
nations to secede changed completely the relations between 
the labouring masses of the different nationalities 
in Russia, struck at the root of the old national enmity, 
removed the ground for national oppression and won 
for the Russian workers the confidence of their brothers 
of other nationalities not only in Russia, but also in

IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 21 
Europe and Asia, and heightened this confidence into 
enthusiasm, into readiness to fight for the common cause. 
The establishment of Soviet republics in Azerbaijan 
and Armenia has led to the same results, for it has 
eliminated national conflicts and has settled the ³ageold² 
enmity between the Turkish and Armenian, and 
between the Armenian and Azerbaijanian, labouring 
masses. The same must be said about the temporary 
victory of the Soviets in Hungary, Bavaria and Latvia. 
On the other hand, it can be confidently stated that the 
Russian workers could not have defeated Kolchak and 
Denikin, and the Azerbaijanian and Armenian Republics 
could not have got firmly on their feet, had they not 
eliminated national enmity and national oppression at 
home, had they not won the confidence and roused the 
enthusiasm of the labouring masses of the nationalities 
in the West and in the East. The strengthening of the 
Soviet republics and the abolition of national oppression 
are two sides of one and the same process of liberating 
the working people from imperialist bondage. 
3. But the existence of Soviet republics, even of the 
smallest dimensions, is a deadly menace to imperialism. 
The menace lies not only in that by breaking away from 
imperialism the Soviet republics were transformed from 
colonies and semi-colonies into really independent states, 
thereby depriving the imperialists of some extra territory 
and extra income, but also, and primarily, in that 
the very existence of the Soviet republics, every step 
they take in suppressing the bourgeoisie and in strengthening 
the proletarian dictatorship, constitutes tremendous 
agitation against capitalism and imperialism, agitation 
for the liberation of the dependent countries from

J. V. S T A L I N 22 
imperialist bondage, and is an insuperable element in the 
disintegration and disorganisation of capitalism in all 
its forms. Hence the inevitable struggle of ³great² imperialist 
powers against the Soviet republics, the endeavour 
of the ³great² powers to destroy these republics. 
The history of the fight of the ³great² powers against 
Soviet Russia, rousing against her one border-country 
bourgeois government after another, one group of counter-
revolutionary generals after another, closely blockading 
Soviet Russia and, in general, trying to isolate her 
economically, eloquently testifies that in the present 
state of international relations, in the conditions of capitalist 
encirclement, not a single Soviet republic, standing 
alone, can regard itself as ensured against economic 
exhaustion and military defeat by world imperialism. 
4. Therefore, the isolated existence of individual 
Soviet republics is unstable and precarious owing to 
their existence being threatened by the capitalist states. 
The common interests of defence of the Soviet republics, 
in the first place, the task of restoring the productive 
forces destroyed by the war, in the second place, and the 
necessary assistance the grain-growing Soviet republics 
must render those which do not grow grain, in the third 
place, all imperatively dictate the necessity of a state 
union of the individual Soviet republics as the only 
means of salvation from imperialist bondage and national 
oppression. The national Soviet republics which 
have liberated themselves from ³their own² and the 
³foreign² bourgeoisie can maintain their existence and 
defeat the combined forces of imperialism only by uniting 
in a close state union, or they will not defeat them 
at all.

J. V. S T A L I N 23 
5. A federation of Soviet republics based on common 
military and economic interests is the general form 
of the state union that will make it possible: 
a) to ensure the integrity and economic development 
of each individual republic and of the federation as a 
whole; 
b) to embrace all the diversity as regards manner of 
life, culture and economic condition of the various nations 
and nationalities, which are at present at different 
stages of development, and to apply corresponding forms 
of federation; 
c) to arrange the peaceful co-existence and fraternal 
co-operation of the nations and nationalities which, in 
one way or another, have linked their fate with that 
of the federation. 
Russia¹s experience in employing different forms of 
federation, ranging from federation based on Soviet 
autonomy (Kirghizia, Bashkiria, Tataria, the Highlands, 
Daghestan) to federation based on treaty relations with 
independent Soviet republics (the Ukraine, Azerbaijan), 
and permitting intermediate stages (Turkestan, Byelorussia), 
has fully proved the expediency and flexibility 
of federation as the general form of state union of 
the Soviet republics. 
6. But federation can be stable and the results of 
federation effective only if it is based on mutual confidence 
and the voluntary consent of the federating countries. 
If the R.S.F.S.R. is the only country in the world 
where the experiment in the peaceful co-existence and 
fraternal co-operation of a number of nations and nationalities 
has been successful, it is because there are 
here neither dominant nor subject nations, neither

J. V. S T A L I N 24 
metropolises nor colonies, neither imperialism nor national 
oppression; federation here rests on mutual confidence 
and the voluntary striving of the labouring masses 
of the different nations towards union. This voluntary 
character of the federation must be preserved without 
fail, for only such a federation can serve as the transitional 
stage to that higher unity of the toilers of all 
countries in a single world economic system, the necessity 
for which is becoming increasingly apparent. 
III 
THE IMMEDIATE TASKS 
OF THE R.C.P. 
1. The R.S.F.S.R. and the Soviet republics associated 
with it have a population of about 140,000,000. 
Of these non-Great-Russians number about 65,000,000 
(Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Kirghiz, Uzbeks, Turkmenians, 
Tajiks, Azerbaijanians, Volga Tatars, Crimean 
Tatars, Bukharans, Khivans, Bashkirs, Armenians, Chechens, 
Kabardinians, Ossetians, Cherkesses, Ingushes, 
Karachais, Balkarians,* Kalmyks, Karelians, Avars, 
Darghinians, Kasi-kumukhians, Kyurinians, Kumyks,** 
Mari, Chuvashes, Votyaks, Volga Germans, Buryats, 
Yakuts, etc.). 
The policy of tsarism, the policy of the landlords 
and the bourgeoisie towards these peoples, was to kill 
* The last seven nationalities are united in the ³Highland² 
group. 
** The last five nationalities are united in the ³Daghestanian² 
group.

IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 25 
whatever germs of statehood existed among them, to 
mutilate their culture, to restrict their languages, to 
keep them in ignorance, and lastly, as far as possible 
to Russify them. The result of this policy was the 
underdevelopment and political backwardness of these 
peoples. 
Now that the landlords and the bourgeoisie have been 
overthrown and Soviet power has been proclaimed by 
the masses of the people in these countries too, the Party¹s 
task is to help the labouring masses of the non-Great- 
Russian peoples to catch up with central Russia, which 
has forged ahead, to help them: 
a) to develop and strengthen their Soviet statehood 
in forms corresponding to the national complexion of 
these peoples; 
b) to set up their courts, administration, economic 
organisations and organs of power, functioning in the 
native languages and staffed with local people familiar 
with the manner of life and the mentality of the local 
population; 
c) to develop their press, schools, theatres, recreation 
clubs, and cultural and educational institutions 
generally, functioning in the native languages. 
2. If from the 65,000,000 non-Great-Russian population 
we exclude the Ukraine, Byelorussia, a small part 
of Azerbaijan, and Armenia, which in some degree have 
been through the period of industrial capitalism, 
there remains a population of about 25,000,000, mainly 
Tyurks (Turkestan, the greater part of Azerbaijan, Daghestan, 
the Highlanders, Tatars, Bashkirs, Kirghiz, etc.), 
who have not gone through any capitalist development, 
have little or no industrial proletariat, and in most

J. V. S T A L I N 26 
cases have retained their pastoral economy and patriarchal-
tribal manner of life (Kirghizia, Bashkiria, North 
Caucasus), or who have not gone beyond the primitive 
forms of a semi-patriarchal, semi-feudal manner of life 
(Azerbaijan, the Crimea, etc.) but have already been 
drawn into the common channel of Soviet development. 
The Party¹s task in relation to the labouring masses 
of these peoples (in addition to the task indicated in 
Point 1) is to help them to eliminate the survivals of 
patriarchal-feudal relations and to draw them into the 
work of building a Soviet economy on the basis of Soviets 
of toiling peasants, by creating among these peoples 
strong communist organisations capable of utilising 
the experience of the Russian workers and peasants in 
Soviet-economic construction and, at the same time, 
capable of taking into account in their construction work 
all the specific features of the economic situation, the 
class structure, culture and manner of life of each nationality 
concerned, while refraining from mechanically 
transplanting from central Russia economic measures 
that are suitable only for a different, higher stage of 
economic development. 
3. If from the 25,000,000, mainly Tyurk, population 
we exclude Azerbaijan, the greater part of Turkestan, the 
Tatars (Volga and Crimean), Bukhara, Khiva, Daghestan, 
part of the Highlanders (Kabardinians, Cherkesses and 
Balkarians) and several other nomad nationalities who 
have already become settled and have firmly established 
themselves in a definite territory, there remain about 
6,000,000 Kirghiz, Bashkirs, Chechens, Ossetians and 
Ingushes, whose lands had until recently served as objects 
of colonisation by Russian settlers, who have man

IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 27 
aged to take from them the best arable land and are 
steadily pushing them into the barren desert. 
The policy of tsarism, the policy of the landlords 
and the bourgeoisie, was to colonise these districts as 
much as possible with kulak elements from among Russian 
peasants and Cossacks, converting the latter into 
a reliable support for dominant-nation strivings. The 
result of this policy was the gradual extinction of the 
native population (Kirghiz, Bashkirs) who had been 
driven into the wilderness. 
The Party¹s task in relation to the labouring masses 
of these nationalities (apart from the tasks mentioned 
in Points 1 and 2) is to unite their efforts with those of 
the labouring masses of the local Russian population in 
the struggle for liberation from the kulaks in general, 
and from the rapacious Great-Russian kulaks in particular, 
to help them by every possible means to throw off the 
yoke of the kulak colonisers and in this way supply them 
with arable land necessary for a human existence. 
4. In addition to the above-mentioned nations and 
nationalities which have a definite class structure and 
occupy a definite territory, there s t i l l exist in the 
R.S.F.S.R. floating national groups, national minorities, 
interspersed among compact majorities of other 
nationalities, and in most cases having neither a definite 
class structure nor a definite territory (Letts, Estonians, 
Poles, Jews and other national minorities). The 
policy of tsarism was to obliterate these minorities by 
every possible means, even by pogroms (the anti-Jewish 
pogroms). 
Now that national privileges have been abolished, 
that equality of rights for nations has been put into effect,

J. V. S T A L I N 28 
and that the right of national minorities to free national 
development is guaranteed by the very character of 
the Soviet system, the Party¹s task in relation to the 
labouring masses of these national groups is to help them 
to make the fullest use of their guaranteed right to free 
development. 
5. The communist organisations in the border regions 
are developing under somewhat peculiar conditions 
which retard the normal growth of the Party in these 
regions. On the one hand, the Great-Russian Communists 
who are working-in the border regions and who 
grew up during the existence of a ³dominant² nation 
and did not suffer national oppression, often underrate 
the importance of specific national features in their Party 
work, or completely ignore them; they do not, in their 
work, take into account the specific features of the class 
structure, culture, manner of life and past history of the 
nationality concerned, and thus vulgarise and distort 
the Party¹s policy on the national question. This leads 
to a deviation from communism to a dominant-nation 
and colonialist outlook, to Great-Russian chauvinism. 
On the other hand, the Communists from the local native 
population who experienced the harsh period of national 
oppression, and who have not yet fully freed themselves 
from the haunting memories of that period, often exaggerate 
the importance of specific national features in 
their Party work, leave the class interests of the working 
people in the shade, or simply confuse the interests 
of the working people of the nation concerned with the 
³national² interests of that nation; they are unable to 
separate the former from the latter and base their Party 
work on them. That, in its turn, leads to a deviation

IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE PARTY IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 29 
from communism towards bourgeois-democratic nationalism, 
which sometimes assumes the form of Pan-Islamism, 
Pan-Turkism6 (in the East). 
This congress, emphatically condemning both these 
deviations as harmful and dangerous to the cause of 
communism, considers it necessary to point out the 
special danger and special harmfulness of the first-mentioned 
deviation, the deviation towards a dominant 
nation, colonialist outlook. The congress reminds the 
Party that unless colonialist and nationalist survivals 
in its ranks are overcome it will be impossible to 
build up in the border regions strong, genuinely communist 
organisations which are linked with the masses 
and which unite in their ranks the proletarian elements 
of the local native and Russian populations on 
the basis of internationalism. The congress therefore 
considers that the elimination of nationalist and, primarily, 
of colonialist vacillations in communism is one 
of the Party¹s most important tasks in the border 
regions. 
6. As a result of the successes achieved on the war 
fronts, particularly after the liquidation of Wrangel, 
in some of the backward border regions where there is 
little or no industrial proletariat, there has been an 
increased influx of petty-bourgeois nationalist elements 
into the Party for the sake of a career. Taking into consideration 
the Party¹s position as the actual ruling force, 
these elements usually disguise themselves in communist 
colours and often pour into the Party in entire groups, 
carrying with them a spirit of thinly disguised chauvinism 
and disintegration, while the generally weak Party organisations 
in the border regions are not always able to

J. V. S T A L I N 30 
resist the temptation to ³expand² the Party by accepting 
new members. 
Calling for a resolute struggle against all pseudocommunist 
elements that attach themselves to the Party 
of the proletariat, the congress warns the Party against 
³expansion² through accepting intellectual, petty-bourgeois 
nationalist elements. The congress considers that 
the ranks of the Party in the border regions should be 
reinforced chiefly from the proletarians, the poor, and 
the labouring peasants of these regions, and that at the 
same time work should be conducted to strengthen the 
Party organisations in the border regions by improving 
the quality of their membership.

1. REPORT ON THE IMMEDIATE TASKS 
OF THE PARTY 
IN THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
March 10, 1921 
Before proceeding to deal with the Party¹s concrete 
immediate tasks in the national question, it is necessary 
to lay down certain premises, without which the national 
question cannot be solved. These premises concern 
the emergence of nations, the origin of national oppression, 
the forms assumed by national oppression in the 
course of historical development, and then the methods 
of solving the national question in the different periods 
of development. 
There have been three such periods. 
The first period was that of the elimination of feudalism 
in the West and of the triumph of capitalism. 
That was the period in which people were constituted into 
nations I have in mind countries like Britain (excluding 
Ireland), France and Italy. In the West‹in Britain, 
France, Italy and, partly, Germany‹the period 
of the liquidation of feudalism and the constitution of 
people into nations coincided, on the whole, with the 
period in which centralised states appeared; as a consequence 
of this, in the course of their development, the 
nations there assumed state forms. And since there were 
no other national groups of any considerable size within 
these states, there was no national oppression there.

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR

DISTRIBUTION 
34 
In Eastern Europe, on the contrary, the process of 
formation of nations and of the liquidation of feudal 
disunity did not coincide in time with the process of 
formation of centralised states. I have in mind Hungary, 
Austria and Russia. In those countries capitalism had 
not yet developed; it was, perhaps, only just beginning 
to develop; but the needs of defence against the invasion 
of the Turks, Mongols and other Oriental peoples called 
for the immediate formation of centralised states capable 
of checking the onslaught of the invaders. Since the process 
of formation of centralised states in Eastern Europe 
was more rapid than the process of the constitution of 
people into nations, mixed states were formed there, consisting 
of several peoples who had not yet formed themselves 
into nations, but who were already united in a 
common state. 
Thus, the first period is characterised by nations 
making their appearance at the dawn of capitalism; 
in Western Europe purely national states arose in which 
there was no national oppression, whereas in Eastern 
Europe multi-national states arose headed by one, more 
developed, nation as the dominant nation, to which the 
other, less developed, nations were politically and later 
economically subjected. These multi-national states in 
the East became the home of that national oppression 
which gave rise to national conflicts, to national movements, 
to the national question, and to various methods 
of solving this question. 
The second period in the development of national 
oppression and of methods of combating it coincided 
with the period of the appearance of imperialism in the 
West, when, in its quest for markets, raw materials,

THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 35 
fuel and cheap labour power, and in its fight for the export 
of capital and for securing important railway and sea 
routes, capitalism burst out of the framework of the 
national state and enlarged its territory at the expense 
of its neighbours, near and distant. In this second period 
the old national states in the West‹Britain, Italy 
and France‹ceased to be national states, i.e., owing 
to having seized new territories, they were transformed 
into multi-national, colonial states and thereby became 
arenas of the same kind of national and colonial oppression 
as already existed in Eastern Europe. Characteristic 
of this period in Eastern Europe was the awakening 
and strengthening of the subject nations (Czechs, Poles 
and Ukrainians) which, as a result of the imperialist 
war, led to the break-up of the old, bourgeois multinational 
states and to the formation of new national 
states which are held in bondage by the so-called great 
powers. 
The third period is the Soviet period, the period of 
the abolition of capitalism and of the elimination of 
national oppression, when the question of dominant and 
subject nations, of colonies and metropolises, is relegated 
to the archives of history, when before us, in the 
territory of the R.S.F.S.R., nations are arising having 
equal rights to development, but which have retained 
a certain historically inherited inequality owing to their 
economic, political and cultural backwardness. The 
essence of this national inequality consists in the fact 
that, as a result of historical development, we have inherited 
from the past a situation in which one nation, 
namely, the Great-Russian, is politically and industrially 
more developed than the other nations. Hence the actual

J. V. S T A L I N 36 
inequality, which cannot be abolished in one year, but 
which must be abolished by giving the backward nations 
and nationalities economic, political and cultural assistance. 
Such are the three periods of development of the 
national question that have historically passed before us. 
The first two periods have one feature in common, 
namely: in both periods nations suffer oppression and 
bondage, as a consequence of which the national struggle 
continues and the national question remains unsolved. 
But there is also a difference between them, namely: 
in the first period the national question remains within 
the framework of each multi-national state and affects 
only a few, chiefly European, nations; in the second 
period, however, the national question is transformed 
from an intra-state question into an inter-state question‹ 
into a question of war between imperialist states to keep 
the unequal nationalities under their domination, to 
subject to their influence new nationalities and races 
outside Europe. 
Thus, in this period, the national question, which 
formerly had been of significance only in cultured countries, 
loses its isolated character and merges with the 
general question of the colonies. 
The development of the national question into the 
general colonial question was not a historical accident. 
It was due, firstly, to the fact that during the imperialist 
war the imperialist groups of belligerent powers 
themselves were obliged to appeal to the colonies from 
which they obtained man-power for their armies. Undoubtedly, 
this process, this inevitable appeal of the 
imperialists to the backward nationalities of the colo

THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 37 
nies, could not fail to rouse these races and nationalities 
for the struggle for liberation. The second factor 
that caused the widening of the national question, its 
development into the general colonial question embracing 
the whole world, first in the sparks and later in the 
flames of the liberation movement, was the attempt 
of the imperialist groups to dismember Turkey and to 
put an end to her existence as a state. Being more developed 
as a state than the other Moslem peoples, Turkey 
could not resign herself to such a prospect; she raised the 
banner of struggle and rallied the peoples of the East 
around herself against imperialism. The third factor was 
the appearance of Soviet Russia, which achieved a number 
of successes in the struggle against imperialism and 
thereby naturally inspired the oppressed peoples of the 
East, awakened them, roused them for the struggle, and 
thus made it possible to create a common front of oppressed 
nations stretching from Ireland to India. 
Such are all those factors which in the second stage 
of the development of national oppression not only prevented 
bourgeois society from solving the national question, 
not only prevented the establishment of peace 
among the nations, but, on the contrary, fanned the 
spark of national struggle into the flames of the struggle 
of the oppressed peoples, the colonies and the semicolonies 
against world imperialism. 
Obviously, the only regime that is capable of solving 
the national question, i.e., the regime that is capable 
of creating the conditions for ensuring the peaceful 
co-existence and fraternal co-operation of different nations 
and races, is the Soviet regime, the regime of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat.

J. V. S T A L I N 38 
It scarcely needs proof that under the rule of capital, 
with private ownership of the means of production 
and the existence of classes, equal rights for nations 
cannot be guaranteed; that as long as the power of capital 
exists, as long as the struggle for the possession of 
the means of production goes on, there can be no equal 
rights for nations, just as there can be no co-operation 
between the labouring masses of the different nations. 
History tells us that the only way to abolish national 
inequality, the only way to establish a regime of fraternal 
co-operation between the labouring masses of the 
oppressed and non-oppressed nations, is to abolish capitalism 
and establish the Soviet system. 
Further, history shows that although individual peoples 
succeed in liberating themselves from their own national 
bourgeoisie and also from the ³foreign² bourgeoisie, 
i.e., although they succeed in establishing the Soviet 
system in their respective countries, they cannot, as 
long as imperialism exists, maintain and successfully 
defend their separate existence unless they receive the 
economic and military support of neighbouring Soviet 
republics. The example of Hungary provides eloquent 
proof that unless the Soviet republics form a state union, 
unless they unite and form a single military and economic 
force, they cannot withstand the combined forces 
of world imperialism either on the military or on the 
economic front. 
A federation of Soviet republics is the needed form 
of state union, and the living embodiment of this form 
is the R.S.F.S.R. 
Such, comrades, are the premises that I wanted to 
speak of here first of all, before proceeding to prove

THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 39 
that our Party must take certain steps in the matter of 
solving the national question within the R.S.F.S.R. 
Although, under the Soviet regime in Russia and in 
the republics associated with her, there are no longer 
either dominant or nations without rights, no metropolises 
or colonies, no exploited or exploiters, nevertheless, 
the national question still exists in Russia. The 
essence of the national question in the R.S.F.S.R. lies 
in abolishing the actual backwardness (economic, political 
and cultural) that some of the nations have inherited 
from the past, to make it possible for the backward 
peoples to catch up with central Russia in political, 
cultural and economic respects. 
Under the old regime, the tsarist government did 
not, and could not, make any effort to develop the statehood 
of the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Turkestan and other 
border regions; it opposed the development of the statehood, 
as well as of the culture, of the border regions, 
endeavouring forcibly to assimilate their native populations. 
Further, the old state, the landlords and capitalists, 
left us a heritage of such downtrodden nationalities as 
the Kirghiz, Chechens and Ossetians, whose lands were 
colonised by Cossack and kulak elements from Russia. 
Those nationalities were doomed to incredible suffering 
and to extinction. 
Further, the position of the Great-Russian nation, 
which was the dominant nation, has left traces of its 
influence even upon Russian Communists who are unable, 
or unwilling to draw closer to the labouring masses of 
the local population, to understand their needs and to 
help them to extricate themselves from backwardness

J. V. S T A L I N 40 
and lack of culture. I am speaking of those few groups 
of Russian Communists who, ignoring in their work 
the specific features of the manner of life and culture of 
the border regions, sometimes deviate towards Russian 
dominant-nation chauvinism. 
Further, the position of the non-Russian nationalities 
which have experienced national oppression has not 
failed to influence the Communists among the local 
population who are sometimes unable to distinguish 
between the class interests of the labouring masses of 
their respective nations and so-called ³national² interests. 
I am speaking of the deviation towards local nationalism 
that is sometimes observed in the ranks of 
the non-Russian Communists, and which finds expression 
in the East in, for example, Pan-Islamism and Pan- 
Turkism. 
Lastly, we must save the Kirghiz, the Bashkirs and 
certain mountain races from extinction, we must provide 
them with the necessary land at the expense of the kulak 
colonisers. 
Such are the problems and tasks which together 
constitute the essence of the national question in our 
country. 
Having described these immediate tasks of the Party 
in the national question, I would like to pass to the general 
task, the task of adapting our communist policy in 
the border regions to the specific conditions of economic 
life that obtain mainly in the East. 
The point is that a number of nationalities, chiefly 
Tyurk‹comprising about 25,000,000 people‹have not 
been through, did not manage to go through, the 
period of industrial capitalism, and, therefore, have no

THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 41 
industrial proletariat, or scarcely any; consequently, 
they will have to skip the stage of industrial capitalism 
and pass from the primitive forms of economy to the 
stage of Soviet economy. To be able to perform this very 
difficult but by no means impossible operation, it is 
necessary to take into account all the specific features 
of the economic condition, and even of the historical 
past, manner of life and culture of these nationalities. It 
would be unthinkable and dangerous to transplant to the 
territories of these nationalities the measures that had 
force and significance here, in central Russia. Clearly, 
in applying the economic policy of the R.S.F.S.R., it 
is absolutely necessary to take into account all the specific 
features of the economic condition, the class structure 
and the historical past confronting us in these border 
regions. There is no need for me to dwell on the necessity 
of putting an end to such incongruities as, for example, 
the order issued by the People¹s Commissariat of Food 
that pigs be included in the food quotas to be obtained 
from Kirghizia, the Moslem population of which has 
never raised pigs. This example shows how obstinately 
some people refuse to take into account peculiarities 
of the manner of life which strike the eye of every traveller. 
I have just been handed a note requesting me to answer 
Comrade Chicherin¹s articles. Comrades, I think 
that Chicherin¹s articles, which I have read carefully, 
are nothing more than literary exercises. They contain 
four mistakes, or misunderstandings. 
Firstly, Comrade Chicherin is inclined to deny the 
contradictions among the imperialist states; he overestimates 
the international unity of the imperialists and

J. V. S T A L I N 42 
loses sight of, under-estimates, the internal contradictions 
among the imperialist groups and states (France, 
America, Britain, Japan, etc.), which exist and contain 
the seeds of war. He has over-estimated the unity of the 
imperialist upper circles and under-estimated the contradictions 
existing within that ³trust.² But these contradictions 
do exist, and the activities of the People¹s 
Commissariat of Foreign Affairs are based on them. 
Next, Comrade Chicherin makes a second mistake. 
He under-estimates the contradictions that exist between 
the dominant great powers and the recently formed 
national states (Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, etc.), 
which are in financial and military subjection to those 
great powers. Comrade Chicherin has completely lost 
sight of the fact that, although those national states are 
in subjection to the great powers, or to be more exact, 
because of this, there are contradictions between the 
great powers and those states, which made themselves 
felt, for example, in the negotiations with Poland, 
Estonia, etc. It is precisely the function of the People¹s 
Commissariat of Foreign Affairs to take all these 
contradictions into account, to base itself on them, to 
manoeuvre within the framework of these contradictions. 
Most surprisingly, Comrade Chicherin has underestimated 
this factor. 
The third mistake of Comrade Chicherin is that he 
talks too much about national self-determination, which 
has indeed become an empty slogan conveniently used 
by the imperialists. Strangely enough, Comrade Chicherin 
has forgotten that we parted with that slogan two 
years ago. That slogan no longer figures in our programme. 
Our programme does not speak of national

THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 43 
self-determination, which is a very vague slogan, but 
of the right of nations to secede, a slogan which is more 
precise and definite. These are two different things. 
Strangely enough, Comrade Chicherin fails to take this 
factor into account in his articles and, as a result, all 
his objections to the slogan which has become vague 
are like firing blank shot, for neither in my theses nor 
in the Party¹s programme is there a single word about 
³self-determination.² The only thing that is mentioned 
is the right of nations to secede. At the present time, 
however, when the liberation movement is flaring up in 
the colonies, that is for us a revolutionary slogan. Since 
the Soviet states are united voluntarily in a federation, 
the nations constituting the R.S.F.S.R. voluntarily refrain 
from exercising the right to secede. But as regards 
the colonies that are in the clutches of Britain, France, 
America and Japan, as regards such subject countries 
as Arabia, Mesopotamia, Turkey and Hindustan, i.e., 
countries which are colonies or semi-colonies, the right 
of nations to secede is a revolutionary slogan, and to 
abandon it would mean playing into the hands of the 
imperialists. 
The fourth misunderstanding is the absence of practical 
advice in Comrade Chicherin¹s articles. It is easy, 
of course, to write articles, but to justify their title: 
³In Opposition to Comrade Stalin¹s Theses² he should 
have proposed something serious, he should at least 
have made some practical counter-proposals. But I failed 
to find in his articles a single practical proposal that was 
worth considering. 
I am finishing, comrades. We have arrived at the 
following conclusions. Far from being able to solve the

J. V. S T A L I N 44 
national question, bourgeois society, on the contrary, 
in its attempts to ³solve² it, has fanned it into becoming 
the colonial question, and has created against 
itself a new front that stretches from Ireland to Hindustan. 
The only state that is capable of formulating 
and solving the national question is the state that is 
based on the collective ownership of the means and 
instruments of production‹the Soviet state. In the Soviet 
federative state there are no longer either oppressed 
or dominant nations, national oppression has been abolished; 
but owing to the actual inequality (cultural, 
economic and political) inherited from the old bourgeois 
order, inequality between the more cultured and less 
cultured nations, the national question assumes a form 
which calls for the working out of measures that will 
help the labouring masses of the backward nations and 
nationalities to make economic, political and cultural 
progress, that will enable them to catch up with central‹
proletarian‹Russia, which has forged ahead. From 
this follow the practical proposals which constitute the 
third section of the theses on the national question 
which I have submitted. (Applause.)

2. REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION 
March 10 
Comrades, the most characteristic feature of this 
congress as regards the discussion on the national question 
is that we have passed from declarations on the 
national question, through the administrative redivision 
of Russia, to the practical presentation of the question. 
At the beginning of the October Revolution we 
confined ourselves to declaring the right of peoples to 
secede. In 1918 and in 1920 we were engaged in the administrative 
redivision of Russia on national lines with 
the object of bringing the labouring masses of the backward 
peoples closer to the proletariat of Russia. Today, 
at this congress, we are presenting, on a purely practical 
basis, the question of what policy the Party should 
adopt towards the labouring masses and petty-bourgeois 
elements in the autonomous regions and independent 
republics associated with Russia. Therefore, Zatonsky¹s 
statement that the theses submitted to you 
are of an abstract character astonished me. I have before 
me his own theses which, for some reason, he did not 
submit to the congress, and in them I have not been 
able to find a single practical proposal, literally, not 
one, except, perhaps, the proposal that the word ³East- 
European² be substituted for ³R.S.F.S.R.,² and that

J. V. S T A L I N 46 
the word ³Russian² or ³Great-Russian² be substituted 
for ³All-Russian.² I have not found any other practical 
proposals in these theses. 
I pass on to the next question. 
I must say that I expected more from the delegates 
who have spoken. Russia has twenty-two border regions. 
Some of them have undergone considerable industrial 
development and differ little from central Russia in industrial 
respects; others have not been through the stage 
of capitalism and differ radically from central Russia; 
others again are very backward. It is impossible in a set 
of theses to deal with all this diversity of the border 
regions in all its concrete details. One cannot demand 
that theses of importance to the Party as a whole should 
bear only a Turkestan, an Azerbaijanian, or a Ukrainian 
character. Theses must seize on and include the common 
characteristic features of all the border regions, abstracted 
from the details. There is no other method of 
drawing up theses. 
The non-Great-Russian nations must be divided 
into several groups, and this has been done in the theses. 
The non-Russian nations comprise a total of about 
65,000,000 people. The common characteristic feature 
of all these non-Russian nations is that they lag behind 
central Russia as regards the development of their statehood. 
Our task is to exert all efforts to help these 
nations, to help their proletarians and toilers generally 
to develop their Soviet statehood in their native 
languages. This common feature is mentioned in the 
theses, in the part dealing with practical measures. 
Next, proceeding further in concretising the specific 
features of the border regions, we must single out

THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 47 
from the total of nearly 65;000,000 people of non-Russian 
nationalities some 25,000,000 Tyurks who have not 
been through the capitalist stage. Comrade Mikoyan 
was wrong when he said that in some respects Azerbaijan 
stands higher than the Russian provincial districts. He 
is obviously confusing Baku with Azerbaijan. Baku did 
not spring from the womb of Azerbaijan; it is a superstructure 
erected by the efforts of Nobel, Rothschild, 
Whishaw, and others. As regards Azerbaijan itself, it 
is a country with the most backward patriarchal-feudal 
relations. That is why I place Azerbaijan as a whole in 
the group of border regions which have not been through 
the capitalist stage, and in relation to which it is necessary 
to employ specific methods of drawing them into 
the channel of Soviet economy. That is stated in the 
theses. 
Then there is a third group which embraces not more 
than 6,000,000 people; these are mainly pastoral races, 
which still lead a tribal life and have not yet adopted 
agriculture. These are chiefly the Kirghiz, the northern 
part of Turkestan, Bashkirs, Chechens, Ossetians and 
Ingushes. The first thing to be done in relation to this 
group of nationalities is to provide them with land. The 
Kirghiz and Bashkirs here were not given the floor; the 
debate was closed. They would have told us more about 
the sufferings of the Bashkir highlanders, the Kirghiz 
and the Highlanders, who are dying out for want of land. 
But what Safarov said about this applies only to a group 
consisting of 6,000,000 people. Therefore, it is wrong 
to apply Safarov¹s practical proposals to all the border 
regions, for his amendments have no significance whatever 
for the rest of the non-Russian nationalities, which

J. V. S T A L I N 48 
comprise about 60,000,000 people. Therefore, while raising 
no objection to the concretisation, supplementation 
and improvement of individual points moved 
by Safarov relating to certain groups of nationalities, 
I must say that these amendments should not be universalised. 
I must next make a comment on one of Safarov¹s 
amendments. In one of his amendments there has 
crept in the phrase ³national-cultural self-determination²: 
³Before the October Revolution,² it says there, ³the colonial 
and semi-colonial peoples of the eastern border regions of Russia, 
as a result of imperialist policy, had no opportunity whatever of 
sharing the cultural benefits of capitalist civilisation by means 
of their own national-cultural self-determination, education in 
their native languages,² etc. 
I must say that I cannot accept this amendment 
because it smacks of Bundism. National-cultural selfdetermination 
is a Bundist formula. We parted with 
nebulous slogans of self-determination long ago and 
there is no need to revive them. Moreover, the entire 
phrase is a most unnatural combination of words. 
Further, I have received a note alleging that we Communists 
are artificially cultivating a Byelorussian nationality. 
That is not true, for there exists a Byelorussian 
nation, which has its own language, different from Russian. 
Consequently, the culture of the Byelorussian people 
can be raised only in its native language. We heard similar 
talk five years ago about the Ukraine, about the 
Ukrainian nation. And only recently it was said that 
the Ukrainian Republic and the Ukrainian nation were 
inventions of the Germans. It is obvious, however, that 
there is a Ukrainian nation, and it is the duty of the 
Communists to develop its culture. You cannot go against

THE TENTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 49 
history. It is obvious that although Russian elements 
still predominate in the Ukrainian towns, in the course 
of time these towns will inevitably be Ukrainianised. 
About forty years ago, Riga had the appearance of a German 
city; but since towns grow at the expense of the 
countryside, and since the countryside is the guardian 
of nationality, Riga is now a purely Lettish city. About 
fifty years ago all Hungarian towns bore a German 
character; now they have become Magyarised. The same 
will happen in Byelorussia, where non-Byelorussians 
still predominate in the towns. 
In conclusion, I propose that the congress elect a 
commission, containing representatives of the regions, 
for the purpose of further concretising those practical 
proposals in the theses that interest all our border regions. 
(Applause.)

A LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 
Comrade Lenin, 
During the last three days I have had the opportunity 
to read the symposium: A Plan for the Electrification 
of Russia.8 My illness made this possible (it is an 
ill wind that blows nobody any good!). An excellent, 
well-compiled book. A masterly draft of a really single 
and really state economic plan, not in quotation marks. 
The only Marxist attempt in our time to place the Soviet 
superstructure of economically backward Russia 
on a really practical technical and production basis, the 
only possible one under present conditions. 
You remember Trotsky¹s ³plan² (his theses) of last 
year for the ³economic revival² of Russia on the basis 
of the mass application of the labour of unskilled peasant-
worker masses (the labour army) to the remnants 
of pre-war industry. How wretched, how backward, compared 
with the Goelro plan! A medieval handicraftsman 
who imagines he is an Ibsen hero called to ³save² Russia 
by an ancient saga. . . . And of what value are the 
dozens of ³single plans² which to our shame appear from 
time to time in our press‹the childish prattle of preparatory-
school pupils. . . . Or again, the philistine ³realism² 
(in fact Manilovism) of Rykov, who continues to

A LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 51 
³criticise² the Goelro and is immersed to his ears in 
routine. . . . 
In my opinion: 
1) Not a single minute more must be wasted on idle 
talk about the plan. 
2) A p r a c t i c a l start on the work m u s t b e 
m a d e immediately. 
3) To this start must be devoted at least one-third 
of our work (two-thirds will be required for ³current² 
needs) in transporting materials and men, restoring 
enterprises, distributing labour forces, delivering foodstuffs, 
organising supply bases and supply itself, and 
so on. 
4) Since the staff of the Goelro, for all their excellent 
qualities, lack a sound practical outlook (a professorial 
impotence can be detected in the articles), we must 
without fail include in the planning commission live 
practical men who act on the principle‹³Report the fulfilment,² 
³Fulfil on time,² etc. 
5) Pravda, Izvestia, and especially Ekonomicheskaya 
Zhizn9 must be instructed to popularise the Plan for the 
Electrification both as a whole and as regards its concrete 
points dealing with individual parts, bearing in 
mind that there is o n l y o n e ³single economic plan² 
‹the Plan for the Electrification, and that all other 
³plans² are just idle talk, empty and harmful. 
Yours, 
Stalin

CONCERNING THE PRESENTATION 
OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
The presentation of the national question as given 
by the Communists differs essentially from the presentation 
adopted by the leaders of the Second and Twoand-
a-Half Internationals10 and by all the various ³Socialist,² 
³Social-Democratic,² Menshevik, Socialist- 
Revolutionary and other parties. 
It is particularly important to note four principal 
points that are the most characteristic and distinguishing 
features of the new presentation of the national question, 
features which draw a line between the old and 
the new conceptions of the national question. 
The first point is the merging of the national question, 
as a part, with the general question of the liberation 
of the colonies, as a whole. In the epoch of the Second 
International it was usual to confine the national 
question to a narrow circle of questions relating exclusively 
to the ³civilised² nations. The Irish, the Czechs, 
the Poles, the Finns, the Serbs, the Armenians, the 
Jews and some other European nationalities‹such was 
the circle of unequal nations in whose fate the Second 
International took an interest. The tens and hundreds

CONCERNING THE PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION 53 
of millions of people in Asia and Africa who are suffering 
from national oppression in its crudest and most brutal 
form did not, as a rule, come within the field of vision 
of the ³socialists.² They did not venture to place whites 
and blacks, ³uncultured² Negroes and ³civilised² Irish, 
³backward² Indians and ³enlightened² Poles on the 
same footing. It was tacitly assumed that although it 
might be necessary to strive for the liberation of the 
European unequal nations, it was entirely unbecoming 
for ³respectable socialists² to speak seriously of the 
liberation of the colonies, which were ³necessary² for 
the ³preservation² of ³civilisation.² These socialists, 
save the mark, did not even suspect that the abolition 
of national oppression in Europe is inconceivable without 
the liberation of the colonial peoples of Asia and Africa 
from imperialist oppression, that the former is organically 
bound up with the latter. It was the Communists 
who first revealed the connection between the national 
question and the question of the colonies, who proved 
it theoretically and made it the basis of their practical 
revolutionary activities. That broke down the wall 
between whites and blacks, between the ³cultured² 
and the ³uncultured² slaves of imperialism. This circumstance 
greatly facilitated the co-ordination of the 
struggle of the backward colonies with the struggle of 
the advanced proletariat against the common enemy, 
imperialism. 
The second point is that the vague slogan of the right 
of nations to self-determination has been replaced by the 
clear revolutionary slogan of the right of nations and 
colonies to secede, to form independent states. When 
speaking of the right to self-determination, the leaders

J. V. S T A L I N 54 
of the Second International did not as a rule even hint 
at the right to secede‹the right to self-determination 
was at best interpreted to mean the right to autonomy 
in general. Springer and Bauer, the ³experts² on the 
national question, even went so far as to convert the 
right to self-determination into the right of the oppressed 
nations of Europe to cultural autonomy, that is, the right 
to have their own cultural institutions, while all political 
(and economic) power was to remain in the hands 
of the dominant nation. In other words, the right of 
the unequal nations to self-determination was converted 
into the privilege of the dominant nations to wield 
political power, and the question of secession was excluded. 
Kautsky, the ideological leader of the Second International, 
associated himself in the main with this 
essentially imperialist interpretation of self-determination 
as given by Springer and Bauer. It is not surprising 
that the imperialists, realising how convenient 
this feature of the slogan of self-determination was for 
them, proclaimed the slogan their own. As we know, 
the imperialist war, the aim of which was to enslave 
peoples, was fought under the flag of self-determination. 
Thus the vague slogan of self-determination was converted 
from an instrument for the liberation of nations, 
for achieving equal rights for nations, into an instrument 
for taming nations, an instrument for keeping 
nations in subjection to imperialism. The course of events 
in recent years all over the world, the logic of revolution 
in Europe, and, lastly, the growth of the liberation 
movement in the colonies demanded that this, now reactionary 
slogan should be cast aside and replaced by 
another slogan, a revolutionary slogan, capable of dispel

CONCERNING THE PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION 55 
ling the atmosphere of distrust of the labouring masses 
of the unequal nations towards the proletarians of 
the dominant nations and of clearing the way towards 
equal rights for nations and towards the unity of the toilers 
of these nations. Such a slogan is the one issued by the 
Communists proclaiming the right of nations and colonies 
to secede. 
The merits of this slogan are that it: 
1) removes all grounds for suspicion that the toilers 
of one nation entertain predatory designs against 
the toilers of another nation, and therefore creates a 
basis for mutual confidence and voluntary union; 
2) tears the mask from the imperialists, who hypocritically 
prate about self-determination but who are 
striving to keep the unequal peoples and colonies in 
subjection, to retain them within the framework of their 
imperialist state, and thereby intensifies the struggle 
for liberation that these nations and colonies are waging 
against imperialism. 
It scarcely needs proof that the Russian workers 
would not have gained the sympathy of their comrades 
of other nationalities in the West and the East if, having 
assumed power, they had not proclaimed the right of 
nations to secede, if they had not demonstrated in practice 
their readiness to give effect to this inalienable 
right of nations, if they had not renounced their ³rights,² 
let us say, to Finland (1917), if they had not withdrawn 
their troops from North Persia (1917), if they had not 
renounced all claims to certain parts of Mongolia, China, 
etc., etc. 
I t is equally beyond doubt that i f the policy of 
the imperialists, skilfully concealed under the flag of

J. V. S T A L I N 56 
self-determination, has nevertheless lately been meeting 
with defeat after defeat in the East, it is because, among 
other things, it has encountered there a growing liberation 
movement, which has developed on the basis of the 
agitation conducted in the spirit of the slogan of the 
right of nations to secede. This is not understood by the 
heroes of the Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals, 
who roundly abuse the Baku ³Council of Action 
and Propaganda²11 for some slight mistakes i t has 
committed; but it will be understood by everyone who 
takes the trouble to acquaint himself with the activities 
of that ³Council² during the year it has been in 
existence, and with the liberation movement in the 
Asiatic and African colonies during the past two or 
three years. 
The third point is the disclosure of the organic connection 
between the national and colonial question and 
the question of the rule of capital, of overthrowing capitalism, 
of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the 
epoch of the Second International, the national question, 
narrowed down to the extreme, was usually regarded 
as an isolated question, unrelated to the coming proletarian 
revolution. It was tacitly assumed that the national 
question would be settled ³naturally,² before the 
proletarian revolution, by means of a series of reforms 
within the framework of capitalism; that the proletarian 
revolution could be accomplished without a radical 
settlement of the national question, and that, on the 
contrary, the national question could be settled without 
overthrowing the rule of capital, without, and before, 
the victory of the proletarian revolution. That essentially 
imperialist view runs like a red thread through the well

CONCERNING THE PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION 57 
known works of Springer and Bauer on the national 
question. But the past decade has exposed the utter 
falsity and rottenness of this conception of the national 
question. The imperialist war has shown, and the revolutionary 
experience of recent years has again confirmed 
that: 
1) the national and colonial questions are inseparable 
from the question of emancipation from the rule 
of capital; 
2) imperialism (the highest form of capitalism) cannot 
exist without the political and economic enslavement 
of the unequal nations and colonies; 
3) the unequal nations and colonies cannot be liberated 
without overthrowing the rule of capital; 
4) the victory of the proletariat cannot be lasting 
without the liberation of the unequal nations and colonies 
from the yoke of imperialism. 
If Europe and America may be called the front or the 
arena of the major battles between socialism and imperialism, 
the unequal nations and the colonies, with their 
raw materials, fuel, food and vast store of man-power, 
must be regarded as the rear, the reserve of imperialism. 
To win a war it is necessary not only to triumph at the 
front, but also to revolutionise the enemy¹s rear, his 
reserves. Hence, the victory of the world proletarian 
revolution may be regarded as assured only if the proletariat 
is able to combine its own revolutionary struggle 
with the liberation movement of the labouring masses 
of the unequal nations and the colonies against the 
rule of the imperialists and for the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. This ³trifle² was overlooked by the leaders 
of the Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals,

J. V. S T A L I N 58 
who divorced the national and colonial question from 
the question of power in the epoch of growing proletarian 
revolution in the West. 
The fourth point is that a new element has been introduced 
into the national question‹the element of the 
actual (and not merely juridical) equalisation of nations 
(help and co-operation for the backward nations in raising 
themselves to the cultural and economic level of the 
more advanced nations), as one of the conditions necessary 
for securing fraternal co-operation between the labouring 
masses of the various nations. In the epoch of the Second 
International the matter was usually confined to 
proclaiming ³national equality of rights²; at best, things 
went no further than the demand that such equality 
of rights should be put into effect. But national equality 
of rights, although a very important political gain 
in itself, runs the risk of remaining a mere phrase in 
the absence of adequate resources and opportunities for 
exercising this very important right. It is beyond doubt 
that the labouring masses of the backward peoples are 
not in a position to exercise the rights that are accorded 
them under ³national equality of rights² to the same 
degree to which they can be exercised by the labouring 
masses of advanced nations. The backwardness (cultural 
and economic), which some nations have inherited from the 
past, and which cannot be abolished in one or two years, 
makes itself felt. This circumstance is also perceptible 
in Russia, where a number of peoples have not gone 
through, and some have not even entered, the phase of 
capitalism and have no proletariat, or hardly any, of 
their own; where, although complete national equality 
of rights has already been established, the labouring

CONCERNING THE PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL QUESTION 59 
masses of these nationalities are not in a position to 
make adequate use of the rights they have won, owing 
to their cultural and economic backwardness. This circumstance 
will make itself felt still more ³on the morrow² 
of the victory of the proletariat in the West, when numerous 
backward colonies and semi-colonies, standing 
at most diverse levels of development, will inevitably 
appear on the scene. For that very reason the victorious 
proletariat of the advanced nations must assist, must 
render assistance, real and prolonged assistance, to the 
labouring masses of the backward nations in their cultural 
and economic development, so as to help them 
to rise to a higher stage of development and to catch 
up with the more advanced nations. Unless such aid 
is forthcoming it will be impossible to bring about the 
peaceful co-existence and fraternal co-operation of the 
toilers of the various nations and nationalities within 
a single world economic system that are so essential for 
the final triumph of socialism. 
But from this i t follows that we cannot confine 
ourselves merely to ³national equality of rights,² that 
we must pass from ³national equality of rights² to measures 
that will bring about real equality of nations, 
that we must proceed to work out and put into effect 
practical measures in relation to: 
1) the study of the economic conditions, manner of 
life and culture of the backward nations and nationalities;
2) the development of their culture; 
3) their political education; 
4) their gradual and painless introduction to the 
higher forms of economy;

J. V. S T A L I N 60 
5) the organisation of economic co-operation between 
the toilers of the backward and of the advanced 
nations. 
Such are the four principal points which distinguish 
the new presentation of the national question given by 
the Russian Communists.

GREETING TO THE FIRST CONGRESS 
OF HIGHLAND WOMEN12 
Convey my fraternal greetings to the First Congress 
of Working Women of the Highland Republic.13 I deeply 
regret that I am unable to be present at the congress 
owing to ill health. 
Comrade Highland Women, there has not been a 
single important movement for emancipation in the history 
of mankind in which women have not closely participated, 
for every step taken by an oppressed class along 
the road towards emancipation brings with it an improvement 
in the position of women. The movement for 
the emancipation of the slaves in ancient times, as well 
as the movement for the emancipation of the serfs in 
modern times, had in its ranks not only men, but also 
women‹fighters and martyrs, who with their blood 
sealed their devotion to the cause of the toilers. Lastly, 
the present movement for the emancipation of the proletariat‹
the profoundest and mightiest of all the emancipation 
movements of mankind‹has brought to the fore 
not only heroines and women martyrs, but also a mass 
socialist movement of millions of working women, who 
are fighting victoriously under the common proletarian 
banner.

J. V. S T A L I N 62 
Compared with this mighty working-women¹s movement, 
the liberal movement of the bourgeois women 
intellectuals is a child¹s game, invented as a pastime. 
I am convinced that the Congress of Highland Women 
will conduct its proceedings under the Red Flag.

THE POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 
OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS 
Synopsis of a Pamphlet 
I 
DEFINITION OF TERMS 
AND SUBJECT OF INVESTIGATION 
1) The limits of operation of political strategy and 
tactics, their field of application. If it is granted that the 
proletarian movement has two sides, objective and subjective, 
then the field of operation of strategy and tactics 
is undoubtedly limited to the subjective side of the 
movement. The o b j e c t i v e side comprises the processes 
of development which take place outside of and 
around the proletariat independently of its will and of the 
will of its party, processes which, in the final analysis, 
determine the development of the whole of society. The 
s u b j e c t i v e side comprises the processes which take 
place within the proletariat as the reflection in the consciousness 
of the proletariat of the objective processes, 
accelerating or retarding the latter, but not determining 
them. 
2) The Marxist t h e o r y, which primarily studies 
objective processes in their development and decline, 
defines the trend of development and points to the class 
or classes which are inevitably rising to power, or are 
inevitably falling, which must fall.

J. V. S T A L I N 64 
3) The Marxist p r o g r a m m e, based on deductions 
from the theory, defines the aim of the movement 
of the rising class, in the present case the proletariat, 
during a certain period in the development of capitalism, 
or during the whole of the capitalist period (the minimum 
programme and the maximum programme). 
4) S t r a t e g y, guided by the programme, and 
based on a calculation of the contending forces, internal 
(national) and international, defines the g e n e r a l 
r o u t e, the g e n e r a l d i r e c t i o n, in which the 
revolutionary proletarian movement must be guided with 
a view to achieving the greatest results under the incipient 
and developing relation of forces. In conformity 
with this it outlines a plan of the disposition of the forces 
of the proletariat and of its allies on the social front 
(g e n e r a l d i s p o s i t i o n). ³Outlining a plan of 
the disposition of forces² must not be confused with 
the actual (concrete and practical) operation of disposing, 
allocating the forces, which is carried out jointly 
by tactics and strategy. That does not mean that strategy 
is limited to defining the route and outlining a plan of 
the disposition of the fighting forces in the proletarian 
camp; on the contrary, it directs the struggle and introduces 
corrections in current tactics during the whole 
period of a turn, making skilful use of the available reserves, 
and manoeuvring with the object of supporting 
the tactics. 
5) T a c t i c s, guided by strategy and by the experience 
of the revolutionary movement at home and in 
neighbouring countries, taking into account at every 
given moment the state of forces within the proletariat 
and its allies (higher or lower level of culture, higher

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 65 
or lower degree of organisation and political consciousness, 
existing traditions, forms of the movement, forms 
of organisation, main and auxiliary), and also in the 
enemy¹s camp, taking advantage of disharmony or any 
confusion in the enemy¹s camp‹indicate such definite 
ways of winning the broad masses to the side of the revolutionary 
proletariat and of placing them in their fighting 
positions on the social front (in fulfilment of the 
plan for the disposition of forces outlined in the strategic 
plan) as will most surely prepare the success of strategy. 
In conformity with this, they issue or change the 
Party¹s slogans and directives. 
6) S t r a t e g y alters at turns, radical changes, in 
history; it embraces the period from one turn (radical 
change) to another. Hence, it directs the movement towards 
the general objective that covers the interests of 
the proletariat during the whole of this period. Its aim 
is to w i n t h e w a r of classes that is waged during 
the whole of this period and, therefore, it remains unchanged 
during this period. 
T a c t i c s, on the other hand, are determined by 
the flows and ebbs on the basis of the given turn, the 
given strategic period, by the relation of the contending 
forces, by the forms of the struggle (movement), by 
the tempo of the movement, by the arena of the struggle 
at each given moment, in each given district. And since 
these factors change in conformity with the conditions 
of place and time during the period from one turn to 
another, tactics, which do not cover the whole war, but 
only individual battles, that lead to the winning or loss 
of the war, change (may change) several times in the 
course of the strategic period. A strategic period is longer

J. V. S T A L I N 66 
than a tactical period. Tactics are subordinate to the 
interests of strategy. Speaking generally, tactical successes 
prepare for strategic successes. The function of 
tactics is to lead the masses into the struggle in such a 
way, to issue such slogans, to lead the masses to new positions 
in such a way, that the struggle should, in sum, 
result in the winning of the war, i.e., in strategic success. 
But cases occur when a tactical success frustrates, 
or postpones, strategic success. In view of this, it is 
necessary, in such cases, to forgo tactical successes. 
Example. The agitation against the war that we conducted 
among the workers and soldiers at the beginning 
of 1917, under Kerensky, undoubtedly resulted in a tactical 
setback, for the masses dragged our speakers off 
the platforms, beat them up, and sometimes tore them 
limb from limb; instead of the masses being drawn into 
the Party, they drew away from it. But in spite of the 
tactical setback, this agitation brought nearer a big strategic 
success, for the masses soon realised that we were 
right in agitating against the war, and later this hastened 
and facilitated their going over to the side of 
the Party. 
Or again. The Comintern¹s demand for a dissociation 
from the Reformists and Centrists in conformity with 
the twenty-one conditions,14 undoubtedly involves a 
certain tactical setback for it deliberately reduces the 
number of ³supporters² of the Comintern and temporarily 
weakens the latter; but it leads to a big strategic 
gain by ridding the Comintern of unreliable elements, 
which will undoubtedly strengthen the Comintern, will 
weld its ranks more closely, i.e., will enhance its power 
generally.

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 67 
7) Agitation s l o g a n and action slogan. These must 
not be confused. It is dangerous to do so. In the period 
from April to October 1917, the slogan ³All power to 
the Soviets² was an agitation slogan; in October it became 
an action slogan‹after the Central Committee of the 
Party, at the beginning of October (October 10), adopted 
the decision on the ³seizure of power.² In its action in 
Petrograd in April, the Bagdatyev group was guilty of 
such a confusion of slogans. 
8) D i r e c t i v e (general) is a direct call for action, 
at a c e r t a i n t i m e and in a c e r t a i n p l a c e, 
binding upon the Party. The slogan ³All power to the 
Soviets² was a propaganda slogan at the beginning of 
April (the ³theses²15); in June it became an agitation 
slogan; in October (October 10) it became an action slogan; 
but at the end of October it became an immediate directive. 
I am speaking of a general directive for the whole 
Party, having in mind that there must also be local 
directives detailing the general directive. 
9) V a c i l l a t i o n o f t h e p e t t y b o u rg 
e o i s i e especially during intensification of political 
crises (in Germany during the Reichstag elections, in 
Russia under Kerensky in April, in June and in August, 
and again in Russia during the Kronstadt events, 192116); 
this must be carefully studied, taken advantage of, taken 
into account, but to yield to it would be dangerous, fatal 
to the cause of the proletariat. Agitation slogans must 
not be changed because of such vacillation, but it is 
permissible, and sometimes necessary, to change or 
postpone a particular directive, and, perhaps, also a 
slogan (of action). Changing tactics ³overnight² means 
precisely changing a directive, or even a n a c t i o n

J. V. S T A L I N 68 
s l o g a n, but not an agitation slogan. (Cf. the calling 
off of the demonstration on June 9, 1917, and similar 
facts.) 
10) The art of the strategist and tactician lies in skilfully 
and opportunely transforming an agitation slogan 
into an action slogan, and in moulding, also opportunely 
and skilfully, an action slogan into definite, concrete, 
directives. 
II 
HISTORIC TURNS 
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIA 
1) T h e t u r n i n 1 9 0 4-0 5 (the Russo-Japanese 
war revealed the utter instability of the autocracy on 
the one hand, and the might of the proletarian and peasant 
movement, on the other) and Lenin¹s book Two Tactics17 
as the strategic plan of the Marxists corresponding 
to this turn. A turn towards the bourgeois-democratic 
revolution (this was the essence of the turn). Not a bourgeois-
liberal deal with tsarism under the hegemony of 
the Cadets, but a bourgeois-democratic revolution under 
the hegemony of the proletariat. (This was the essence of the 
strategic plan.) This plan took as its starting point that 
the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia would 
give an impetus to the socialist movement in the West, 
would unleash revolution there and help Russia to pass 
from the bourgeois to the socialist revolution (see also 
Minutes of the Third Party Congress, Lenin¹s speeches 
at the congress,18 and also his analysis of the concept 
of dictatorship both at the congress and in the pamphlet 
The Victory of the Cadets19). A calculation of the contend

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 69 
ing forces, internal and international, and, in general, 
an analysis of the economics and politics of the period 
of the turn are essential. The February Revolution 
marked the culmination of this period by carrying out 
at least two-thirds of the strategic plan outlined in Two 
Tactics. 
2) T h e t u r n i n F e b r u a r y - M a r c h 
1 9 1 7 t o w a r d s t h e S o v i e t r e v o l u t i o n 
(the imperialist war, which swept away the autocratic 
regime, revealed the utter bankruptcy of capitalism and 
showed that a socialist revolution was absolutely inevitable 
as the only way out of the crisis). 
Difference between the ³glorious² F e b r u a r y 
Revolution brought about by the people, the bourgeoisie 
and Anglo-French capital (this revolution, since it 
transferred power to the Cadets, caused no changes of 
any importance in the international situation, for it was 
a continuation of the policy of Anglo-French capital), 
and the October Revolution, which overturned everything. 
L e n i n¹s ³T h e s e s²‹as the strategic plan corresponding 
to the new turn. Dictatorship of the proletariat 
as the way out. This plan took as its starting point that 
³we shall begin the socialist revolution in Russia, overthrow 
our own bourgeoisie and in this way unleash the revolution 
in the West, and then the Western comrades will 
help us to complete our revolution.² It is essential to analyse 
the internal and international economics and politics 
of this turning-point period (the period of ³dual 
power,² coalition combinations, the Kornilov revolt as 
a symptom of the death of the Kerensky regime, unrest 
in Western countries due to discontent with the war).

J. V. S T A L I N 70 
3) The turn in October 1917 (a turn not only in Russian, 
but in world history), establishment of the proletarian 
dictatorship in Russia (October-November-December 
1917, and first half of 1918), a s a b r e a c h o f

s t s (s u m m e r o f 1 9 1 8 t o e n d o f 1 9 2 0), 
which began after the brief period of peaceful construction, 
i.e., after the Brest Peace. This course began after

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 71 
the Brest Peace, which reflected Soviet Russia¹s military 
weakness and emphasised the necessity of creating a 
Red Army in Russia to serve as the chief bulwark of 
the Soviet revolution. The hostile action of the Czechoslovaks, 
the occupation of Murmansk, Archangel, Vladivostok 
and Baku by Entente troops, and the Entente¹s 
declaration of war against Soviet Russia‹all this definitely 
marked t h e t u r n f r o m i n c i p i e n t

(Lenin¹s speeches on the Brest Peace, etc.) Since the social 
revolution was a long time coming and we were left to 
our own resources, especially after the occupation of 
the above-mentioned districts, which met with no serious 
protest on the part of the proletarians of the West, 
we were obliged to conclude the indecent Brest Peace in 
order to obtain a respite during which to build our Red 
Army and defend the Soviet Republic by our own efforts. 
³A l l f o r t h e f r o n t, a l l f o r t h e d ef 
e n c e o f t h e R e p u b l i c .² Hence, the setting 
up of the Council of Defence, etc. This 
was the war period, which left its impress upon the 
whole of Russia¹s internal and external life.

t r u c t i o n f r o m t h e b e g i n n i n g o f 1 9 2 1, 
after the defeat of Wrangel, peace with a number of 
bourgeois states, the treaty with Britain, etc. 
The war is over, but as the Western Socialists are 
not yet able to help us to restore our economy, we, being

J. V. S T A L I N 72 
economically encircled by industrially more developed 
bourgeois states, are compelled to grant concessions, to 
conclude trade agreements with individual bourgeois 
states and concession agreements with individual capitalist 
groups; in this (economic) sphere also we are left 
to our own resources, we are obliged to manoeuvre. A l l 
f o r t h e r e s t o r a t i o n o f t h e n a t i o n a l 
e c o n o m y. (See Lenin¹s well-known speeches and 
pamphlets.) The Council of Defence is transformed into 
the Council of Labour and Defence. 
6) The stages in the Party¹s development up to 1917: 
a) Welding of the main core, especially the ³Iskra² 
group, and so forth. Fight against Economism. The 
Credo.22 
b) Formation of Party cadres as the basis of the 
future workers¹ party on an all-Russian scale (1895- 
1903). The Second Party Congress. 
c) The expansion of the cadres into a workers¹ party 
and its reinforcement with new Party workers recruited 
in the course of the proletarian movement (1903-04). 
The Third Party Congress. 
d) The fight of the Mensheviks against the Party cadres 
with the object of dissolving the latter among the non- 
Party masses (the ³Labour Congress²) and the fight of 
the Bolsheviks to preserve the Party cadres as the basis 
of the Party. The London Congress and defeat of the 
advocates of a Labour Congress. 
e) Liquidators and Party Supporters. Defeat of the 
Liquidators (1908-10). 
f) 1908-16 inclusive. The period of the combination 
of illegal and legal forms of activity and the growth of the 
Party organisations in all spheres of activity.

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 73 
7) The Communist Party as a sort of Order of Knights 
of the Sword within the Soviet state, directing the organs 
of the latter and inspiring their activities. 
The importance of the old guard within this powerful 
Order. Reinforcement of the old guard with new forces 
who have been steeled during the past three or four 
years. 
Was Lenin right in waging an uncompromising struggle 
against the conciliators? Yes, for had he not done so, 
the Party would have been diluted and would have been 
not an organism, but a conglomeration of heterogeneous 
elements; it would not have been so welded and united 
internally; it would not have possessed that unexampled 
discipline and unprecedented flexibility without which 
it, and the Soviet state which it guides, could not have 
withstood world imperialism. ³The Party becomes strong 
by purging itself,² rightly said Lassalle. Quality first 
and then quantity. 
8) The question whether a proletarian party is needed 
or not, and of the role of the latter. The Party constitutes 
the officer corps and general staff of the proletariat, 
who direct the struggle of the latter in all its forms and 
in all spheres without exception, and combine the diverse 
forms of the struggle into one whole. To say that a 
Communist Party is not needed is equivalent to saying 
that the proletariat must fight without a general staff, 
without a leading core, who make a special study of 
the conditions of the struggle and work out the methods 
of fighting; it is equivalent to saying that it is better 
to fight without a general staff than with one, which is 
stupid.

QUESTIONS 
1) T h e r o l e o f t h e a u t o c r a c y b e f o r e 
a n d a f t e r t h e R u s s o - J a p a n e s e w a r. 
The Russo-Japanese war exposed the utter rottenness 
and weakness of the Russian autocracy. The successful 
general political strike in October 1905 made this weakness 
absolutely clear (a colossus with feet of clay). Further, 
1905 not only exposed the weakness of the autocracy, 
the feebleness of the liberal bourgeoisie and the might 
of the Russian proletariat, but also refuted the formerly 
current opinion that the Russian autocracy was the gendarme 
of Europe, that it was strong enough to be the gendarme 
of Europe. The facts showed that the Russian 
autocracy was unable to cope even with its own working 
class, without the aid of European capital. The Russian 
autocracy was, indeed, able to be the gendarme of Europe 
as long as the working class of Russia was dormant and 
as long as the Russian peasantry was quiescent, continuing 
to have faith in the Little Father, the tsar; but 
1905, and above all the shooting on January 9, 1905, 
roused the Russian proletariat; and the agrarian movement 
in the same year undermined the muzhik¹s faith 
in the tsar. The centre of gravity of European counterrevolution 
shifted from the Russian landlords to the Anglo-
French bankers and imperialists. The German Social-
Democrats who tried to justify their betrayal of 
the proletariat in 1914 on the plea that the war was a 
progressive war against the Russian autocracy as the 
gendarme of Europe were actually making play with a 
shadow of the past, and playing dishonestly, of course,

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 75 
for the real gendarmes of Europe, who had sufficient 
forces and funds at their command to be gendarmes, 
were not in Petrograd, but in Berlin, Paris and London. 
It now became clear to everybody that Europe was 
introducing into Russia not only socialism, but also 
counter-revolution in the shape of loans to the tsar, etc., 
whereas, in addition to political émigrés, Russia was 
introducing revolution into Europe. (At all events, in 
1905 Russia introduced the general strike into Europe 
as a weapon in the proletarian struggle.) 
2) ³Ripeness of the fruit.² How is it possible to 
determine when the moment for revolutionary upheavals 
has arrived? 
When is it possible to say that the ³fruit is ripe,² 
that the period of preparation has ended and that action 
can begin? 
‹‹ a) When the revolutionary temper of the masses 
is brimming over and our action slogans and directives 
lag behind the movement of the masses (see Lenin¹s 
³For Going Into the Duma,² the period before October 
1905), when we restrain the masses with difficulty and 
not always successfully, for example, the Putilov workers 
and machine-gunners at the time of the July demonstrations 
in 1917 (see Lenin¹s book ³Left-Wing² Communism 
. . .23); 
‹‹ b) When uncertainty and confusion, decay and 
disintegration in the enemy¹s camp have reached a 
climax; when the number of deserters and renegades 
from the enemy¹s camp grows by leaps and bounds; 
when the so-called neutral elements, the vast mass of the 
urban and rural petty bourgeoisie, are beginning definitely 
to turn away from the enemy (from the autocracy

J. V. S T A L I N 76 
or the bourgeoisie) and are seeking an alliance with the 
proletariat; when, as a result of all this, the enemy¹s 
organs of administration, together with the organs of 
suppression, cease to function, become paralysed and 
useless, etc., thus leaving the road open for the proletariat 
to exercise its right to seize power; 
‹‹ c) When both these factors (points a and b) coincide 
in time, which, actually, is what usually happens. 
Some people think that it is enough to note the objective 
process of extinction of the class in power in order 
to launch the attack. But that is wrong. In addition to 
this, the subjective conditions necessary for a successful 
attack must have been prepared. It is precisely the task 
of strategy and tactics skilfully and opportunely to make 
the preparation of the subjective conditions for attacks 
fit in with the objective processes of the extinction of 
the power of the ruling class. 
3) Choice of the moment. Correct choice of the moment, 
in so far as the moment to strike is really chosen by the 
Party and not imposed by events, presupposes the existence 
of two conditions: a) ³ripeness of the fruit,² and 
b) some glaring event, action by the government or some 
spontaneous outburst of a local character that can serve 
as a suitable reason, obvious to the broad masses, for 
striking the first blow, for beginning the attack. Failure 
to observe these two conditions may mean that the blow 
will not only fail to serve as the starting point for general 
attacks of increasing scale and intensity upon the 
enemy, will not only fail to grow into a thundering, 
crushing blow (and that is precisely the meaning and 
purpose of the proper choice of the moment), but, on the 
contrary, may degenerate into a ludicrous putsch, which

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
77 
the government, and the enemy generally, will welcome 
and exploit to raise their prestige, and which may become 
a pretext and starting point for wrecking the Party, or 
in any case, for demoralising it. For example, the proposal 
made by a section of the Central Committee to arrest 
the Democratic Conference,24 but rejected by the 
Central Committee because it failed to comply (totally 
failed to comply) with the second requirement (see 
above), was inappropriate from the standpoint of choice 
of the moment. 
In general, care must be taken that the first blow 
(choice of the moment) does not turn into a putsch. To 
prevent this, it is essential that the two conditions indicated 
above are strictly observed. 
4) ³Trial of strength.² Sometimes the Party, having 
made preparations for decisive actions and having accumulated, 
as it thinks, sufficient reserves, considers it 
expedient to undertake a trial action, to test the enemy¹s 
strength and to ascertain whether its own forces are ready 
for action. Such a trial of strength may be undertaken 
by the Party deliberately, by its own choice (the demonstration 
that it was proposed to hold on June 10, 1917, 
but was later called off and replaced by the demonstration 
on June 18), or may be forced upon it by circumstances, 
by premature action by the opposing side, or, in 
general, by some unforeseen event (the Kornilov revolt 
in August 1917 and the Communist Party¹s counteraction 
which served as a splendid trial of strength). A 
³trial of strength² must not be regarded merely as a demonstration, 
like a May Day demonstration; therefore, 
it must not be described merely as a calculation of forces; 
as regards its importance and possible results i t is 
POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS

J. V. S T A L I N 78 
undoubtedly more than an ordinary demonstration, although 
less than an uprising‹it is something between 
a demonstration and an uprising or a general strike. 
Under favourable circumstances it may develop into the 
first blow (choice of the moment), into an uprising (our 
Party¹s action at the end of October); under unfavourable 
circumstances it may put the Party in immediate danger 
of being wrecked (the demonstration of July 3-4, 1917). 
It is therefore most expedient to undertake a trial of 
strength when the ³fruit is ripe,² when the enemy¹s 
camp is sufficiently demoralised, when the Party has 
accumulated a certain number of reserves; briefly: when 
the Party is ready for an offensive, when the Party is 
not daunted by the possibility that circumstances may 
cause the trial of strength to become the first blow and 
then to become a general offensive against the enemy. 
When undertaking a trial of strength the Party must be 
ready for all contingencies. 
5) ³Calculation of forces.² Calculation of forces is 
simply a demonstration which can be undertaken in almost 
any situation (for example, a May Day demonstration, 
with or without a strike). If a calculation of forces 
is not undertaken on the eve of an open upheaval, but 
at a more or less ³peaceful² time, it can end at most in 
a skirmish with the government¹s police or troops, without 
involving heavy casualties for the Party or for the 
enemy. If, however, it is undertaken in the white-hot 
atmosphere of impending upheavals, it may involve the 
Party in a premature decisive collision with the enemy, 
and if the Party is still weak and unready for such collisions, 
the enemy can take advantage of such a ³calculation 
of forces² to crush the proletarian forces (hence

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 79 
the Party¹s repeated appeals in September 1917: ³don¹t 
allow yourselves to be provoked²). Therefore, in applying 
the method of a calculation of forces in the atmosphere 
of an already ripe revolutionary crisis, it is necessary to 
be very careful, and it must be borne in mind that if 
the Party is weak, the enemy can convert such a calculation 
into a weapon with which to defeat the proletariat, 
or at least, to weaken it seriously. And, on the 
other hand, if the Party is ready for action, and the 
enemy¹s ranks are obviously demoralised, then, having 
begun a ³calculation of forces,² the opportunity 
must not be lost to pass on to a ³trial of strength² (assuming 
that the conditions for this are favourable‹ 
³ripeness of fruit,² etc.) and then to launch the general 
assault. 
6) Offensive tactics (tactics of wars of liberation, 
when the proletariat has already taken power). 
7) Tactics of orderly retreat. How skilfully to retreat 
into the interior in face of obviously superior enemy forces 
in order to save if not most of the army, then at least its 
cadres (see Lenin¹s book ³Left-Wing² Communism . . .). 
How we were the last to retreat, for example, during the 
boycott of the Witte-Dubasov Duma. The difference 
between tactics of retreat and ³tactics² of flight (compare 
the Mensheviks). 
8) Defence tactics, as a necessary means of preserving 
cadres and accumulating forces in anticipation of future 
battles. They impose on the Party the duty of taking up 
positions on all fields of the struggle without exception, 
of bringing all kinds of weapon, i.e., all forms of organisation, 
into proper order, not neglecting a single one of 
them, even the seemingly most insignificant, for nobody

J. V. S T A L I N 80 
can tell in advance which field will be the first arena of 
battle, or which form of the movement, or form of organisation, 
will be the starting point and tangible weapon 
of the proletariat when the decisive battles open. In other 
words: in the period of defence and accumulation of 
forces, the Party must make itself fully prepared in anticipation 
of decisive battles. In anticipation of battles. . . . 
But this does not mean that the Party must wait with 
folded arms and become an idle spectator, degenerating 
from a revolutionary party (if it is in the opposition) 
into a wait-and-see party‹no, in such a period it must 
avoid battles, not accept battle, if it has not yet accumulated 
the necessary amount of forces or if the situation 
is unfavourable for it, but it must not miss a single opportunity, 
under favourable conditions, of course, to force 
a battle upon the enemy when that is to the enemy¹s 
disadvantage, to keep the enemy in a constant state of 
tension, step by step to disorganise and demoralise his 
forces, step by step to exercise the proletarian forces in 
battles affecting the everyday interests of the proletariat, 
and in this way increase its own forces. 
Only if this is done can defence be really active d efence 
and the Party preserve all the attributes of a real 
party of action and not of a contemplative, wait-and-see 
party; only then will the Party avoid missing, overlooking, 
the moment for decisive action, avoid being taken 
unawares by events. The case of Kautsky and Co. overlooking 
the moment for the proletarian revolution in 
the West owing to their ³wise² contemplative waiting 
tactics and still ³wiser² passivity is a direct warning. Or 
again: the case of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries 
missing the opportunity to take power owing

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 81 
to their tactics of endless waiting on the questions of 
peace and land should also serve as a warning. On the 
other hand, it is also obvious that the tactics of active 
defence, the tactics of action, must not be abused, for 
that would create the danger of the Communist Party¹s 
tactics of revolutionary action being converted into tactics 
of ³revolutionary² gymnastics, i.e., into tactics that 
lead not to the accumulating the forces of the proletariat 
and to their increased readiness for action, hence, not 
to the acceleration of the revolution, but to the dissipation 
of the proletarian forces, to the deterioration of 
their readiness for action, and hence, to retarding the 
cause of the revolution. 
9) The general principles of communist strategy and 
tactics. There are three such principles: 
a) The adoption, as a basis, of the conclusion, arrived 
at by Marxist theory and confirmed by revolutionary 
practice, that in capitalist countries the proletariat 
is the only completely revolutionary class, which is 
interested in the complete emancipation of mankind 
from capitalism and whose mission it is, therefore, to 
be the leader of all the oppressed and exploited masses 
in the struggle to overthrow capitalism. Consequently, 
all work must be directed towards the establishment of 
the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
b) The adoption, as a basis, of the conclusion, arrived 
at by Marxist theory and confirmed by revolutionary 
practice, that the strategy and tactics of the Communist 
Party of any country can be correct only if they are not 
confined to the interests of ³their own² country, ³their 
own² fatherland, ³their own² proletariat, but, on the 
contrary, if, while taking into account the conditions

J. V. S T A L I N 82 
and situation in their own country, they make the interests 
of the international proletariat, the interests of 
the revolution in other countries, the corner-stone, i.e., 
if, in essence, in spirit, they are internationalist, if they 
do ³the utmost possible in one (their own) country for 
the development, support and awakening of the revolution 
in all countries² (see Lenin¹s book The Proletarian 
Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky25). 
c) The adoption, as a starting point, of the repudiation 
of all doctrinairism (Right and Left) when changing 
strategy and tactics, when working out new strategic 
plans and tactical lines (Kautsky, Axelrod, Bogdanov, 
Bukharin), repudiation of the contemplative method and 
the method of quoting texts and drawing historical parallels, 
artificial plans and lifeless formulas (Axelrod, Plekhanov); 
recognition that it is necessary to stand by the 
point of view of Marxism, not to ³lie down on it,² that 
it is necessary to ³change² the world, not ³merely to 
interpret² it, that it is necessary to lead the proletariat 
and be the conscious expression of the unconscious process, 
and not ³contemplate the proletariat¹s rear² and 
drag at the tail of events (see Lenin¹s ³Spontaneity and 
Consciousness²26 and the well-known passage in Marx¹s 
Communist Manifesto27 to the effect that the Communists 
are the most far-sighted and advanced section of the 
proletariat). 
Illustrate each of these principles with facts from 
the revolutionary movement in Russia and in the West, 
especially the second principle, and the third. 
10) Tasks: 
a) To win the vanguard of the proletariat to the side 
of communism (i.e., build up cadres, create a Communist

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 83 
Party, work out the programme, the principles of tactics). 
Propaganda as the chief form of activity. 
b) To win the broad masses of the workers and of the 
toilers generally to the side of the vanguard (to bring the 
masses up to the fighting positions). Chief form of activity‹
practical action by the masses as a prelude to 
decisive battles. 
11) Rules: 
a) Master all forms of organisation of the proletariat 
without exception and all forms (fields) of the movement, 
of the struggle. (Forms of the movement: parliamentary 
and extra-parliamentary, legal and illegal.) 
b) Learn to adapt oneself to rapid changes from some 
forms of the movement to others, or to supplement some 
forms with others; learn to combine legal forms with illegal, 
parliamentary with extra-parliamentary forms (example: 
the Bolsheviks¹ rapid transition from legal to illegal 
forms in July 1917; combination of the extra-parliamentary 
movement with action in the Duma during the 
Lena events). 
12) The Communist Party¹s strategy and tactics before 
and after taking power. Four specific features. 
a) The most important feature of the situation that 
arose in Europe in general, and in Russia in particular, 
after the October Revolution was the breach of the international 
social front (as a result of the victory over the 
Russian bourgeoisie) in the region of Russia carried out 
by the Russian proletariat (rupture with imperialism, 
publication of the secret treaties, civil war instead of 
imperialist war, the call to the troops to fraternise, the 
call to the workers to rise against their governments). 
That breach marked a turn in world history, for it directly

J. V. S T A L I N 84 
menaced the entire edifice of international imperialism 
and radically changed the relation of the contending 
forces in the West in favour of the working class of Europe. 
This meant that the Russian proletariat and its Party 
changed from a national into an international force, and 
their former task of overthrowing their own national 
bourgeoisie was superseded by the new task of overthrowing 
the international bourgeoisie. Since the international 
bourgeoisie, sensing mortal danger, set itself the immediate 
task of closing the Russian breach and concentrated 
its unengaged forces (reserves) against Soviet Russia, 
the latter could not, in her turn, refrain from concentrating 
all her forces for defence, and was obliged to draw the 
main blow of the international bourgeoisie upon herself. 
All this greatly facilitated the struggle the Western 
proletarians were waging against their own bourgeoisie 
and increased tenfold their sympathy with the Russian 
proletariat as the vanguard fighter of the international 
proletariat. 
Thus, the accomplishment of the task of overthrowing 
the bourgeoisie in one country led to the new task 
of fighting on an international scale, of fighting on a 
different plane‹to a fight waged by the proletarian 
state against hostile capitalist states; and the Russian 
proletariat, which hitherto had been one of the detachments 
of the international proletariat, henceforth became 
the advanced detachment, the vanguard, of the international 
proletariat. 
Thus, the task of unleashing revolution in the West 
in order to make it easier for her, i.e., Russia, to complete 
her revolution, was transformed from a wish into 
a purely practical task of the day. This change in rela

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 85 
tions (particularly in international relations) brought 
about by October is e n t i r e l y due to October. The 
February Revolution did not affect international relations 
in the least. 
b) The second important feature of the situation that 
arose in Russia after October was the change in the position 
both of the proletariat and its Party within Russia. 
Formerly, before October, the proletariat¹s main concern 
was to organise all the fighting forces for overthrowing 
the bourgeoisie, i.e., its task was chiefly of a critical and 
destructive character. Now, after October, when the 
bourgeoisie is no longer in power, and the state has 
become proletarian, the old task has dropped out; its 
place has been taken by the new task of organising all 
the working people of Russia (the peasants, artisans, handicraftsmen, 
intellectuals, the backward nationalities in 
the R.S.F.S.R.) for building the new Soviet Russia, her 
economic and military organisations, on the one hand, 
and for crushing the resistance of the overthrown, but not 
yet completely crushed, bourgeoisie, on the other hand.* 
c) Corresponding to the change in the proletariat¹s 
position within Russia, and in conformity with the new 
task, a change has taken place in the policy of the proletariat 
in relation to the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois groups 
and strata of the population of Russia. Formerly (on 
the eve of the overthrow of the bourgeoisie) the proletariat 
refused to enter into individual agreements with 
* Correspondingly, some of the old forms of the movement 
have dropped out, such as strikes, uprisings, etc., and, correspondingly, 
the character and forms (functions) of the working-class 
organisations (the Party, Soviets, trade unions, co-operatives, 
cultural and educational institutions) have also changed.

J. V. S T A L I N 86 
bourgeois groups, for such a policy would have strengthened 
the bourgeoisie, which was in power. Now, however, 
the proletariat is in favour of individual agreements, 
for they strengthen its power, cause disintegration among 
the bourgeoisie, help the proletariat to tame, to assimilate, 
individual groups of the bourgeoisie. The difference 
between ³reformism² and the policy of individual 
agreements (the former absolutely rejects the method of 
revolutionary action, the latter does not, and when revolutionaries 
do employ it, they base it on the revolutionary 
method; the former is narrower, the latter is wider in 
scope). (See ³reformism² and ³agreements policy.²) 
d) Corresponding to the colossal growth of the strength 
and resources of the proletariat and the Communist 
Party, the scope of the Communist Party¹s strategic activities 
increased. Formerly the strategy of the Communist 
Party was limited to the drawing up of the strategic 
plan, to manoeuvring between the different forms of the 
movement and of proletarian organisations, and also 
between the different demands of the movement (slogans), 
advancing some, changing others, employing the 
scanty reserves in the shape of the contradictions between 
the different classes. As a rule, the scope and possibility 
of employing these reserves were restricted to narrow 
limits owing to the weakness of the Party. Now, however, 
after October, firstly, the reserves have grown (contradictions 
between the social groups in Russia, contradictions 
between classes and nationalities in the surrounding 
states, contradictions between the surrounding 
states, the growing socialist revolution in the West, the 
growing revolutionary movement in the East and in 
the colonies generally, etc.); secondly, the means and

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 87 
possibilities of manoeuvring have increased (the old means 
have been supplemented with new ones in the shape, for 
example, of diplomatic activity, establishment of more 
effective connections both with the Western socialist 
movement and with the Eastern revolutionary movement); 
thirdly, new and wider possibilities have arisen for employing 
reserves owing to the increase of the strength and resources 
of the proletariat which, in Russia, has become 
the dominant political force, possessing its own armed 
forces, and in the international field has become the vanguard 
of the world revolutionary movement. 
13) Special: a) the question of the tempo of the movement 
and its role in determining strategy and tactics; 
b) the question of reformism, of the policy of agreements, 
and the relation between them. 
14) ³R e f o r m i s m² (³compromise²), ³p o l i c y 
o f a g r e e m e n t s² and ³i n d i v i d u a l a g r e em 
e n t s² are t h r e e d i f f e r e n t t h i n g s (write 
about each separately). A g r e e m e n t s as concluded 
by the Mensheviks are unacceptable because they are 
based on reformism, i.e., on the repudiation of revolutionary 
action, whereas agreements as concluded by the Bolsheviks 
are based on the requirements of revolutionary 
action. For that very reason agreements as concluded by 
the Mensheviks become converted into a system, into a 
policy of agreements, whereas the Bolsheviks are only for 
individual, concrete agreements, and do not make them 
into a special policy of agreements. 
15) Three periods in the development of the Communist 
Party of Russia: 
a) the period of the formation of the vanguard (i.e., 
the party) of the proletariat, the period of mustering the

J. V. S T A L I N 88 
Party¹s cadres (in this period the Party was weak; it had 
a programme and general principles of tactics, but as a 
party of mass action it was weak); 
b) the period of revolutionary mass struggle under the 
leadership of the Communist Party. In this period the 
Party was transformed from an organisation for mass 
agitation into an organisation for mass action; the period 
of preparation was superseded by the period of revolutionary 
action; 
c) the period after taking power, after the Communist 
Party had become the government party. 
16) The political s t r e n g t h o f t h e R u s - 
s i a n p r o l e t a r i a n r e v o l u t i o n lies in that 
the peasant agrarian revolution (overthrow of feudalism) 
took place here under the leadership of the proletariat 
(and not of the bourgeoisie), and, as a consequence of 
this, the bourgeois-democratic revolution served as the 
prologue of the proletarian revolution; in that the connection 
between the labouring elements of the peasantry 
and the proletariat, and the support the latter rendered 
the former, were not only ensured politically, but consolidated 
organisationally in the Soviets, and this aroused 
for the proletariat the sympathy of the vast majority 
of the population (and that is why i t d o e s n o t 
m a t t e r if the proletariat itself does not constitute the 
majority in the country). 
T h e w e a k n e s s o f t h e p r o l e t a r i a n 
r e v o l u t i o n s i n E u r o p e (the continent) lies 
in that there the proletariat lacks t h i s connection with 
and t h i s support of the countryside; there, the peasants 
were emancipated from feudalism under the leadership 
of the bourgeoisie and not of the proletariat, which

POLITICAL STRATEGY AND TACTICS 89 
was weak at the time), and this, combined with the indifference 
Social-Democracy displayed towards the interests 
of the countryside, for a long time ensured the bourgeoisie 
the sympathy of the majority of the peasants.*

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF COMMUNISM 
IN GEORGIA AND TRANSCAUCASIA 
Report to a General Meeting of the Tiflis 
Organisation of the Communist Party of Georgia28 
July 6, 1921 
Comrades, the committee of your organisation has 
instructed me to deliver a report to you on the immediate 
tasks of communism in Georgia. 
The immediate tasks of communism are questions of 
tactics. But to be able to determine a party¹s tactics, 
particularly the tactics of a government party, it is 
first of all necessary to weigh up the general situation 
in which the party finds itself, which it must not ignore. 
What, then, is this situation? 
It scarcely needs proof that with the outbreak of the 
Civil War the world split up into two opposite camps, 
the imperialist camp headed by the Entente, and the socialist 
camp headed by Soviet Russia; that in the first 
camp are all kinds of capitalist, ³democratic² and Menshevik 
states, and in the second are the Soviet states, 
including Georgia. The principal feature of the situation 
in which the Soviet countries find themselves today is 
that the period of armed struggle between the two abovementioned 
camps ended with a more or less prolonged 
armistice between them; that the period of war has been 
superseded by a period of peaceful economic construction 
of the Soviet republics. Before, in the war period, 
so to speak, the Soviet republics operated under the general

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF COMMUNISM 91 
slogan ³All for the war,² for the Soviet republics were 
a beleaguered camp, blockaded by the imperialist states. 
In that period, the Communist Party devoted all its 
energy to throwing all active forces into the work of 
building the Red Army, into strengthening the front of 
the armed struggle against imperialism. Needless to 
say, in that period the Party was unable to concentrate 
its attention on economic construction. It may be said 
without exaggeration that in that period the economics 
of the Soviet countries were confined to the development 
of war industry and to the maintenance, as best they 
could, of certain branches of the national economy, also 
connected with the war. This, indeed, explains the economic 
ruin that we inherited from the war period of the 
Soviet states. 
Now that we have entered the new period of economic 
construction, now that we have passed from war to 
peaceful labour, the old slogan ³All for the war² is naturally 
replaced by a new slogan ³All for the national 
economy.² This new period imposes on the Communists 
the duty of throwing all forces on to the economic front, 
into industry, agriculture, food supply, the co-operatives, 
transport, etc. For if we fail to do this we shall be 
unable to overcome economic ruin. 
Whereas the war period produced Communists of the 
military type‹supply officers, mobilisation officers, operations 
officers, and so forth, in the new period, the period 
of economic construction, the Communist Party 
must, in drawing the broad masses into the task of economic 
revival, train a new type of Communist, a communist 
business-manager‹managers of industry, agriculture, 
transport, the co-operatives, and so forth.

J. V. S T A L I N 92 
But, while developing the work of economic construction, 
Communists must not ignore two very important 
circumstances that we have inherited from the past. 
These circumstances are: firstly, the existence of highly 
industrialised bourgeois states surrounding the Soviet 
countries; secondly, the existence of a numerous peasant 
petty bourgeoisie within the Soviet states. 
The point is that by the will of history the Soviet 
power has triumphed, not in the more highly developed 
countries, but in those relatively less developed in a 
capitalist respect. History has shown that it is much 
easier to overthrow the bourgeoisie in countries like 
Russia, where capitalism is relatively young, where the 
proletariat is strong and concentrated and the national 
bourgeoisie is weak, than in the classical countries 
of capitalism like Germany, Britain and France, where 
capitalism has existed for several centuries, and where 
the bourgeoisie has succeeded in becoming a powerful 
force that controls the whole of social life. 
When the proletarian dictatorship is established in 
countries like Germany and Britain, it will, no doubt, 
be easier there to develop and complete the socialist 
revolution, i.e., it will be easier to organise socialist 
economy there, for industry is more developed there, 
it is more highly equipped technically, and the proletariat 
is relatively more numerous than in the present 
Soviet countries. For the time being, however, we are 
faced with the fact that, on the one hand, the proletarian 
dictatorship has been established in countries that 
are less developed industrially and have a numerous 
class of small commodity producers (peasants) and, on 
the other hand, that the bourgeois dictatorship exists

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF COMMUNISM 93 
in the countries that are more highly developed industrially 
and have a numerous proletariat. It would be unwise, 
thoughtless, to ignore this fact. 
Since the Soviet countries have abundant sources 
of raw materials and fuel, while the industrially developed 
bourgeois countries are suffering from a shortage 
of these, individual capitalist groups in bourgeois states 
are undoubtedly interested in concluding agreements 
with the Soviet states with a view to exploiting these 
sources of raw materials and fuel on definite terms. 
On the other hand, since the small producer class in the 
Soviet states (the peasantry) needs manufactured goods 
(textiles, agricultural machines), it is also undoubtedly 
interested in concluding an agreement with its proletarian 
government with a view to receiving such goods 
on a barter basis (in exchange for agricultural produce). 
The Soviet Government, in its turn, is also interested 
in concluding temporary agreements both with individual 
capitalist groups in foreign countries, and with 
the class of small commodity producers in its own country, 
for such agreements will undoubtedly accelerate and facilitate 
the restoration of the productive forces that were 
destroyed by the war, and the development of electrification, 
the technical-industrial basis of the future 
socialist economy. 
These circumstances dictate to the Communists of 
the Soviet states a policy of concluding temporary agreements 
both with individual capitalist groups in the 
West (with a view to exploiting their capital and technical 
forces), and with the petty bourgeoisie at home (with 
a view to obtaining the necessary raw materials and 
food products).

J. V. S T A L I N 94 
Some people may say that these tactics of concluding 
agreements with the bourgeoisie smack of Menshevism, 
for the Mensheviks in their activities employ the tactics 
of agreements with the bourgeoisie. But that is not correct. 
There is a wide gulf between the tactics of concluding 
agreements with individual bourgeois groups, now proposed 
by the Communists, and the Menshevik tactics 
of concluding agreements with the bourgeoisie. The Mensheviks 
usually propose the conclusion of agreements 
with the bourgeoisie when the capitalists are in power, 
when, in order to strengthen their power and to corrupt 
the proletariat, the capitalists in power are not averse 
from handing down from above some ³reforms,² small 
concessions to individual groups of the proletariat. Such 
agreements are harmful to the proletariat and profitable 
to the bourgeoisie, for they do not weaken but strengthen 
the power of the bourgeoisie, cause dissension among the 
proletariat and split its ranks. That is precisely why the 
Bolsheviks always opposed, and always will oppose, the 
Menshevik tactics of concluding agreements with the 
bourgeoisie when the latter is in power. That is precisely 
why the Bolsheviks regard the Mensheviks as vehicles of 
bourgeois influence on the proletariat. 
In contrast to the Menshevik tactics, however, the 
tactics of concluding agreements proposed by the Bolsheviks 
are of an altogether different character, for they 
presuppose an entirely different situation, one in which 
the proletariat and not the bourgeoisie is in power; 
and the inevitable result of the conclusion of agreements 
between individual bourgeois groups and the proletarian 
government must be the strengthening of proletarian 
power, on the one hand, and the disintegration of the

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF COMMUNISM 95 
bourgeoisie, the taming of some of its groups, on the 
other. It is only necessary that the proletariat should 
keep a tight hold on the power it has won and make 
skilful use of the resources and knowledge of these bourgeois 
groups for the economic revival of the country. 
You see that these tactics and the Menshevik tactics 
are as far apart as heaven and earth. 
Thus, to throw all active forces on to the economic 
front and, by means of agreements with individual bourgeois 
groups, to make use of the latter¹s resources, knowledge 
and organising skill in the interests of the economic 
revival of the country‹such is the first immediate task 
dictated by the general situation to the Communists 
in Soviet countries, including the Communists in Georgia. 
It is not, however, sufficient to weigh up the general 
situation in order to be able to determine the tactics 
of individual Soviet countries, in this case, the tactics of 
Soviet Georgia. To be able to determine the tactics 
the Communists in each Soviet country must pursue, 
it is also necessary to take into account the particular, 
concrete conditions of existence of each country. What 
are the particular, concrete conditions of existence of 
Soviet Georgia, in which the Communist Party of Georgia 
has to operate? 
A number of facts that characterise these conditions 
can be established beyond doubt. 
First, it is beyond doubt that in view of the utter 
hostility of the capitalist states towards the Soviet countries, 
the totally isolated existence of Soviet Georgia, 
or of any other Soviet country, is inconceivable both 
from the military and from the economic point of view. 
The mutual economic and military support of the Soviet

J. V. S T A L I N 96 
states is a condition without which the development 
of these states is inconceivable. 
Secondly, it is obvious that Georgia, which is suffering 
from a shortage of food products, needs Russian 
grain and cannot do without it. 
Thirdly, Georgia, having no liquid fuel, obviously 
needs the oil products of Azerbaijan, and cannot do 
without them, in order to maintain her transport and industry. 
Fourthly, it is also beyond doubt that, suffering from 
a shortage of goods for export, Georgia needs assistance 
from Russia in the form of gold for covering 
the deficit in the balance of trade. 
Lastly, i t is impossible to ignore the distinctive 
conditions created by the national composition of the 
population of Georgia: a large percentage of this population 
consists of Armenians, and in Tiflis, the capital of 
Georgia, they constitute as much as half the population. 
This, undoubtedly, under any form of government and 
in particular under the Soviet regime, makes it the duty 
of Georgia to maintain absolute peace and fraternal cooperation 
both with the Armenians in Georgia and with 
Armenia. 
It scarcely needs proof that these, and many other 
concrete conditions of a similar kind, impose on Soviet 
Georgia, as well as upon Soviet Armenia and Azerbaijan, 
the duty of in some way uniting their economic activities, 
of uniting their economic efforts, in order, say, to 
improve transport, for joint action in foreign markets, 
organisation of land reclamation schemes (irrigation, 
drainage), etc. I shall not dwell on the necessity of 
mutual support and contact between the Transcaucasian

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF COMMUNISM 97 
independent Soviet republics, and between them and Soviet 
Russia, in the event of our having to defend ourselves 
against attacks from outside. All this is obvious 
and indisputable. And if I mention these commonplace 
truths it is only because certain circumstances have 
arisen during the past two or three years which hinder 
such union, which threaten to frustrate attempts at such 
union. I am referring to nationalism‹Georgian, Armenian 
and Azerbaijanian‹which has shockingly increased 
in the Transcaucasian republics during the past few 
years and is an obstacle to joint effort. 
I remember the years 1905-17, when complete fraternal 
solidarity was to be observed among the workers 
and among the labouring population of the Transcaucasian 
nationalities in general, when fraternal ties bound 
the Armenian, Georgian, Azerbaijanian and Russian 
workers into one socialist family. Now, upon my arrival 
in Tiflis, I have been astounded by the absence of the 
former solidarity between the workers of the nationalities 
of Transcaucasia. Nationalism has developed among the 
workers and peasants, a feeling of distrust of their comrades 
of other nationalities has grown strong: anti-Armenian, 
anti-Tatar, anti-Georgian, anti-Russian and every 
other sort of nationalism is now rife. The old ties of 
fraternal confidence are severed, or at least greatly weakened. 
Evidently, the three years of existence of nationalist 
governments in Georgia (Mensheviks), in Azerbaijan (Mussavatists29) 
and in Armenia (Dashnaks30) have left their 
mark. By pursuing their nationalist policy, by working 
among the toilers in a spirit of aggressive nationalism, 
these nationalist governments finally brought matters 
to the point where each of these small countries found

J. V. S T A L I N 98 
itself surrounded by a hostile nationalist atmosphere, 
which deprived Georgia and Armenia of Russian grain and 
Azerbaijanian oil, and Azerbaijan and Russia of goods 
passing through Batum‹not to speak of armed clashes 
(Georgian-Armenian war) and massacres (Armenian-Tatar), 
as the natural results of the nationalist policy. No 
wonder that in this poisonous nationalist atmosphere 
the old international ties have been severed and the 
minds of the workers poisoned by nationalism. And since 
the survivals of this nationalism have not yet been eliminated 
among the workers, this circumstance (nationalism) 
is the greatest obstacle to uniting the economic 
(and military) efforts of the Transcaucasian Soviet Republics. 
Well, I have said already that without such 
union, the economic progress of the Transcaucasian 
Soviet Republics, and especially of Soviet Georgia, is 
inconceivable. Hence the immediate task of the Communists 
of Georgia is to wage a ruthless struggle against 
nationalism, to restore the old fraternal international 
bonds that existed before the nationalist Menshevik government 
came on the scene, and thus to create that 
healthy atmosphere of mutual confidence which is necessary 
for uniting the economic efforts of the Transcaucasian 
Soviet Republics and for the economic revival 
of Georgia. 
This does not mean, of course, that there ought no 
longer to be an independent Georgia, or an independent 
Azerbaijan, and so forth. In my opinion, the draft scheme 
that is circulating among some comrades for restoring 
the old gubernias (Tiflis, Baku, Erivan), to be headed 
by a single Transcaucasian government, is a utopia, and 
a reactionary utopia at that; for this scheme is undoubt

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF COMMUNISM 99 
edly prompted by the desire to turn back the wheel of 
history. To restore the old gubernias and to dissolve 
the national governments in Georgia, Azerbaijan and 
Armenia would be tantamount to restoring landlordism 
and liquidating the gains of the revolution. This has 
nothing in common with communism. It is precisely in 
order to dispel the atmosphere of mutual distrust, and 
to restore the bonds of fraternity between the workers 
of the nationalities of Transcaucasia and Russia, that 
the independence both of Georgia and of Azerbaijan and 
Armenia must be preserved. This does not preclude, but, 
on the contrary, presupposes the necessity of mutual 
economic and other support, and also the necessity of 
uniting the economic efforts of the independent Soviet 
republics on the basis of voluntary agreement, on the 
basis of a convention. 
According to information I have received, it was 
recently decided in Moscow to render Georgia, Armenia 
and Azerbaijan some small assistance in the shape of 
a loan of 6,500,000 rubles in gold. Furthermore, I have 
learned that Georgia and Armenia are receiving oil products 
from Azerbaijan free of charge, something that is 
inconceivable in the life of bourgeois states, even such 
as are united by the notorious ³Entente Cordiale.²31 
It scarcely needs proof that these and similar acts do 
not weaken, but strengthen the independence of these 
states. 
Thus, to eliminate nationalist survivals, to cauterise 
them with red-hot irons, and to create a healthy atmosphere 
of mutual confidence among the toilers of 
the Transcaucasian nationalities in order to facilitate 
and hasten the uniting of the economic efforts of the

J. V. S T A L I N 100 
Transcaucasian Soviet Republics (without which the economic 
revival of Soviet Georgia is inconceivable), while 
preserving the independence of Soviet Georgia‹such is 
the second immediate task dictated to the Communists 
of Georgia by the concrete conditions of existence of 
that country. 
Lastly, the third immediate task, equally important 
and equally necessary, is to preserve the purity, 
staunchness and flexibility of the Communist Party of 
Georgia. 
Comrades, you must remember that our Party is the 
government party, that often whole groups of unreliable 
careerist elements, alien to the proletarian spirit, get 
into or try to get into, the Party and carry into it the 
spirit of disintegration and conservatism. It is the vital 
task of the Communists to guard the Party against such 
elements. We must remember once and for all that the 
strength and weight of a party, and especially of the 
Communist Party, do not depend so much on the quantity 
of members as on their quality, on their staunchness 
and devotion to the cause of the proletariat. The Russian 
Communist Party has all-in-all 700,000 members. I can 
assure you, comrades, that it could raise its membership 
to 7,000,000 if it wished to do so, and if it did not know 
that 700,000 staunch Communists constitute a much 
stronger force than 7,000,000 unwanted and good-fornothing 
fellow-travellers. If Russia has withstood the 
onslaught of world imperialism, if she has achieved a 
number of most important successes on the external 
fronts, and if in the course of two or three years she has 
developed into a force that is shaking the foundations of 
world imperialism, this is due, among other things, to the

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF COMMUNISM 101 
existence of the united Communist Party, forged out 
of hard steel and tempered in battle, which has never 
gone out for quantity of members, but which has made 
its first concern the improvement of their quality. Lassalle 
was right when he said that the party becomes strong 
by purging itself of dross. On the other hand, there can 
be no doubt that the reason why the German Social- 
Democratic Party, for example, the biggest Social-Democratic 
Party in the world, proved to be a plaything in 
the hands of imperialism during the imperialist war and 
collapsed like a colossus with feet of clay after the war 
was that for years it had devoted itself to enlarging its 
organisations by admitting all sorts of petty-bourgeois 
trash, which killed its living spirit. 
Thus, to preserve the staunchness and purity of its 
ranks, not to go out for quantity of Party members, 
systematically to improve the quality of the Party membership, 
to guard itself against an influx of intellectual, 
petty-bourgeois nationalist elements‹such is the 
third and last immediate task of the Communist Party 
of Georgia. 
I am finishing my report, comrades. I pass now to 
the conclusions: 
1) Develop all-round economic construction work, 
concentrating all your forces on this work and utilising 
in it the forces and resources both of capitalist groups 
in the West and of petty-bourgeois groups at home. 
2) Crush the hydra of nationalism and create a healthy 
atmosphere of internationalism in order to facilitate 
the union of the economic efforts of the Transcaucasian 
Soviet Republics, while preserving their independence.

J. V. S T A L I N 102 
3) Guard the Party against an influx of petty-bourgeois 
elements and preserve its staunchness and flexibility, 
systematically improving the quality of its 
membership. 
Such are the three principal immediate tasks of 
the Communist Party of Georgia. 
Only by carrying out these tasks will the Communist 
Party of Georgia be able to keep a tight hold on the 
helm and defeat economic ruin. (Applause.)

THE PARTY BEFORE AND AFTER 
TAKING POWER 
Three periods must be noted in the development of 
our Party. 
The first period was the period of formation, of the 
creation of our Party. It embraces the interval of time 
approximately from the foundation of Iskra32 to the 
Third Party Congress inclusively (end of 1900 to beginning 
of 1905). 
In this period the Party, as a driving force, was 
weak. It was weak not only because it itself was young, 
but also because the working-class movement as a whole 
was young and because the revolutionary situation, the 
revolutionary movement, was lacking, or little developed, 
particularly in the initial stages of this period (the 
peasantry was silent or did not go beyond sullen murmuring; 
the workers conducted only partial economic strikes 
or political strikes covering a whole town; the forms 
of the movement were of an underground or semi-legal 
character; the forms of working-class organisation were 
also mainly of an underground character). 
The Party¹s strategy‹since strategy presupposes 
the existence of reserves and the possibility of manoeuvring 
with them‹was necessarily narrow and restricted. 
The Party confined itself to mapping the movement¹s

J. V. S T A L I N 104 
strategic plan, i . e . , the route that the movement 
should take; and the Party¹s reserves‹the contradictions 
within the camp of the enemies inside and outside of 
Russia‹remained unused, or almost unused, owing to 
the weakness of the Party. 
The Party ¹s tactics, since tactics presuppose the 
utilisation of all forms of the movement, forms of proletarian 
organisation, their combination and mutual 
supplementation, etc., with the object of winning the 
masses and ensuring strategic success, were also necessarily 
narrow and without scope. 
In this period the Party focussed its attention and 
care upon the Party itself, upon its own existence and 
preservation. At this stage it regarded itself as a kind 
of self-sufficing force. That was natural: tsarism¹s fierce 
attacks upon the Party, and the Mensheviks¹ efforts 
to blow it up from within and to replace the Party cadres 
with an amorphous, non-Party body (recall the Mensheviks¹ 
campaign for a labour congress launched in connection 
with Axelrod¹s notorious pamphlet A People¹s Duma 
and a Labour Congress, 1905), threatened the Party¹s 
very existence and, as a consequence, the question of 
preserving the Party acquired paramount importance 
in this period. 
The principal task of communism in Russia in that 
period was to recruit into the Party the best elements 
of the working class, those who were most active and most 
devoted to the cause of the proletariat; to form the ranks 
of the proletarian party and to put it firmly on its feet. 
Comrade Lenin formulates this task as follows: ³to win 
the vanguard of the proletariat to the side of communism² 
(see ³Left-Wing² Communism . . .33).

THE PARTY BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING POWER 105 
The second period was the period of winning the broad 
masses of the workers and peasants to the side of the Party, 
to the side of the vanguard of the proletariat. It 
embraces the interval of time approximately from October 
1905 to October 1917. 
In this period the situation was much more complex 
and rich in events than in the preceding one. The defeats 
tsarism sustained on the battlefield in Manchuria and 
the revolution of October 1905, on the one hand, the termination 
of the Russo-Japanese war, the triumph of the 
counter-revolution and the liquidation of the gains of 
the revolution, on the other, and thirdly, the imperialist 
war, the revolution of February 1917 and the famous 
³dual power²‹all these events stirred up all classes in 
Russia and pushed them into the political arena one after 
the other, strengthened the Communist Party and awakened 
the broad masses of the peasants to political life. 
The proletarian movement was enriched by such 
powerful forms as the general political strike and armed 
uprising. 
The peasant movement was enriched by the boycott 
of the landlords (³smoking² the landlords out of their 
country seats) which developed into insurrection. 
The activities of the Party and of other revolutionary 
organisations were invigorated by the mastery of 
such forms of work as the extra-parliamentary, legal, 
open form. 
Working-class organisation was enriched not only 
by a tried and important form like the trade unions, but 
also by such a powerful form of working-class organisation 
as the Soviets of Workers¹ Deputies, a form unprecedented 
in history.

J. V. S T A L I N 106 
The peasants followed in the footsteps of the working 
class and set up Soviets of Peasants¹ Deputies. 
The Party¹s reserves were also enriched. It became 
clear in the course of the struggle that the peasantry 
could and would constitute an inexhaustible reserve for 
the proletariat and its party. It also became clear that 
the proletariat and its party would play the leading role 
in overthrowing the rule of capital. 
In this period the Party was by no means as weak as 
it was in the preceding one; as a driving force, it became 
a most important factor. It could now no longer be a 
self-sufficing force, for its existence and development 
were now definitely assured; it changed from a self-sufficing 
force into an instrument for winning the masses of 
the workers and peasants, into an instrument for 
leading the masses in overthrowing the rule of capital. 
In this period the Party¹s strategy acquired wide 
scope; it was directed primarily to gaining and utilising 
the peasantry as a reserve, and it achieved important 
success in this work. 
The Party¹s tactics also acquired wide scope as a 
result of the enrichment of the movement of the masses, 
of their organisation, and of the activities of the Party 
and other revolutionary organisations, by new forms 
which had previously been absent. 
The Party¹s principal task in this period was to 
win the vast masses to the side of the proletarian vanguard, 
to the side of the Party, for the purpose of overthrowing 
the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, for the purpose 
of seizing power. The Party now no longer focussed 
its attention upon itself, but upon the vast masses of 
the people. Comrade Lenin formulates this task as fol

THE PARTY BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING POWER 107 
lows: ³disposition of the vast masses² on the social front 
in such a way as to ensure victory ³in the forthcoming 
decisive battles² (see the above-mentioned pamphlet by 
Comrade Lenin). 
Such are the characteristic features of the first two 
periods in the development of our Party. 
The difference between the first and the second period 
is undoubtedly great. But there is also something 
in common between them. Both in the first and in the 
second period the Party was nine-tenths, if not entirely, 
a national force, effective only for and within Russia 
(one of the detachments of the international organised 
proletariat). That is the first point. The second point 
is that both in the first and in the second period the Russian 
Communist Party was a party of upheaval, the 
party of revolution within Russia, hence in these periods 
the elements of criticism and destruction of the old order 
predominated in its work. 
An entirely different picture is presented by the 
third period, the one we are in now. 
The third period is the period of taking and holding 
power with the object, on the one hand, of drawing all the 
working people of Russia into the work of building socialist 
economy and the Red Army, and, on the other 
hand, of applying all forces and resources for rendering 
assistance to the international proletariat in its struggle 
to overthrow capital. This period embraces the interval 
of time from October 1917 to the present day. 
The fact that the proletariat in Russia has taken 
power has created a very distinctive situation, both internationally 
and within Russia, such as the world has 
never seen before.

J. V. S T A L I N 108 
To begin with, October 1917 marked a breach in the 
world social front and created a turn in the whole of 
world history. Picture to yourselves the boundless social 
front, stretching from the backward colonies to advanced 
America, and then the immense breach forced 
in this front by the Russian detachment of the international 
proletariat, a breach that menaces the existence 
of imperialism, that has upset all the plans of the imperialist 
sharks and has greatly, radically, eased the 
task of the international proletariat in its struggle against 
capital‹such is the historical significance of October 
1917. From that moment our Party was transformed from 
a national force into a predominantly international force, 
and the Russian proletariat was transformed from a 
backward detachment of the international proletariat 
into its vanguard. Henceforth, the tasks of the international 
proletariat are to widen the Russian breach, to 
help the vanguard, which has pushed forward, to prevent 
the enemies from surrounding the brave vanguard and 
cutting it off from its base. The task of international 
imperialism, on the contrary, is to close the Russian 
breach, to close it without fail. That is why our Party, 
if it wants to retain power, pledges itself to do ³the utmost 
possible in one (its own‹J. St.) country for the 
development, support and awakening of the revolution 
in all countries² (see Lenin¹s book The Proletarian Revolution 
and the Renegade Kautsky34). That is why our 
Party, since October 1917, has been transformed from 
a national into an international force, into the Party of 
revolution on an international scale. 
An equally radical change has taken place in the 
Party¹s position within the country as a result of October

THE PARTY BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING POWER 109 
1917. In the preceding periods the Party was an instrument 
for the destruction of the old order, for overthrowing 
capital in Russia. Now, on the contrary, in the third 
period, it has been transformed from a party of revolution 
within Russia into a party of construction, into a 
party for the creation of new forms of economy. In the 
past it recruited the best forces of the workers for the 
purpose of storming the old order; now it is recruiting 
them for the purpose of organising the food supply, transport 
and the basic industries. In the past it rallied the 
revolutionary elements of the peasantry for the purpose 
of overthrowing the landlords; now it is recruiting them 
for the purpose of improving agriculture, of consolidating 
the alliance between the labouring elements of the peasantry 
and the proletariat which is in power. In the past 
it recruited the best elements of the belated nationalities 
for the struggle against capital; now it is recruiting them 
for the purpose of building the life of the labouring elements 
of these nationalities on the basis of co-operation 
with the Russian proletariat. In the past it destroyed 
the army, the old militarist army; now it must build 
up a new, a workers¹ and peasants¹ army, which is needed 
to protect the gains of the revolution from external 
enemies. 
From a party of revolution within Russia, the Russian 
Communist Party has been transformed into a party 
of peaceful construction. That is why it has removed 
from the arsenal of the proletariat such forms of struggle 
as strikes and insurrection, which are now unnecessary 
in Russia. 
In the past we could dispense with experts in military 
and economic affairs, for at that time the Party¹s

J. V. S T A L I N 110 
activity was mainly critical, and it is easy to criticise. . . . 
Now, the Party cannot dispense with experts; in addition 
to utilising the old specialists it must train its own 
experts: mobilisation, supply and operations officers (for 
the army), food officials, agricultural experts, railway 
managers, co-operators, experts in industry and foreign 
trade (in the economic sphere). Without this we shall 
be unable to build. 
A change has also taken place in the Party¹s position 
in that its forces and resources, its reserves, have 
grown and multiplied to a colossal degree. 
The Party¹s reserves are: 
1) The contradictions between the different social 
groups within Russia. 
2) The contradictions and conflicts, which sometimes 
grow into military collisions, between the capitalist 
states around us. 
3) The socialist movement in the capitalist countries. 
4) The national-liberation movement in the backward 
and colonial countries. 
5) The peasantry and the Red Army in Russia. 
6) The diplomatic and foreign trade services. 
7) The entire might of state power. 
Such, in general, are the forces and potentialities 
within the framework of which‹and this framework is 
sufficiently wide‹the Party¹s strategy can manoeuvre, 
and on the basis of which the Party¹s tactics can carry 
out the day-to-day work of mobilising forces. 
All these are the favourable aspects of October 1917. 
But October also has an unfavourable aspect. The 
fact is that the proletariat took power in Russia under

THE PARTY BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING POWER 111 
distinctive internal and external circumstances which left 
their impress on the entire work of the Party after power 
was taken. 
Firstly, Russia is an economically backward country; 
it is very difficult for her to organise transport, develop 
industry, and electrify urban and rural industry 
by her own efforts unless she exchanges her raw materials 
for machinery and equipment from the Western countries. 
Secondly, to this day Russia is a socialist island surrounded 
by hostile, industrially more developed capitalist 
states. If Soviet Russia had as her neighbour one big 
industrially developed Soviet state, or several Soviet 
states, she could easily establish co-operation with those 
states on the basis of exchange of raw materials for machinery 
and equipment. But as long as that is not the case, 
Soviet Russia, and our Party which guides its government, 
are obliged to seek forms and methods of economic 
co-operation with the hostile capitalist groups in the West 
in order to obtain the necessary technical equipment 
until the proletarian revolution triumphs in one or several 
industrial capitalist countries. The concession form 
of relations and foreign trade‹such are the means for 
achieving this aim. Without this it will be difficult 
to count on decisive successes in economic construction, 
in the electrification of the country. This process will 
undoubtedly be slow and painful, but it is inevitable, 
unavoidable, and what is inevitable does not cease to be 
inevitable because some impatient comrades get nervous 
and demand quick results and spectacular operations. 
From the economic standpoint the present conflicts 
and military collisions between the capitalist groups, 
and also the struggle of the proletariat against the

J. V. S T A L I N 112 
capitalist class, are based on the conflict between the present-
day productive forces and the national imperialist 
framework of their development and the capitalist 
forms of appropriation. The imperialist framework and 
the capitalist form of appropriation strangle the productive 
forces, prevent them from developing. The only way 
out is to organise world economy on the basis of economic 
co-operation between the advanced (industrial) and backward 
(fuel and raw material supplying) countries (and 
not on the basis of the plunder of the latter by the former). 
It is precisely for this purpose that the international 
proletarian revolution is needed. Without this revolution 
it is useless thinking of the organisation and 
normal development of world economy. But in order to 
be able to start (at least to start) organising world economy 
on proper lines, the proletariat must triumph at 
least in several advanced countries. So long as that is 
not the case, our Party must seek roundabout ways of 
co-operation with capitalist groups in the economic field. 
That is why the Party, which has overthrown the 
bourgeoisie in our country and has raised the banner of 
the proletarian revolution, nevertheless considers it expedient 
to ³untie² small production and small industry 
in our country, to permit the partial revival of capitalism, 
although making it dependent upon the state authority, 
to attract leaseholders and shareholders, etc., etc., 
until the Party¹s policy of ³doing the utmost possible 
in one country for the development, support and awakening 
of the revolution in all countries² produces real 
results. 
Such are the distinctive conditions, favourable and 
unfavourable, that were created by October 1917, and

THE PARTY BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING POWER 113 
in which our Party is operating and developing in the 
third period of its existence. 
These conditions determine the colossal might that 
our Party now possesses inside and outside Russia. They, 
too, determine the incredible difficulties and dangers 
that the Party is facing, and which it must overcome at 
all costs. 
The Party¹s tasks in this period in the sphere of 
foreign policy are determined by its position as the party 
of international revolution. These tasks are: 
1) To utilise all the contradictions and conflicts 
among the capitalist groups and governments which surround 
our country, with the object of disintegrating 
imperialism. 
2) To stint no forces and resources to assist the proletarian 
revolution in the West. 
3) To take all measures to strengthen the nationalliberation 
movement in the East. 
4) To strengthen the Red Army. 
The Party¹s tasks in this period in the sphere of 
home policy are determined by its position within Russia 
as the party of peaceful construction. These tasks are: 
1) To strengthen the alliance between the proletariat 
and the toiling peasantry by: 
a) recruiting for the work of state construction those 
elements of the peasantry which possess most initiative 
and business ability; 
b) assisting peasant farming by disseminating agricultural 
knowledge, repairing machines, and so forth; 
c) developing proper exchange of products between 
town and country; 
d) gradually electrifying agriculture.

J. V. S T A L I N 114 
An important circumstance must be borne in mind. 
In contrast to the revolutions and proletarian parties 
in the West, a fortunate feature of our revolution, and 
a tremendous asset for our Party, is the fact that in Russia, 
the largest and most powerful strata of the petty 
bourgeoisie, namely the peasantry, were transformed from 
a potential reserve of the bourgeoisie into an actual reserve 
of the proletariat. This circumstance determined 
the weakness of the Russian bourgeoisie and served 
the interests of the Russian proletariat. It is mainly due 
to the fact that, in contrast to what occurred in the West, 
the liberation of the peasants from bondage to the landlords 
took place in Russia under the leadership of the 
proletariat. That served as the basis also for the alliance 
between the proletariat and the toiling peasantry in Russia. 
It is the duty of the Communists to cherish that 
alliance and to strengthen it. 
2) To develop industry by: 
a) concentrating the maximum forces on the task 
of mastering the basic industries and improving supplies 
for the workers engaged in them; 
b) developing foreign trade with a view to importing 
machinery and equipment; 
c) attracting shareholders and leaseholders; 
d) creating at least a minimum food fund for manoeuvring; 
e) electrifying transport and large-scale industry. 
Such, in general, are the Party¹s tasks in its present period 
of development.

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 
AND THE NATIONAL POLICY 
OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS 
The strength of the October Revolution lies, among 
other things, in that, unlike the revolutions in the West, 
it rallied around the Russian proletariat the many millions 
of the petty bourgeoisie, and, above all, its most 
numerous and powerful strata‹the peasantry. As a result, 
the Russian bourgeoisie was isolated and left without 
an army, while the Russian proletariat became the arbiter 
of the destiny of the country. But for that the Russian 
workers would not have retained power. 
Peace, the agrarian revolution and freedom for the 
nationalities‹these were the three principal factors which 
served to rally the peasants of more than twenty nationalities 
in the vast expanse of Russia around the Red 
Flag of the Russian proletariat. 
There is no need to speak here of the first two factors. 
Enough has been said about them in the literature 
on the subject, and indeed they speak for themselves. 
As for the third factor‹the national policy of the Russian 
Communists‹apparently, its importance has not 
yet been fully realised. It will therefore not be superfluous 
to say a few words on this subject. 
To begin with, of the 140,000,000 of the population 
of the R.S.F.S.R. (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania 
and Poland excluded), the Great Russians do not number

J. V. S T A L I N 116 
more than 75,000,000. The remaining 65,000,000 belong 
to nations other than the Great-Russian. 
Furthermore, these nations mainly inhabit the border 
regions, which are the most vulnerable from the 
military point of view; and these border regions abound 
in raw materials, fuel and foodstuffs. 
Lastly, in industrial and military respects these border 
regions are less developed than central Russia (or are not 
developed at all), and, as a consequence, they are not 
in a position to maintain their independent existence 
without the military and economic assistance of central 
Russia, just as central Russia is not in a position to 
maintain its military and economic power without assistance 
in fuel, raw materials and food from the border 
regions. 
These circumstances, coupled with certain provisions 
of the national programme of communism, determined 
the character of the national policy of the Russian Communists. 
The essence of this policy can be expressed in a few 
words: renunciation of all ³claims² and ³rights² to regions 
inhabited by non-Russian nations; recognition (not 
in words but in deeds) of the right of these nations to 
exist as independent states; a voluntary military and 
economic union of these nations with central Russia; 
assistance to the backward nations in their cultural and 
economic development, without which what is known 
as ³national equality of rights² becomes an empty 
sound; all this based on the complete emancipation of 
the peasants and the concentration of all power in the 
hands of the labouring elements of the border nations‹ 
such is the national policy of the Russian Communists.

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL POLICY 117 
Needless to say, the Russian workers who came to 
power would not have been able to win the sympathy 
and confidence of their comrades of other nations, and 
above all of the oppressed masses of the unequal nations, 
had they not proved in practice their willingness to carry 
out such a national policy, had they not renounced their 
³right² to Finland, had they not withdrawn their troops 
from Northern Persia, had they not renounced the claims 
of the Russian imperialists to certain regions of Mongolia 
and China, and had they not assisted the backward nations 
of the former Russian Empire to develop their 
culture and statehood in their own languages. 
That confidence alone could serve as the basis 
for that indestructible union of the peoples of the 
R.S.F.S.R., against which all ³diplomatic² machinations 
and carefully executed ³blockades² have proved 
impotent. 
More than that. The Russian workers could not have 
defeated Kolchak, Denikin and Wrangel had they not 
enjoyed the sympathy and confidence of the oppressed 
masses of the border regions of former Russia. It must 
not be forgotten that the field of action of these mutinous 
generals was limited to border regions inhabited 
mainly by non-Russian nations, and the latter could 
not but hate Kolchak, Denikin and Wrangel for their 
imperialist policy and policy of Russification. The Entente, 
which intervened and supported these generals, 
could rely only on those elements in the border regions 
which were the vehicles of Russification. That served 
only to inflame the hatred of the people of the border 
regions for the mutinous generals and increased their 
sympathy for the Soviet power.

J. V. S T A L I N 118 
This circumstance accounted for the internal weakness 
of the Kolchak, Denikin and Wrangel rears, and 
therefore for the weakness of their fronts, that is, in the 
long run, for their defeat. 
But the beneficial results of the national policy of 
the Russian Communists are not confined to the territory 
of the R.S.F.S.R. and the Soviet republics associated 
with it. They are also seen, indirectly, it is true, in the 
attitude of the neighbouring countries towards the 
R.S.F.S.R. The radical improvement in the attitude 
of Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, India and other Eastern 
countries towards Russia, which was formerly a bogey 
to these countries, is a fact which even so valiant a politician 
as Lord Curzon does not now venture to dispute. 
It scarcely needs proof that if the national policy outlined 
above had not been systematically carried out in 
the R.S.F.S.R. during the four years of the existence 
of Soviet power, this radical change in the attitude of 
the neighbouring countries towards Russia would have 
been inconceivable. 
Such, in the main, are the results of the national 
policy of the Russian Communists. And these results are 
especially clear today, on the fourth anniversary of Soviet 
power, when the hard war is over, when extensive 
construction work has begun, and when one involuntarily 
looks back along the path travelled in order to take it in 
at a single glance.

THE PROSPECTS 
The international situation is of paramount importance 
in the life of Russia. It is so not only because 
Russia, like every other country in Europe, is linked by 
innumerable threads with the neighbouring capitalist 
countries, but also, and primarily, because, being a Soviet 
country and therefore a ³menace² to the bourgeois world, 
she finds herself, as a result of the course of events, 
surrounded by a hostile camp of bourgeois states. It 
is obvious that the state of affairs in that camp, the relation 
of the contending forces within that camp, cannot 
but be of paramount importance for Russia. 
The chief factor that characterises the international 
situation is that the period of open war has been replaced 
by a period of ³peaceful² struggle, that there has arisen 
some degree of mutual recognition of the contending 
forces and an armistice between them, between the Entente, 
as the head of the bourgeois counter-revolution, 
on the one hand, and Russia, as the advanced detachment 
of the proletarian revolution, on the other. The 
struggle has shown that we (the workers) are not yet 
strong enough to put an end to imperialism forthwith. 
But the struggle has also shown that they (the bourgeoisie) 
are no longer strong enough to strangle Soviet Russia. 
As a consequence of this, the ³fright² or ³horror² 
which the proletarian revolution aroused in the world

J. V. S T A L I N 120 
bourgeoisie when, for example, the Red Army was advancing 
on Warsaw, has disappeared, evaporated. At 
the same time the boundless enthusiasm with which the 
workers of Europe received almost every bit of news 
about Soviet Russia is also disappearing. 
A period of sober weighing up of forces has set in, 
a period of molecular work in training and accumulating 
forces for future battles. 
That does not mean that the certain degree of equilibrium 
of forces that was established already at the 
beginning of 1921 has remained unchanged. Not at all. 
Recovering from the blows of revolution sustained 
as a consequence of the imperialist war, and pulling itself 
together, the world bourgeoisie passed from defence 
to an attack on ³its own² workers and, making skilful 
use of the industrial crisis, hurled the workers back into 
worse conditions of existence (reduction of wages, longer 
working day, mass unemployment). The results of 
that offensive were exceptionally severe for Germany 
where (besides everything else) the precipitous fall in 
the rate of exchange of the mark still further worsened 
the conditions of the workers. 
That gave rise to a powerful movement within the 
working class (particularly in Germany) for the creation 
of a united workers¹ front and for the establishment of 
a workers¹ government, a movement that called for agreement 
and joint struggle against the common enemy on the 
part of all the more or less revolutionary groups among 
the working class, from the ³moderates² to the ³extremists.² 
There is no ground for doubting that in the struggle 
for a workers¹ government the Communists will be 
in the front ranks, for such a struggle must lead to the

THE PROSPECTS 121 
further demoralisation of the bourgeoisie and to the conversion 
of the present Communist Parties into genuine 
mass workers¹ parties. 
But the matter is by no means confined to the offensive 
of the bourgeoisie against ³its own² workers. 
The bourgeoisie is aware that it cannot crush ³its own² 
workers unless it curbs Russia. Hence the ever-increasing 
activity of the bourgeoisie in preparing a new offensive 
against Russia, a more complex and thorough offensive 
than all the previous ones. 
Of course, trade and other treaties are being and 
will be concluded with Russia, and this is of immense 
importance for Russia. But it must not be forgotten 
that the trading and all other sorts of missions and associations 
that are now pouring into Russia, trading with 
her and aiding her, are at the same time most efficient 
spy agencies of the world bourgeoisie, and that, therefore, 
the world bourgeoisie now knows Soviet Russia, knows 
her weak and strong sides, better than at any time before, 
a circumstance fraught with grave danger in the event of 
new interventionist actions. 
Of course, the friction over the Eastern question 
has been reduced to ³misunderstandings.² But it must 
not be forgotten that Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan and 
the Far East are being flooded with agents of imperialism, 
gold and other ³blessings,² in order to create an 
economic (and not only economic) cordon around Soviet 
Russia. It scarcely needs proof that the so-called ³peace² 
conference in Washington35 promises us nothing really 
peaceful. 
Of course, we are on the ³very best² terms with Poland, 
with Rumania and with Finland. But it must

J. V. S T A L I N 122 
not be forgotten that these countries, especially Poland 
and Rumania, are vigorously arming with the assistance 
of the Entente, are preparing for war (against whom if 
not against Russia?), that now, as in the past, they constitute 
the immediate reserves of imperialism, that it 
was they who recently landed on Russian territory (for 
espionage purposes?) whiteguard Savinkov and Petlura 
detachments. 
All these facts, and much more of a similar kind, 
are evidently separate links in the whole activity of 
preparing a new attack on Russia. 
A combination of economic and military struggle, a 
combined assault from within and from without‹such is 
the most likely form of this attack. 
Whether we succeed in making this attack impossible, 
or, i f i t is launched, in turning i t into a 
deadly weapon against the world bourgeoisie, depends 
upon the vigilance of the Communists in the rear and 
in the army, upon the success of our work in the economic 
field and, lastly, upon the staunchness of the Red 
Army. 
Such, in general, is the external situation. 
No less complex and, if you like, ³peculiar,² is 
the internal situation in Soviet Russia. It may be described 
in these words: a struggle to strengthen the alliance 
between the workers and the peasants on a new, economic, 
basis for the development of industry, agriculture 
and transport, or in other words: a struggle to maintain 
and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat in a 
situation of economic ruin. 
There is a theory current in the West that the workers 
can take and hold power only in a country where

THE PROSPECTS 123 
they constitute the majority, or, at all events, where 
the people engaged in industry constitute the majority. 
It is indeed on these grounds that Messrs. the Kautskys 
deny the ³legitimacy² of the proletarian revolution in 
Russia, where the proletariat is in the minority. This 
theory is based on the tacit assumption that the petty 
bourgeoisie, primarily the peasantry, cannot support the 
workers in their struggle for power, that the mass of 
the peasantry constitutes a reserve of the bourgeoisie 
and not of the proletariat. The historical basis of this 
assumption lies in the fact that at critical moments 
in the West (France, Germany) the petty bourgeoisie 
(the peasantry) were usually found on the side of the bourgeoisie 
(1848 and 1871 in France, attempts at proletarian 
revolution in Germany after 1918). 
The reasons for this are: 
1) The bourgeois revolution took place in the West 
under the leadership of the bourgeoisie (at that time 
the proletariat merely served as the battering ram of the 
revolution); there the peasantry received land and emancipation 
from feudal bondage from the hands of the 
bourgeoisie, so to speak, and, as a consequence, the influence 
of the bourgeoisie over the peasantry was 
already then considered to be assured. 
2) More than half a century elapsed from the beginning 
of the bourgeois revolution in the West to the first 
attempts at proletarian revolution. During that period 
the peasantry managed to give rise to a powerful rural 
bourgeoisie, exercising strong influence in the countryside, 
which served as a connecting bridge between the 
peasantry and big urban capital, thereby strengthening 
the hegemony of the bourgeoisie over the peasantry.

J. V. S T A L I N 124 
It was in that historical situation that the abovementioned 
theory arose. 
An entirely different picture is revealed in Russia. 
First, in contrast to the West, the bourgeois revolution 
in Russia (February-March 1917) took place 
under the leadership of the proletariat, in fierce battles 
against the bourgeoisie, in the course of which the 
peasantry rallied around the proletariat as around 
their leader. 
Secondly, the attempt (successful) at proletarian 
revolution in Russia (October 1917), also in contrast to 
the West, did not begin half a century after the bourgeois 
revolution, but immediately after it, within a matter 
of 6-8 months, during which period it was, of course, 
impossible for a powerful and organised rural bourgeoisie 
to spring up from among the peasantry; moreover, 
the big bourgeoisie that was overthrown in October 1917 
was never able to recover. 
This latter circumstance still further strengthened 
the alliance between the workers and the peasants. 
That is why the Russian workers, although constituting 
a minority of the population of Russia, nevertheless 
found themselves the masters of the country, won the 
sympathy and support of the vast majority of the population, 
primarily of the peasantry, and took and held 
power, whereas, in spite of all theories, the bourgeoisie 
found itself isolated, was left without the peasant 
reserves. 
From this it follows that: 
1) The above-mentioned theory that the proletariat 
³must constitute the majority² of the population is inadequate 
and incorrect from the standpoint of Russian

THE PROSPECTS 125 
reality, or, at all events, is interpreted in too simple 
and vulgar a manner by Messrs. the Kautskys. 
2) Under the present historical conditions, the actual 
alliance between the proletariat and the toiling 
peasantry that was formed in the course of the revolution 
is the basis of Soviet power in Russia. 
3) It is the duty of the Communists to maintain and 
strengthen that actual alliance. 
The whole point in the present case is that the 
forms of this alliance are not always the same. 
Previously, during the war, we had to deal with what 
was chiefly a military-political alliance, i.e., we expelled 
the landlords from Russia and gave the peasants 
the land for their use, and when the landlords went to 
war to recover ³their property² we fought them and upheld 
the gains of the revolution; in return the peasants 
provided food for the workers and men for the army. 
That was one form of the alliance. 
Now that the war is over and danger no longer threatens 
the land, the old form of alliance is not adequate 
any more. Another form of alliance is needed. Now it is 
no longer a matter of saving the land for the peasants, 
but of ensuring the peasants the right freely to dispose 
of the produce of that land. In the absence of such right 
there will inevitably be: a further diminution of the crop 
area, a progressive decline of agriculture, paralysis of 
transport and industry (due to food shortage), demoralisation 
of the army (due to food shortage), and, as a result 
of all this, the inevitable collapse of the actual alliance 
between the workers and the peasants. It scarcely needs 
proof that possession by the state of a certain minimum 
of grain stocks is the mainspring of the revival of

J. V. S T A L I N 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
126 
industry and the preservation of the Soviet state. Kronstadt 
(the spring of 1921) was a warning that the old 
form of alliance was obsolete and that a new form was 
needed, an economic form, that would be of economic 
advantage both to the workers and to the peasants. 
That is the key to an understanding of the New Economic 
Policy. 
Abolition of the surplus appropriation system and 
of other similar obstacles was the first step along the 
new road that freed the hands of the small producer 
and gave an impetus to the production of more food, raw 
materials and other produce. It will not be difficult 
to understand the colossal importance of this step if it 
is borne in mind that Russia is making the same mass 
onrush towards the development of productive forces as 
North America experienced after the Civil War. There is 
no doubt that, while releasing the productive energy of 
the small producer and ensuring certain advantages for 
him, this step will, however, put him in a position‹ 
bearing in mind that the state remains in control of transport 
and industry‹in which he will be compelled to bring 
grist to the mill of the Soviet state. 
But it is not enough to secure an increase in the 
production of food and raw materials. It is also necessary 
to collect, to accumulate, a certain minimum stock 
of these products necessary for the maintenance of transport, 
industry, the army, etc. Therefore, leaving aside 
the tax in kind, which simply supplements the abolition 
of the surplus appropriation system, we must regard 
as the second step the transfer of the collection of food 
and raw materials to the Central Union of Consumers¹ 
Co-operatives (Centrosoyuz). It is true that the lack

THE PROSPECTS 127 
of discipline in the local organisations of the Centrosoyuz, 
their inability to adapt themselves to the commodity 
market that has rapidly developed, the unsuitability 
of barter as a form of exchange and the rapid development 
of the money form, the shortage of currency, etc., 
have prevented the Centrosoyuz from fulfilling the assignments 
allotted to it. But there are no grounds for doubting 
that the role of the Centrosoyuz as the principal apparatus 
for the wholesale purchase of the chief items of food 
and raw materials will grow day by day. It is only necessary 
that the state should: 
a) make the Centrosoyuz the centre for financing trade 
operations (other than state) within the country; 
b) make the other forms of co-operative organisation 
which are still hostilely disposed to the state financially 
subordinate to the Centrosoyuz; 
c) in some form or other give the Centrosoyuz access 
to foreign trade. 
The opening of the State Bank as the organ for regulating 
the currency within the country must be regarded 
as the third step. The development of the commodity 
market and the currency leads to the following two 
chief results: 
1) it will make commercial operations (private and 
state) and production operations (wage rates, and so 
forth) completely dependent on the fluctuations of the 
ruble; 
2) it will transform Russia¹s national economy from 
the isolated, self-contained economy it was during the 
blockade into an exchange economy that will trade with 
the outside world, i.e., that will depend on the fortuitous 
fluctuations of the exchange rate of the ruble.

J. V. S T A L I N 128 
But from this it follows that if the currency is not 
put in order and if the exchange rate of the ruble is not 
improved, our economic operations, both home and foreign, 
will be in a bad way. The State Bank as the regulator 
of the currency, capable of being not only a creditor 
but also a pump for extracting the colossal private savings 
which could be put into circulation and make it 
possible for us to do without new emissions‹this State 
Bank is still ³music of the future,² although, according 
to all the data, it has a great future. 
The next means of raising the exchange rate of the 
ruble must be an extension of our exports and an improvement 
of our desperately unfavourable balance of trade. 
It must be supposed that drawing the Centrosoyuz into 
foreign trade will be of assistance in this matter. 
Furthermore, we need a foreign loan not only as a 
means of payment, but also as a factor that will enhance 
our credit abroad and, consequently, enhance confidence 
in our ruble. 
Further, the mixed trading and transit and other companies 
that Sokolnikov wrote about in Pravda recently 
would undoubtedly also help matters. It must be observed, 
however, that the granting of industrial concessions 
and the development of the proper exchange of our raw 
materials for foreign machinery and equipment, about 
which so much was written in our press some time ago, 
while being factors promoting the development of money 
economy, are themselves wholly dependent upon a preliminary 
improvement of the exchange rate of our ruble. 
Lastly, the fourth step must be the placing of our 
enterprises on a business basis, the closing and leasing 
out of the small non-paying enterprises, the singling

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE NATIONAL POLICY 129 
out of the soundest of the big enterprises, drastic reduction 
of inflated staffs in government offices, the drawing 
up of a firm material and financial state budget and, as 
a result of all this, the expulsion of the charity spirit 
from our enterprises and offices, the general tightening 
up of discipline among factory and office workers, and 
improvement and intensification of their labour. 
Such, in general, are the measures that have been 
and are to be taken and which, in the aggregate, constitute 
the so-called New Economic Policy. 
Needless to say, in carrying out these measures we, 
as was to be expected, have made a large number of mistakes, 
which have distorted their true character. Nevertheless, 
it can be taken as proved that it is precisely 
these measures that open the road along which we can 
promote the economic revival of the country, raise agriculture 
and industry and strengthen the economic alliance 
between the proletarians and the toiling peasants, 
in spite of everything, in spite of threats from without 
and famine within Russia. 
The first results of the New Economic Policy in the 
shape of the incipient expansion of the crop area, the 
increase in the productivity of labour in the factories, 
and the improvement in the mood of the peasants (cessation 
of mass banditry) undoubtedly confirm this conclusion.

Pravda was born in the waves of the revolutionary 
upsurge during the famous ³Lena events.² The appearance 
of Pravda, the newspaper for the masses of the 
workers, precisely during those days marked: 
1) the passing of the period of general weariness in 
the country following the Stolypin regime of ³peace and 
quiet,² 
2) the mighty awakening of the Russian working 
class for a new revolution, the second after the 1905 
revolution, 
3) the beginning of the winning of the broad masses 
of the working class to the side of the Bolsheviks. 
The Pravda of 1912 was the laying of the cornerstone

THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF PRAVDA 
(Reminiscences) 
1. THE LENA EVENTS 
The Lena events were the result of the Stolypin regime 
of ³pacification.² The younger members of the Party, 
of course, have not experienced and do not remember 
the charms of this regime. As for the old ones, they, no 
doubt, remember the punitive expeditions of accursed 
memory, the savage raids on working-class organisations, 
the mass flogging of peasants, and, as a screen 
to all this, the Black-Hundred-Cadet Duma. Public 
opinion in shackles, general lassitude and apathy, want 
and despair among the workers, the peasantry downtrodden 
and terrified, with gangs of the police, landowners 
and capitalists rampant everywhere‹such were the typical 
features of Stolypin¹s ³pacification.² 
To the superficial observer it might have seemed 
that the epoch of revolution had passed away forever, 
and that a period of the ³constitutional² development 
of Russia on the lines of Prussia had set in. The Menshevik 
Liquidators openly shouted that this was so and 
preached the necessity of organising a Stolypin legal 
workers¹ party. And certain old ³Bolsheviks,² who in their 
hearts sympathised with this preaching, made haste to 
desert the ranks of our Party. The triumph of the knout 
and the powers of darkness was complete. At that time

J. V. S T A L I N 132 
The Lena events burst into this ³abomination of 
desolation² like a hurricane and revealed a new picture 
to everybody. It turned out that the Stolypin regime was 
not so stable after all, that the Duma was rousing the 
contempt of the masses, and that the working class had 
accumulated sufficient energy to rush into battle for a 
new revolution. The shooting down of workers in the remote 
depths of Siberia (Bodaibo on the Lena) sufficed 
to call forth strikes all over Russia, and the St. Petersburg 
workers poured into the streets and at one stroke 
swept from the path the boastful Minister Makarov and 
his insolent slogan ³So it was, so it will be.² These were 
the first harbingers of the mighty movement that was 
then beginning. Zvezda36 was right when it exclaimed at 
that time: ³We live! Our scarlet blood seethes with the 
fire of unspent strength. . . .² The upsurge of a new revolutionary 
movement was evident. 
It was in the waves of this movement that the mass 
working-class newspaper Pravda was born. 
2. THE FOUNDATION OF PRAVDA 
It was in the middle of April 1912, one evening at 
Comrade Poletayev¹s house, where two members of the 
Duma (Pokrovsky and Poletayev), two writers (Olminsky 
and Baturin) and I, a member of the Central Committee 
(I, being in hiding, had found ³sanctuary² in the house 
of Poletayev, who enjoyed ³parliamentary immunity²) 
reached agreement concerning Pravda¹s platform and compiled 
the first issue of the newspaper. I do not remember 
whether Demyan Byedny and Danilov, two very close 
contributors to Pravda, were present at this conference.

THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF PRAVDA 133 
The technical and financial prerequisites for the 
newspaper had already been provided thanks to the agitation 
conducted by Zvezda, the sympathy of the broad 
masses of the workers, and the mass voluntary collection 
of funds for Pravda in the mills and factories. Truly, 
Pravda came into being as a result of the efforts of the 
working class of Russia, and above all of St. Petersburg. 
Had it not been for these efforts, the newspaper could 
not have existed. 
Pravda¹s complexion was clear: its mission was to 
popularise Zvezda¹s programme among the masses. In 
its very first issue Pravda wrote: ³Anyone who reads 
Zvezda and knows its contributors, who are also contributors 
to Pravda, will not find it difficult to understand 
the line Pravda will pursue.²37 The only difference 
between Zvezda and Pravda was that the latter, 
unlike the former, did not address itself to the advanced 
workers, but to the broad masses of the working 
class. It was Pravda¹s function to help the advanced 
workers to rally around the Party¹s banner the broad 
strata of the Russian working class who had awakened 
for a fresh struggle but were still politically backward. 
That is precisely why one of the aims Pravda set itself 
at that time was to train writers from among the 
workers and to draw them into the work of directing 
the paper. 
In its very first issue Pravda wrote: ³We would like 
the workers not to confine themselves to sympathy alone, 
but to take an active part in the conduct of our newspaper. 
Let not the workers say that they are Œnot used to¹ 
writing. Working-class writers do not drop ready-made 
from the skies, they can be trained only gradually, in the

J. V. S T A L I N 134 
course of literary activity. All that is needed is to start 
on the job boldly: you may stumble once or twice, but 
in the end you will learn to write. . . .²38 
3. THE ORGANISATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 
OF PRAVDA 
Pravda made its appearance in that period of our 
Party¹s development when the underground organisation 
was entirely in the hands of the Bolsheviks (the Mensheviks 
had fled from it), but the legal forms of organisation‹
the group in the Duma, the press, sick-benefit 
societies, insurance societies, trade-union organisations 
‹had not yet been completely won from the Mensheviks. 
It was a period in which the Bolsheviks were waging a 
determined struggle to expel the Liquidators (Mensheviks) 
from the legal working-class organisations. The 
slogan ³Dismiss the Mensheviks from their posts² was 
then a most popular slogan of the working-class movement. 
The columns of Pravda bristled with reports of 
the expulsion from the insurance societies, sick-benefit 
societies and trade-union organisations of the Liquidators 
who at one time had entrenched themselves in them. 
All six deputies¹ seats in the workers¹ curia had been 
won from the Mensheviks. The Menshevik press was also 
in the same, or almost the same, hopeless position. It 
was truly a heroic struggle that the Bolshevik-minded 
workers waged for the Party, for the agents of tsarism 
were wide awake, hunting and rooting out the Bolsheviks, 
and the Party, driven deep underground, could 
not develop further unless it had a legal cover. More 
than that: under the political conditions prevailing at

THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF PRAVDA 135 
that time, the Party could not put out feelers towards 
the broad masses and rally them around its banner unless 
it won the legal organisations; it would have been 
cut off from the masses and would have been transformed 
into an isolated group, stewing in its own juice. 
Pravda was the centre of this struggle for the Party 
principle, for the creation of a mass workers¹ party. It 
was not merely a newspaper that summed up the successes 
of the Bolsheviks in winning the legal workers¹ 
organisations; it was also the organising centre which 
united these organisations around the underground centres 
of the Party and directed the working-class movement 
towards a single definite goal. Already in his book 
What Is To Be Done? (1902), Comrade Lenin had written 
that a well-organised all-Russian militant newspaper 
must be not only a collective agitator, but also a collective 
organiser. That is exactly the kind of newspaper 
which Pravda became in the period of the struggle against 
the Liquidators for the preservation of the underground 
organisation and for winning the legal organisations of 
the workers. If it is true that, had we not defeated the 
Liquidators we would not have had the Party which, 
strong in its unity and invincible because of its devotion 
to the proletariat, organised October 1917, then it is 
equally true that the persevering and devoted struggle 
of the old Pravda to a considerable degree prepared and 
hastened this victory over the Liquidators. In this sense 
the old Pravda was undoubtedly the herald of the future 
glorious victories of the Russian proletariat.

COMRADE LENIN ON VACATION 
NOTES 
It seems to me that it would not be fitting now to write 
of ³Comrade Lenin on Vacation,² when the vacation 
is coming to an end and Comrade Lenin will soon return 
to work. Besides, my impressions are so many and so 
precious that it is not quite expedient to write about 
them in a brief note, as the editorial board of Pravda 
requests. However, I must write, for the editorial board 
insists on it. 
I had occasion to meet at the front veteran fighters 
who, after fighting continuously for several days ³on 
end,² without sleep or rest, would come back from the 
firing line looking like shadows and drop like logs, but 
after having ³slept the clock round² they would rise refreshed 
and eager for new battles, without which they 
³cannot live.² When I first visited Comrade Lenin in 
July, not having seen him for six weeks, that was just 
the impression he made on me‹that of a veteran fighter 
who had managed to get some rest after incessant and 
exhausting battles, and who had been refreshed by his 
rest. He looked fresh and recuperated, but still bore 
traces of overwork and fatigue.

COMRADE LENIN ON VACATION 137 
³I am not allowed to read the newspapers,² Comrade 
Lenin remarked ironically, ³and I must not talk politics. 
I carefully avoid every scrap of paper lying on the 
table, lest it turn out to be a newspaper and lead to a 
breach of discipline.² 
I laughed heartily and praised him to the skies for 
his obedience to discipline. We proceeded to make merry 
over the doctors, who cannot understand that when professional 
men of politics get together they cannot help 
talking politics. 
What struck one in Comrade Lenin was his thirst 
for information and his craving, his insuperable craving 
for work. It is clear that he had been famished. 
The trial of the Socialist-Revolutionaries,39 Genoa and 
The Hague,40 the harvest prospects, industry and finance 
all these questions came up in swift succession. 
He was in no hurry to express his opinion, complaining 
that he was out of touch with events; for the 
most part he asked questions and took silent note. He 
became very cheerful on learning that the harvest prospects 
were good. 
I found an entirely different picture a month later. 
This time Comrade Lenin was surrounded by stacks 
of books and newspapers (he had been given permission 
to read and talk politics to his heart¹s content). 
There was no longer any trace of fatigue, of overwork. 
There was no sign of that nervous craving for work‹ 
he was no longer famished. Calmness and self-assurance 
had fully returned. This was our old Lenin, 
screwing up his eyes and gazing shrewdly at his interlocutor. 
. . .

And this time our talk, too, was of a more lively 
character. 
Home affairs . . . the harvest . . . the state of industry 
. . . the rate of exchange of the ruble . . . the 
budget. . . . 
³The situation is difficult. But the worst is over. 
The harvest will make a fundamental difference. It is 
bound to be followed by an improvement in industry 
and finance. The thing now is to relieve the state 
of unnecessary expenditure by retrenchment in our 
institutions and enterprises and by improving them. 
We must be particularly firm in this matter, and we 
shall squeeze through, we shall most certainly squeeze 
through.² 
Foreign affairs . . . the Entente . . . France¹s behaviour 
. . . Britain and Germany . . . the role of 
America . . . . 
³They are greedy, and they hate one another profoundly. 
They will be at loggerheads yet. We need be in no 
hurry. Ours is a sure road: we are for peace and for agreement, 
but we are against enslavement and enslaving 
terms of agreement. We must keep a firm hand on the 
wheel and steer our own course, without yielding to 
either flattery or intimidation.² 
The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, and 
their rabid agitation against Soviet Russia . . . . 
³Yes, they have made it their aim to defame Soviet 
Russia. They are facilitating the imperialists¹ fight 
against Soviet Russia. They have been caught in the 
mire of capitalism, and are sliding into an abyss. Let 
them flounder. They have long been dead as far as the 
working class is concerned.²

if it is any consolation to them; one should not rob the 
dying of their last consolation.²

THE QUESTION OF THE UNION 
OF THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL 
REPUBLICS 
Interview With a Pravda Correspondent 
Interviewed by our correspondent on questions concerning 
the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Comrade 
Stalin gave the following explanations:41 
Who initiated the movement for the union of the 
independent republics? 
‹The republics themselves initiated the movement. 
About three months ago, leading circles of the Transcaucasian 
republics already raised the question of forming 
a united economic front of Soviet Socialist Republics 
and of uniting them in a single union state. The 
question was then put before wide Party meetings in 
some districts of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia and, 
as is evident from the resolutions that were passed, it 
roused unprecedented enthusiasm. At about the same 
time the question of union was raised in the Ukraine and 
in Byelorussia, and there too, as in Transcaucasia, it 
roused marked enthusiasm among wide Party circles. 
These facts are indubitable evidence of the vitality 
of the movement and show that the question of uniting 
the republics has certainly matured. 
What gave rise to the movement; what are its basic 
motives?

J. V. S T A L I N 142 
‹The motives are chiefly economic. Assistance to 
peasant farming, the raising of industry, improving means 
of transport and communication, financial questions, 
questions concerning concessions and other economic 
agreements, joint action in foreign markets as buyers or 
sellers of commodities‹such are the questions that gave 
rise to the movement for the formation of a Union of 
Republics. The exhaustion of the internal economic resources 
of our republics as a result of the Civil War, on 
the one hand, and the absence of any considerable influx 
of foreign capital, on the other, have created a situation 
in which none of our Soviet republics is in a position 
to restore its national economy by its own unaided efforts. 
This circumstance makes itself specially felt now when 
for the first time since the termination of the Civil War 
the Soviet republics have set to work in earnest to solve 
their economic problems, and here, in the course of this 
work, have, for the first time, realised the utter inadequacy 
of the isolated efforts of the individual republics, 
and how utterly inevitable is the combination of those 
efforts and the economic union of the republics as the 
sole way of really restoring industry and agriculture. 
But in order really to combine the economic efforts 
of the individual republics to the degree of uniting them 
in a single economic union, it is necessary to set up 
appropriate permanently functioning Union bodies capable 
of directing the economic life of these republics 
along one definite road. That is why the old economic 
and commercial treaties between these republics have 
now proved to be inadequate. That is why the movement 
for a Union of Republics has outgrown these treaties 
and has brought up the question of uniting the republics.

QUESTION OF UNION OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL REPUBLICS 143 
Do you think that this trend towards unity is an 
entirely new phenomenon, or has it a history? 
‹The movement for uniting the independent republics 
is not something unexpected and ³unprecedented.² 
It has a history. This unification movement has already 
passed through two phases of its development and has 
now entered the third. 
The first phase was the period 1918-21, the period 
of intervention and civil war, when the existence of the 
republics was in mortal danger, and when the republics 
were compelled to combine their military efforts in order 
to defend their existence. That phase culminated in the 
military union, the military alliance of the Soviet republics. 
The second phase was at the end of 1921 and beginning 
of 1922, the period of Genoa and The Hague, when 
the Western capitalist powers, disappointed in the efficacy 
of intervention, attempted to secure the restoration 
of capitalist property in the Soviet republics not 
by military but by diplomatic means, when a united 
diplomatic front of the Soviet republics was the inevitable 
means by which alone they could withstand the 
onslaught of the Western powers. On this ground arose 
the well-known agreement between the eight independent 
friendly republics and the R.S.F.S.R.,42 concluded before 
the opening of the Genoa Conference, which cannot be 
called anything else than the diplomatic union of the 
Soviet republics. Thus ended the second phase, the phase 
of the diplomatic union of our republics. 
Today, the movement for uniting the national republics 
has entered the third phase, the phase of economic 
union. It is not difficult to understand that the third

J. V. S T A L I N 144 
phase is the culmination of the two preceding phases of 
the movement for unification. 
Does it follow from this that the union of the republics 
will end in re-union with Russia, in merging with 
her, as is happening with the Far Eastern Republic? 
‹No. It does not! There is a fundamental difference 
between the Far Eastern Republic43 and the abovementioned 
national republics: 
a) whereas the former was established artificially (as a 
buffer), for tactical reasons (it was thought that the bourgeois-
democratic form would serve as a reliable guarantee 
against the imperialist designs of Japan and other powers) 
and not at all on a national basis, the latter, on 
the contrary, arose as the natural result of the development 
of the respective nationalities, and have chiefly 
a national basis; 
b) whereas the Far Eastern Republic can be abolished 
without in the least harming the national interests 
of the predominant population (for they are Russians, 
like the majority of the population of Russia), the abolition 
of the national republics would be a piece of reactionary 
folly, calling for the abolition of the non-Russian 
nationalities, their Russification, i.e., a piece of reactionary 
fanaticism that would rouse the protest even of 
obscurantist Russian chauvinists like the Black-Hundred 
member Shulgin. 
This explains the fact that as soon as the Far Eastern 
Republic became convinced that the bourgeois-democratic 
form was useless as a guarantee against the imperialists, 
it was able to abolish itself and become a 
constituent part of Russia, a region, like the Urals or 
Siberia, without a Council of People¹s Commissars or

QUESTION OF UNION OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL REPUBLICS 145 
Central Executive Committee, whereas the national republics, 
which are built on an entirely different basis, 
cannot be abolished, cannot be deprived of their Central 
Executive Committees and Councils of People¹s Commissars, 
of their national bases, as long as the nationalities 
which gave rise to them exist, as long as the national 
languages, culture, manner of life, habits and customs 
exist. That is why the union of the national Soviet republics 
into a single union state cannot end in their reunion, 
their merging, with Russia. 
What, in your opinion, should be the character and 
form of the union of the republics into a single Union? 
‹The character of the union should be voluntary, 
exclusively voluntary, and every national republic 
should retain the right to secede from the Union. Thus, 
the voluntary principle must be made the basis of the 
Treaty on the Formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics. 
The parties to the treaty of union are: the R.S.F.S.R. 
(as an integral federal unit), the Transcaucasian Federation44 
(also as an integral federal unit), the Ukraine 
and Byelorussia. Bukhara and Khorezm,45 not being 
Socialist, but only People¹s Soviet Republics, may, perhaps, 
remain outside of the union until their natural 
development converts them into Socialist Republics. 
The supreme organs of the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics are: the Union Central Executive Committee, 
to be elected by the constituent republics of the Union 
with representation in proportion to population; and the 
Union Council of People¹s Commissars, to be elected by 
the Union Central Executive Committee, as its executive 
organ.

J. V. S T A L I N 146 
The functions of the Union Central Executive 
Committee are: to draw up the fundamental guiding principles 
of the political and economic life of the republics 
and federations constituting the Union. 
The functions of the Union Council of People¹s 
Commissars are: 
a) direct and undivided control of the military affairs, 
foreign affairs, foreign trade, railways, and posts 
and telegraphs of the Union; 
b) leadership of the activities of the Commissariats 
of Finance, Food, National Economy, Labour, and State 
Inspection of the republics and federations constituting 
the Union; the Commissariats of Internal Affairs, Agriculture, 
Education, Justice, Social Maintenance, and 
Public Health of these republics and federations are to 
remain under the undivided and direct control of these 
republics and federations. 
Such, in my opinion, should be the general form of 
union in the Union of Republics, so far as it can be perceived 
in the movement for the union of the national 
republics. 
Some people are of the opinion that in addition to 
the two Union organs (Central Executive Committee and 
Council of People¹s Commissars) it is necessary to set 
up a third Union organ, an intermediary one, an Upper 
Chamber, so to speak, in which all the nationalities 
should be equally represented; but there can be no doubt 
that this opinion will not meet with any sympathy among 
the national republics, if only for the reason that a twochamber 
system, with an Upper Chamber, is incompatible 
with the structure of the Soviet system, at all 
events in its present stage of development.

QUESTION OF UNION OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL REPUBLICS 147 
How soon, in your opinion, will the Union of Republics 
be formed, and what will be its international 
significance? 
‹I think that the day of the formation of the Union 
of Republics is not far off. It is quite possible that the 
formation of the Union will coincide with the forthcoming 
convocation of the Tenth Congress of Soviets of 
the R.S.F.S.R. 
As for the international significance of this Union, 
it scarcely needs special explanation. If the military 
alliance of the Soviet republics in the period of the Civil 
War enabled us to repulse the military intervention 
of our enemies, and the diplomatic alliance of those 
republics in the period of Genoa and The Hague facilitated 
our struggle against the diplomatic onslaught of 
the Entente, the union of the Soviet republics in a single 
union state will undoubtedly create a form of all-round 
military and economic co-operation that will greatly facilitate 
the economic progress of the Soviet republics 
and convert them into a citadel against attacks by international 
capitalism.

THE UNION OF THE SOVIET 
REPUBLICS 
Report Delivered at the Tenth 
All-Russian Congress of Soviets46 
December 26, 1922 
Comrades, a few days ago, before this congress began, 
the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive 
Committee received a number of resolutions from Congresses 
of Soviets of the Transcaucasian republics, the 
Ukraine and Byelorussia on the desirability and necessity 
of uniting these republics into a single union state. 
The Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive 
Committee has had this question under consideration 
and has declared that such a union is opportune. As a 
result of its resolution, the question of uniting the republics 
is included in the agenda of this congress. 
The campaign for the union of the Soviet Socialist 
Republics began some three or four months ago. The initiative 
was taken by the Azerbaijanian, Armenian and 
Georgian Republics, which were later joined by the 
Ukrainian and Byelorussian Republics. The idea of the 
campaign is that the old treaty relations‹the relations 
established by the conventions between the R.S.F.S.R. 
and the other Soviet republics‹have served their purpose 
and are no longer adequate. The idea of the campaign 
is that we must inevitably pass from the old treaty relations 
to relations based on a closer union‹relations 
which imply the creation of a single union state with

THE UNION OF THE SOVIET REPUBLICS 149 
corresponding Union executive and legislative organs, 
with a Central Executive Committee and a Council of 
People¹s Commissars of the Union. To put it briefly, it 
is now, in the course of the campaign, proposed that what 
was formerly decided from time to time, within the 
framework of convention relations, should be put on a 
permanent basis. 
What are the reasons that impel the republics to 
take the path of union? What are the circumstances that 
have determined the necessity for union? 
Three groups of circumstances have made the union 
of the Soviet republics into a single union state inevitable. 
The first group of circumstances consists of facts 
relating to our internal economic situation. 
First, the meagreness of the economic resources left 
at the disposal of the republics after seven years of war. 
This compels us to combine these meagre resources so 
as to employ them more rationally and to develop the 
main branches of our economy which form the backbone 
of Soviet power in all the republics. 
Secondly, the historically evolved natural division 
of labour, the economic division of labour, between the 
various regions and republics of our federation. For instance, 
the North supplies the South and East with textiles, 
the South and East supply the North with cotton, 
fuel, and so forth. And this division of labour established 
between the regions cannot be eliminated by a mere stroke 
of the pen: it has been created historically by the whole 
course of economic development of the federation. And 
this division of labour, which makes the full development 
of the individual regions impossible as long as each

J. V. S T A L I N 150 
republic leads a separate existence, is compelling the 
republics to unite in a single economic whole. 
Thirdly, the unity of the principal means of communication 
in the entire federation, constituting the nerves 
and foundation of any possible union. It goes without 
saying that the means of communication cannot be allowed 
to have a divided existence, at the disposal of the 
individual republics and subordinated to their interests 
for that would convert the main nerve of economic life‹ 
transport‹into a conglomeration of separate parts utilised 
without a plan. This circumstance also inclines 
the republics towards union into a single state. 
Lastly, the meagreness of our financial resources 
Comrades, it must be bluntly stated that our financial 
position now, in the sixth year of existence of the Soviet 
regime, has far less opportunities for large-scale 
development than, for instance, under the old regime 
which had vodka, which we will not have, yielding 
500,000,000 rubles per annum, and which possessed foreign 
credits to the amount of several hundred million 
rubles, which we also do not have. All this goes to show 
that with such meagre opportunities for our financial 
development we shall not succeed in solving the fundamental 
and current problems of the financial systems of 
our republics unless we join forces and combine the financial 
strength of the individual republics into a single 
whole. 
Such is the first group of circumstances that are 
impelling our republics to take the path of union. 
The second group of circumstances that have determined 
the union of the republics are facts relating to 
our international situation. I have in mind our military

THE UNION OF THE SOVIET REPUBLICS 151 
situation. I have in mind our relations with foreign 
capital through the Commissariat of Foreign Trade. 
Lastly, I have in mind our diplomatic relations with 
the bourgeois states. It must be remembered, comrades, 
that in spite of the fact that our republics have happily 
emerged from the condition of civil war, the danger of 
attack from without is by no means excluded. This danger 
demands that our military front should be absolutely 
united, that our army should be an absolutely united 
army, particularly now that we have taken the path, 
not of moral disarmament, of course, but of a real, material 
reduction of armaments. Now that we have reduced 
our army to 600,000 men, it is particularly essential to 
have a single and continuous military front capable of 
safeguarding the republic against external danger. 
Furthermore, apart from the military danger, there 
is the danger of the economic isolation of our federation. 
You know that although the economic boycott of our 
Republic failed after Genoa and The Hague, and after 
Urquhart,47 no great influx of capital for the needs of 
our economy is to be observed. There is a danger of our 
republics being economically isolated. This new form 
of intervention, which is no less dangerous than military 
intervention, can be eliminated only by the creation of 
a united economic front of our Soviet republics in face 
of the capitalist encirclement. 
Lastly, there is our diplomatic situation. You have 
all seen how, recently, on the eve of the Lausanne Conference,
48 the Entente states made every effort to isolate 
our federation. Diplomatically, they did not succeed. 
The organised diplomatic boycott of our federation was 
broken. The Entente was forced to reckon with our

J. V. S T A L I N 152 
federation and to withdraw, to retreat to some extent. But 
there are no grounds for assuming that these and similar 
facts about the diplomatic isolation of our federation 
will not be repeated. Hence the necessity for a united 
front also in the diplomatic field. 
Such is the second group of circumstances that are 
impelling the Soviet Socialist Republics to take the 
path of union. 
Both the first and the second groups of circumstances 
have operated up to the present day, being in force during 
the whole period of the existence of the Soviet regime. 
Our economic needs, of which I have just spoken, 
as well as our military and diplomatic needs in the sphere 
of foreign policy were, undoubtedly, also felt before the 
present day. But those circumstances have acquired special 
force only now, after the termination of the Civil 
War, when the republics have for the first time obtained 
the opportunity to start economic construction, and for 
the first time realise how very meagre their economic 
resources are, and how very necessary union is as regards 
both internal economy and foreign relations. That is 
why now, in the sixth year of existence of the Soviet 
regime, the question of uniting the independent Soviet 
Socialist Republics has become an immediate one. 
Finally, there is a third group of facts, which also 
call for union and which are associated with the structure 
of the Soviet regime, with the class nature of the 
Soviet regime. The Soviet regime is so constructed that, 
being international in its intrinsic nature, it in every 
way fosters the idea of union among the masses and 
itself impels them to take the path of union. Whereas 
capital, private property and exploitation disunite peo

THE UNION OF THE SOVIET REPUBLICS 153 
ple, split them into mutually hostile camps, examples 
of which are provided by Great Britain, France and even 
small multi-national states like Poland and Yugoslavia 
with their irreconcilable internal national contradictions 
which corrode the very foundations of these states‹ 
whereas, I say, over there, in the West, where capitalist 
democracy reigns and where the states are based on private 
property, the very basis of the state fosters national 
bickering, conflicts and struggle, here, in the world 
of Soviets, where the regime is based not on capital but 
on labour, where the regime is based not on private 
property, but on collective property, where the regime 
is based not on the exploitation of man by man, but on 
the struggle against such exploitation, here, on the contrary, 
the very nature of the regime fosters among the 
labouring masses a natural striving towards union in a 
single socialist family. 
Is i t not significant that whereas over there, in 
the West, in the world of bourgeois democracy, we are 
witnessing the gradual decline and disintegration of 
the multi-national states into their component parts (as 
in the case of Great Britain, which has to settle matters 
with India, Egypt and Ireland, how, I do not know, or 
as in the case of Poland, which has to settle matters with 
its Byelorussians and Ukrainians, how, I do not know 
either), here, in our federation, which unites no fewer 
than thirty nationalities, we, on the contrary, are witnessing 
a process by which the state ties between the 
independent republics are becoming stronger, a process 
which is leading to an ever closer union of the independent 
nationalities in a single independent state! 
Thus you have two types of state union, of which the

J. V. S T A L I N 154 
first, the capitalist type, leads to the disintegration of the 
state, while the second, the Soviet type, on the contrary, 
leads to a gradual but enduring union of formerly independent 
nationalities into a single independent state. 
Such is the third group of facts that are impelling 
the individual republics to take the path of union. 
What should be the form of the union of the republics? 
The principles of the union are outlined in the resolutions 
which the Presidium of the All-Russian Central 
Executive Committee has received from the Soviet Republics 
of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Transcaucasia. 
Four Republics are to unite: the R.S.F.S.R. as an 
integral federal unit, the Transcaucasian Republic, also 
as an integral federal unit, the Ukraine, and Byelorussia. 
Two independent Soviet Republics, Khorezm and 
Bukhara, which are not Socialist Republics, but People¹s 
Soviet Republics, remain for the time being outside this 
union solely and exclusively because these republics are 
not yet socialist. I have no doubt, comrades, and I 
hope that you too have no doubt, that, as they develop 
internally towards socialism, these republics will also 
join the union state which is now being formed. 
It might seem to be more expedient for the R.S.F.S.R. 
not to join the Union of Republics as an integral federal 
unit, but that the republics comprising it should join 
individually, for which purpose it would evidently be 
necessary to dissolve the R.S.F.S.R. into its component 
parts. I think that this way would be irrational and 
inexpedient, and that it is precluded by the very course 
of the campaign. First, the effect would be that, parallel 
with the process that is leading to the union of the republics, 
we would have a process of disuniting the already

THE UNION OF THE SOVIET REPUBLICS 155 
existing federal units, a process that would upset the 
truly revolutionary process of union of the republics 
which has already begun. Secondly, if we took this wrong 
road we would arrive at a situation in which we would 
have to separate out of the R.S.F.S.R., in addition to 
the eight autonomous republics, a specifically Russian 
Central Executive Committee and a Russian Council 
of People¹s Commissars, and this would lead to considerable 
organisational perturbations, which are entirely 
unnecessary and harmful at the present time, and which 
are not in the least demanded by either the internal or 
external situation. That is why I think that the parties 
to the formation of the union should be the four Republics: 
the R.S.F.S.R., the Transcaucasian Federation, the 
Ukraine, and Byelorussia. 
The treaty of union must be based on the following 
principles: Commissariats of Foreign Trade, Military and 
Naval Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Transport, and Posts and 
Telegraphs shall be set up only within the Council of 
People¹s Commissars of the Union. The People¹s Commissariats 
of Finance, National Economy, Food, Labour, 
and State Inspection shall continue to function within 
each of the contracting republics, with the proviso that 
they operate in accordance with the instructions of the 
corresponding central Commissariats of the Union. This 
is necessary in order that the forces of the labouring 
masses of the republics may be united under the direction 
of the Union centre as regards food supply, the Supreme 
Council of National Economy, the People¹s Commissariat 
of Finance, and the People¹s Commissariat of 
Labour. Lastly, the remaining Commissariats, i.e., the 
Commissariats of Internal Affairs, Justice, Education,

J. V. S T A L I N 156 
Agriculture, and so on‹there are six in all‹which are 
directly connected with the manner of life, customs, 
special forms of land settlement, special forms of legal procedure, 
and with the language and culture of the peoples 
forming the republics, must be left as independent Commissariats 
under the control of the Central Executive 
Committees and Councils of People¹s Commissars of the 
contracting republics. This is necessary in order to provide 
a real guarantee of freedom of national development 
for the peoples of the Soviet republics. 
Such, in my opinion, are the principles that must 
be made the basis of the treaty that is shortly to be 
signed between our republics. 
Accordingly, I move the following draft resolution, 
which has been approved by the Presidium of the All- 
Russian Central Executive Committee: 
1. The union of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet 
Republic, the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, the Transcaucasian 
Socialist Federative Soviet Republic and the Byelorussian 
Socialist Soviet Republic into a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
is to be regarded as opportune. 
2. The union is to be based on the principle of voluntary consent 
and equal rights of the republics, each of which shall retain 
the right freely to secede from the Union of Republics. 
3. The delegation from the R.S.F.S.R., in collaboration with 
the delegations from the Ukraine, the Transcaucasian Republic 
and Byelorussia, is to be instructed to draft a declaration on the 
formation of the Union of Republics, setting forth the considerations 
which dictate the union of the republics into a single union 
state. 
4. The delegation is to be instructed to draw up the terms on 
which the R.S.F.S.R. is to enter the Union of Republics and 
when examining the treaty of union, is to adhere to the following 
principles:

THE UNION OF THE SOVIET REPUBLICS 157 
a) the formation of the appropriate Union legislative and 
executive organs; 
b) the merging of the Commissariats of Military and Naval 
Aff a i r s , Transport, Foreign Aff a i r s , Foreign Trade, and 
Posts and Telegraphs; 
c) the subordination of the Commissariats of Finance, Food, 
National Economy, Labour, and Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection 
of the contracting republics to the instructions of the corresponding 
Commissariats of the Union of Republics; 
d) complete guarantee of national development for the peoples 
belonging to the contracting republics. 
5. The draft treaty is to be submitted for the approval of the 
All-Russian Central Executive Committee represented by its 
Presidium before it is submitted to the First Congress of the Union 
of Republics. 
6. On the basis of the approval of the terms of union by the 
All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the delegation is to 
be empowered to conclude a treaty between the R.S.F.S.R. and 
the Socialist Soviet Republics of the Ukraine, Transcaucasia and 
Byelorussia for the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics. 
7. The treaty is to be submitted for ratification to the First 
Congress of the Union of Republics. 
Such is the draft resolution I submit for your consideration. 
Comrades, since the Soviet republics were formed, 
the states of the world have split into two camps: the 
camp of socialism and the camp of capitalism. In the 
camp of capitalism there are imperialist wars, national 
strife, oppression, colonial slavery and chauvinism. In 
the camp of the Soviets, the camp of socialism, there 
are, on the contrary, mutual confidence, national equality 
of rights and the peaceful co-existence and fraternal 
co-operation of peoples. Capitalist democracy has been 
striving for decades to eliminate national contradictions

J. V. S T A L I N 158 
by combining the free development of nationalities 
with the system of exploitation. So far it has not succeeded, 
and it will not succeed. On the contrary, the skein 
of national contradictions is becoming more and more 
entangled, threatening capitalism with death. Here 
alone, in the world of the Soviets, in the camp of socialism, 
has it been possible to eradicate national oppression and 
to establish mutual confidence and fraternal co-operation 
between peoples. And only after the Soviets succeeded 
in doing this did it become possible for us to build up our 
federation and to defend it against the attack of the enemies, 
both internal and external. 
Five years ago the Soviet power succeeded in laying 
the foundation for the peaceful co-existence and fraternal 
co-operation of peoples. Now, when we here are deciding 
the question of the desirability and necessity of 
union, the task before us is to erect on this foundation 
a new edifice by forming a new and mighty union state 
of the working people. The will of the peoples of our 
republics, who recently assembled at their congresses 
and unanimously resolved to form a Union of Republics, 
is incontestable proof that the cause of union is on the 
right road, that it is based on the great principle of 
voluntary consent and equal rights for nations. Let us 
hope, comrades, that by forming our Union Republic 
we shall create a reliable bulwark against international 
capitalism, and that the new Union State will be another 
decisive step towards the union of the working people of 
the whole world into a World Soviet Socialist Republic. 
(Prolonged applause. The ³Internationale² is sung.)

THE FORMATION OF THE UNION 
OF THE SOVIET REPUBLICS 
Report Delivered at the First Congress 
of Soviets of the U.S.S.R.49 
December 30, 1922 
Comrades, this day marks a turning point in the history 
of the Soviet power. It places a landmark between 
the old period, now past, when the Soviet republics, 
although they acted in common, yet each followed its 
own path and was concerned primarily with its own 
preservation, and the new period, already begun, when 
an end is being put to the isolated existence of the Soviet 
republics, when the republics are being united into 
a single union state for a successful struggle against 
economic ruin, and when the Soviet power is concerned 
not only with its preservation, but with developing into 
an important international force, capable of influencing 
the international situation and of modifying it in 
the interests of the working people. 
What was the Soviet state five years ago? A small, 
scarcely noticeable entity, which evoked the derision 
of all its enemies and the pity of many of its friends. 
That was the period of wartime ruin, when the Soviet 
power relied not so much upon its own strength as upon 
the impotence of its opponents; when the enemies of the 
Soviet power, split into two coalitions, the Austro- 
German coalition and the Anglo-French coalition, were

J. V. S T A L I N 160 
engaged in mutual warfare and were not in a position 
to turn their weapons against the Soviet power. In the 
history of the Soviet power that was the period of wartime 
ruin. In the struggle against Kolchak and Denikin, 
however, the Soviet power created the Red Army and 
successfully emerged from the period of wartime 
ruin. 
Later, the second period in the history of the Soviet 
power began, the period of struggle against economic 
ruin. This period is by no means over yet, but it has 
already borne fruit, for during this period the Soviet 
power has successfully coped with the famine which afflicted 
the country last year. During this period we have 
witnessed a considerable advance in agriculture and a 
considerable revival of the light industries. Cadres of 
industrial leaders have already come to the fore and are 
the object of our hope and trust. But that is far from 
enough for the purpose of overcoming economic ruin. 
To vanquish and eliminate that ruin the forces of all 
the Soviet republics must be pooled; all the financial 
and economic potentialities of the republics must be 
concentrated on the task of restoring our basic industries. 
Hence the necessity for uniting the Soviet 
republics into a single union state. Today is the day of 
the union of our republics into a single state for the 
purpose of pooling all our forces for the restoration of our 
economy. 
The period of combating wartime ruin gave us the 
Red Army, one of the foundations of the existence of the 
Soviet power. The next period, the period of struggle 
against economic ruin, is giving us a new framework of 
state existence‹the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,

FORMATION OF THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS 161 
which will undoubtedly promote the work of restoring 
Soviet economy. 
What is the Soviet power now? A great state of the 
working people which evokes among our enemies not 
derision but the gnashing of teeth. 
Such are the results of the development of the Soviet 
power during the five years of its existence. 
But, comrades, today is not only a day for summing 
up, it is at the same time the day of triumph of the new 
Russia over the old Russia, the Russia that was the gendarme 
of Europe, the Russia that was the hangman of 
Asia. Today is the day of triumph of the new Russia, 
which has smashed the chains of national oppression, 
organised victory over capital, created the dictatorship 
of the proletariat, awakened the peoples of the East, 
inspires the workers of the West, transformed the Red 
Flag from a Party banner into a State banner, and rallied 
around that banner the peoples of the Soviet republics 
in order to unite them into a single state, the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics, the prototype of the future 
World Soviet Socialist Republic. 
We Communists are often abused and accused of being 
unable to build. Let the history of the Soviet power 
during these five years of its existence serve as proof 
that Communists are also able to build. Let today¹s 
Congress of Soviets, whose function it is to ratify the 
Declaration and Treaty of Union of the Republics that 
were adopted at the Conference of Plenipotentiary Delegations 
yesterday, let this Union Congress demonstrate 
to all who have not yet lost the ability to understand, 
that Communists are as well able to build the new as 
they are to destroy the old.

J. V. S T A L I N 162 
Here, comrades, is the Declaration that was adopted 
yesterday, at the Conference of Plenipotentiary Delegations.
50 I shall read it (see appendix No. 1). 
And here is the text of the Treaty that was adopted 
at the same conference. I shall read it (see appendix 
No. 2). 
Comrades, on the instructions of the Conference of 
Plenipotentiary Delegations of the Soviet Republics I 
move that you ratify the texts I have just read of the 
Declaration and Treaty on the Formation of the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics. 
Comrades, I propose that you adopt them with the 
unanimity characteristic of Communists, and thereby add 
a new chapter to the history of mankind. (Applause.)

CONCERNING THE QUESTION 
OF THE STRATEGY AND TACTICS 
OF THE RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS51 
This article is based on the lectures ³On the Strategy 
and Tactics of the Russian Communists² that I delivered 
at different times at the workers¹ club in the Presnya 
District and to the Communist group at the Sverdlov 
University.52 I have decided to publish it not only because 
I think it is my duty to meet the wishes of the 
Presnya and Sverdlov comrades, but also because it seems 
to me that the article itself will be of some use for our 
new generation of Party workers. I consider it necessary 
to say, however, that this article does not claim to present 
anything new in substance compared with what has 
already been said several times in the Russian Party 
press by our leading comrades. The present article must 
be regarded as a condensed and schematic exposition of 
the fundamental views of Comrade Lenin. 
I 
PRELIMINARY CONCEPTS 
1. TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORKING-CLASS MOVEMENT 
Political strategy, as well as tactics, is concerned 
with the working-class movement. But the workingclass 
movement itself consists of two elements: the objective 
or spontaneous element, and the subjective or conscious 
element. The objective, spontaneous element is

J. V. S T A L I N 164 
the group of processes that take place independently of 
the conscious and regulating will of the proletariat. The 
economic development of the country, the development 
of capitalism, the disintegration of the old regime, the 
spontaneous movements of the proletariat and of the 
classes around it, the conflict of classes, etc.‹all these 
are phenomena whose development does not depend on 
the will of the proletariat. That is the objective side of 
the movement. Strategy has nothing to do with those 
processes, for it can neither stop nor alter them; it can 
only take them into account and proceed from them. 
That is a field which has to be studied by the theory of 
Marxism and the programme of Marxism. 
But the movement has also a subjective, conscious 
side. The subjective side of the movement is the reflection 
in the minds of the workers of the spontaneous 
processes of the movement; it is the conscious and systematic 
movement of the proletariat towards a definite 
goal. It is this side of the movement that interests us 
because, unlike the objective side, it is entirely subject 
to the directing influence of strategy and tactics. Whereas 
strategy is unable to cause any change in the course 
of the objective processes of the movement, here, on the 
contrary, on the subjective, conscious side of the movement, 
the field of application of strategy is broad and 
varied, because strategy can accelerate or retard the 
movement, direct it along the shortest path or divert it 
to a more difficult and painful path, depending on the 
perfections or shortcomings of strategy itself. 
To accelerate or retard the movement, facilitate or 
hinder it‹such is the field and the limits within which 
political strategy and tactics can be applied.

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 165 
2. THE THEORY AND PROGRAMME 
OF MARXISM 
Strategy itself does not study the objective processes 
of the movement. Nevertheless, it must know them and 
take them into account correctly if gross and fatal errors 
in the leadership of the movement are to be avoided. The 
objective processes of the movement are studied, in the 
first place, by the theory of Marxism and also by the programme 
of Marxism. Hence, strategy must base itself 
entirely on the data provided by the theory and programme 
of Marxism. 
From a study of the objective processes of capitalism 
in their development and decline, the theory of Marxism 
arrives at the conclusion that the fall of the bourgeoisie 
and the seizure of power by the proletariat are inevitable, 
that capitalism must inevitably give way to socialism. 
Proletarian strategy can be called truly Marxist only 
when its operations are based on this fundamental conclusion 
of the theory of Marxism. 
Proceeding from the data of theory, the programme 
of Marxism determines the aims of the proletarian movement, 
which are scientifically formulated in the points 
of the programme. The programme may be designed to 
cover the whole period of capitalist development and 
have in view the overthrow of capitalism and the organisation 
of socialist production, or only one definite phase 
of the development of capitalism, for instance, the overthrow 
of the survivals of the feudal-absolutist system and 
the creation of conditions for the free development of 
capitalism. Accordingly, the programme may consist 
of two parts: a maximum and a minimum. I t goes 
without saying that strategy designed for the minimum

J. V. S T A L I N 166 
part of the programme is bound to differ from strategy 
designed for the maximum part; and strategy can be 
called truly Marxist only when it is guided in its operations 
by the aims of the movement as formulated in 
the programme of Marxism. 
3. STRATEGY 
The most important function of strategy is to determine 
the main direction which ought to be taken by the 
working-class movement, and along which the proletariat 
can most advantageously deliver the main blow at 
its enemy in order to achieve the aims formulated in the 
programme. A strategic plan is a plan of the organisation 
of the decisive blow in the direction in which the 
blow is most likely to achieve the maximum results. 
The principal features of political strategy could 
easily be described by drawing an analogy with military 
strategy: for instance, in the fight against Denikin during 
the Civil War. Everybody remembers the end of 1919, 
when Denikin¹s forces were standing near Tula. At that 
time an interesting dispute arose among our military 
men about the point from which the decisive blow at 
Denikin¹s armies should be delivered. Some military 
men proposed that the line Tsaritsyn-Novorossiisk be 
chosen for the main direction of the blow. Others, on the 
contrary, proposed that the decisive blow be delivered 
along the line Voronezh-Rostov, to proceed along this 
line and thus cut Denikin¹s armies in two and then crush 
each part separately. The first plan undoubtedly had its 
merits in that it provided for the capture of Novorossiisk, 
which would have cut off the retreat of Denikin¹s

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 167 
armies. But, on the one hand, it was faulty because it 
assumed our advance through districts (the Don Region) 
which were hostile to Soviet power, and thus would 
have involved heavy casualties; on the other hand, it 
was dangerous because it opened for Denikin¹s armies 
the road to Moscow via Tula and Serpukhov. The only 
correct plan for the main blow was the second one, 
because, on the one hand, it assumed the advance of 
our main group through districts (Voronezh Gubernia- 
Donets Basin) which were friendly towards Soviet power 
and, therefore, would not involve any considerable casualties; 
on the other hand, it would disrupt the operations 
of Denikin¹s main group of forces which were moving 
towards Moscow. The majority of the military men 
declared in favour of the second plan, and this determined 
the fate of the war against Denikin. 
In other words, determining the direction of the main 
blow means deciding in advance the nature of operations 
during the whole period of the war, i.e., deciding 
in advance, to the extent of nine-tenths, the fate of 
the whole war . That is the function of strategy. 
The same must be said about political strategy. The 
first serious, collision between the political leaders of 
the Russian proletariat on the question of the main direction 
of the proletarian movement took place at the 
beginning of the twentieth century, during the Russo- 
Japanese war. At that time, as we know, one section 
of our Party (the Mensheviks) held the view that the 
main direction of the proletarian movement in its struggle 
against tsarism should be along the line of a bloc between 
the proletariat and the liberal bourgeoisie; the peasantry 
was omitted, or almost entirely omitted from the plan

J. V. S T A L I N 168 
as a major revolutionary factor, while the leading role 
in the general revolutionary movement was assigned to 
the liberal bourgeoisie. The other section of the Party 
(the Bolsheviks) maintained, on the contrary, that the 
main blow should proceed along the line of a bloc between 
the proletariat and the peasantry, and that the leading 
role in the general revolutionary movement should be 
assigned to the proletariat, while the liberal bourgeoisie 
should be neutralised. 
If, by analogy with the war against Denikin, we depict 
our whole revolutionary movement, from the beginning 
of this century to the February Revolution in 1917, as 
a war waged by the workers and peasants against tsarism 
and the landlords, it will be clear that the fate of tsarism 
and of the landlords largely depended upon which of the 
two strategic plans (the Menshevik or the Bolshevik) would 
be adopted, and upon which direction would be chosen 
as the main direction of the revolutionary movement. 
Just as during the war against Denikin military strategy, 
by deciding the main direction of the blow, determined 
to the extent of nine-tenths the character of all subsequent 
operations, including the liquidation of Denikin¹s 
armies, so here, in the sphere of the revolutionary struggle 
against tsarism, our political strategy, by deciding 
that the main direction of the revolutionary movement 
should follow the Bolshevik plan, determined the character 
of our Party¹s work during the whole period of the 
open struggle against tsarism, from the time of the Russo- 
Japanese war down to the February Revolution in 1917. 
The function of political strategy is, primarily, on 
the basis of the data provided by the theory and programme 
of Marxism, and taking into account the exper

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 169 
rience of the revolutionary struggle of the workers of all 
countries, correctly to determine the main direction of 
the proletarian movement of the given country in the 
given historical period.
4. TACTICS 
Tactics are a part of strategy, subordinated to and 
serving it. Tactics are not concerned with the war as a 
whole, but with its individual episodes, with battles 
and engagements. Strategy strives to win the war, or 
to carry through the struggle, against tsarism let us say, 
to the end; tactics, on the contrary, strive to win particular 
engagements and battles, to conduct particular 
campaigns successfully, or particular operations, that 
are more or less appropriate to the concrete situation of 
the struggle at each given moment. 
A most important function of tactics is to determine 
the ways and means, the forms and methods of fighting 
that are most appropriate to the concrete situation at 
the given moment and are most certain to prepare the 
way for strategic success. Consequently, the operation 
and results of tactics must be regarded not in isolation, 
not from the point of view of their immediate effect, 
but from the point of view of the aims and possibilities 
of strategy. 
There are times when tactical successes facilitate 
the achievement of strategic aims. Such was the case, 
for instance, on the Denikin front at the end of 1919, 
when our troops liberated Orel and Voronezh, when the 
successes of our cavalry at Voronezh and of our infantry 
at Orel created a situation favourable for delivering the

J. V. S T A L I N 170 
blow at Rostov. Such was the case in August 1917 in 
Russia, when the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets came 
over to the side of the Bolsheviks and thereby created 
a new political situation, which subsequently facilitated 
the blow delivered by our Party in October. 
There are also times when tactical successes, brilliant 
from the point of view of their immediate effect 
but not corresponding to the strategic possibilities, create 
an ³unexpected² situation, fatal to the whole campaign. 
Such was the case with Denikin at the end of 1919 
when, carried away by the easy success of a rapid and striking 
advance on Moscow, he stretched his front from the 
Volga to the Dnieper, and thereby prepared the way for 
the defeat of his armies. Such was the case in 1920, during 
the war against the Poles, when, under-estimating the 
strength of the national factor in Poland, and carried 
away by the easy success of a striking advance, we undertook 
a task that was beyond our strength, the task of 
breaking into Europe via Warsaw, which rallied the 
vast majority of the Polish population against the Soviet 
forces and so created a situation which nullified the successes 
of the Soviet forces at Minsk and Zhitomir and 
damaged the Soviet Government¹s prestige in the West. 
Lastly, there are also times when a tactical success 
must be ignored and when tactical losses and reverses 
must be deliberately incurred in order to ensure future 
strategic gains. This often happens in time of war, when 
one side, wishing to save its army cadres and to withdraw 
them from the onslaught of superior enemy forces, begins 
a systematic retreat and surrenders whole cities and regions 
without a fight in order to gain time and to muster 
its forces for new decisive battles in the future. Such was

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 171 
the case in Russia in 1918, during the German offensive, 
when our Party was forced to accept the Brest Peace, 
which was a tremendous setback from the point of view of 
the immediate political effect at that moment, in order 
to preserve the alliance with the peasants, who were 
thirsting for peace, to obtain a respite, to create a new 
army and thereby ensure strategic gains in the future. 
In other words, tactics must not be subordinated to 
the transient interests of the moment, they must not be 
guided by considerations of immediate political effect, 
still less must they desert firm ground and build castles 
in the air. Tactics must be devised in accordance with 
the aims and possibilities of strategy. 
The function of tactics is primarily to determine‹ 
in accordance with the requirements of strategy, and 
taking into account the experience of the workers¹ revolutionary 
struggle in all countries‹the forms and methods 
of fighting most appropriate to the concrete situation 
of the struggle at each given moment. 
5. FORMS OF STRUGGLE 
The methods of warfare, the forms of war, are not 
always the same. They change in accordance with the 
conditions of development, primarily, in accordance with 
the development of production. In the time of Genghis 
Khan the methods of warfare were different from those 
in the time of Napoleon III; in the twentieth century they 
are different from those in the nineteenth century. 
The art of war under modern conditions consists in 
mastering all forms of warfare and all the achievements 
of science in this sphere, utilising them intelligently,

J. V. S T A L I N 172 
combining them skilfully, or making timely use of one 
or another of these forms as circumstances require. 
The same must be said about the forms of struggle 
in the political sphere. The forms of struggle in the political 
sphere are even more varied than the forms of 
warfare. They change in accordance with the development 
of economic life, social life and culture, with the condition 
of classes, the relation of the contending forces, 
the kind of government and, finally, with international 
relations, and so forth. The illegal form of struggle under 
absolutism, combined with partial strikes and workers¹ 
demonstrations; the open form of struggle when ³legal 
possibilities² exist, and workers¹ mass political strikes; 
the parliamentary form of struggle at the time, say, of 
the Duma, and extra-parliamentary mass action which 
sometimes develops into armed uprising; lastly, state 
forms of struggle, after the proletariat has taken power 
and obtains the opportunity to utilise all the resources 
and forces of the state, including the army‹such, in 
general, are the forms of struggle that are brought to 
the fore by the practical experience of the revolutionary 
struggle of the proletariat. 
It is the task of the Party to master all forms of 
struggle, to combine them intelligently on the battlefield 
and skilfully to intensify the struggle in those forms 
which are specially suitable in the given situation. 
6. FORMS OF ORGANISATION 
The forms of organisation of armies and the different 
arms of the service are usually adapted to the forms 
and methods of warfare. When the latter change, the

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 173 
former change. In a war of manoeuvre the issue is often 
decided by massed cavalry. In positional warfare, on the 
contrary, cavalry plays either no part at all, or plays 
a subordinate part; heavy artillery and aircraft, gas and 
tanks decide everything. 
The task of the art of war is to ensure having all arms 
of the service, bring them to perfection and skilfully 
combine their operations. 
The same can be said about the forms of organisation 
in the political sphere. Here, as in the military sphere, 
the forms of organisation are adapted to the forms of 
the struggle. Secret organisations of professional revolutionaries 
in the period of absolutism; educational, tradeunion, 
co-operative and parliamentary organisations (the 
Duma group, etc.) in the period of the Duma; factory 
and workshop committees, peasant committees, strike 
committees, Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies, 
revolutionary military committees, and a broad proletarian 
party which unites all these forms of organisation, 
in the period of mass action and insurrection; finally, 
the state form of organisation of the proletariat in the 
period when power is concentrated in the hands of the 
working class‹such, in general, are the forms of organisation 
on which, under certain conditions, the proletariat 
can and must rely in its struggle against the bourgeoisie. 
The task of the Party is to master all these forms of 
organisation, bring them to perfection and skilfully combine 
their operations at each given moment.

7. THE SLOGAN. THE DIRECTIVE 
Skilfully formulated decisions which express the aims 
of the war, or of individual engagements, and which are 
popular among the troops, are sometimes of decisive 
importance at the front as a means of inspiring the army 
to action, of maintaining its morale, and so forth. Appropriate 
orders, slogans, or appeals to the troops are as 
important for the whole course of a war as first-class 
heavy artillery, or first-class fast-moving tanks. 
Slogans are still more important in the political 
sphere, when one has to deal with tens and hundreds of 
millions of the population, with their diverse demands 
and requirements. 
A slogan is a concise and clear formulation of the aims 
of the struggle, near or remote, given by the leading 
group, let us say, of the proletariat, by its party. Slogans 
vary in accordance with the different aims of the struggle, 
aims embracing either a whole historical period or individual 
stages and episodes of the given historical period. 
The slogan ³Down with the autocracy² which was first 
advanced by the ³Emancipation of Labour² group53 in 
the ¹eighties of the last century, was a propaganda 
slogan, since its aim was to win over to the Party individuals 
and groups of the most steadfast and sturdy fighters. 
In the period of the Russo-Japanese war, when the 
instability of the autocracy became more or less evident 
to large sections of the working class, this slogan became 
an agitation slogan, for it was designed to win over vast 
masses of the toilers. In the period just before the February 
Revolution of 1917, when tsarism had already become 
completely discredited in the eyes of the masses, the

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 175 
slogan ³Down with the autocracy² was transformed 
from an agitation slogan into an action slogan, since it 
was designed to move vast masses into the assault on 
tsarism. During the February Revolution this slogan 
became a Party directive, i.e., a direct call to seize 
certain institutions and certain positions of the tsarist 
system on a definite date, for it was already a matter 
of overthrowing and destroying tsarism. A directive is 
the Party¹s direct call for action, at a certain time and 
in a certain place, binding upon all members of the Party 
and, if the call correctly and aptly formulates the 
demands of the masses, and if the time is really ripe 
for it, it is usually taken up by the broad masses of the 
toilers. 
To confuse slogans with directives, or an agitation slogan 
with an action slogan, is as dangerous as premature 
or belated action, which is sometimes fatal. In April 
1917, the slogan ³All power to the Soviets² was an agitation 
slogan. The well-known demonstration which took 
place in Petrograd in April 1917 under the slogan ³All 
power to the Soviets,² and which surrounded the Winter 
Palace, was an attempt, premature and therefore fatal, 
to convert this slogan into an action slogan.54 That was 
a very dangerous example of the confusion of an agitation 
slogan with an action slogan. The Party was right when 
it condemned the initiators of this demonstration, for 
it knew that the conditions necessary for the transformation 
of this slogan into an action slogan had not yet arisen, 
and that premature action on the part of the proletariat 
might result in the defeat of its forces. 
On the other hand, there are cases when the Party 
is faced with the necessity of cancelling or changing

J. V. S T A L I N 176 
³overnight² an adopted slogan (or directive) for which 
the time is ripe, in order to guard its ranks against a trap 
set by the enemy, or with the necessity of postponing 
the execution of the directive to a more favourable moment. 
Such a case arose in Petrograd in June 1917, when, 
because the situation had changed, the Central Committee 
of our Party ³suddenly² cancelled the workers¹ and 
soldiers¹ demonstration, which had been carefully prepared 
and fixed to take place on June 10. 
It is the Party¹s duty skilfully and opportunely to 
transform agitation slogans into action slogans, or action 
slogans into definite and concrete directives, or, if the 
situation demands it, to display the necessary flexibility 
and determination to cancel the execution of any given 
slogan in good time, even if it is popular and the time 
is ripe for it. 
II 
THE STRATEGIC PLAN 
1. HISTORIC TURNS. STRATEGIC PLANS 
The Party¹s strategy is not something constant, 
fixed once and for all. It alters in accordance with the 
turns in history, with historic changes. These alterations 
in strategy find expression in the fact that with each 
separate turn in history a separate strategic plan is 
drawn up corresponding to that turn, and effective during 
the whole period from that turn to the next. The strategic 
plan defines the direction of the main blow to be delivered 
by the revolutionary forces and the corresponding 
disposition of the vast masses on the social front. Naturally, 
a strategic plan suitable for one period of his

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 177 
tory, which has its own specific features, cannot be suitable 
for another period of history, which has entirely 
different specific features. Corresponding to each turn 
in history is the strategic plan essential for it and adapted 
to its tasks. 
The same may be said about the conduct of war. The 
strategic plan that was drawn up for the war against 
Kolchak could not have been suitable for the war against 
Denikin, which called for a new strategic plan, which, 
in its turn, would not have been suitable for, say, the 
war against the Poles in 1920, because the direction of 
the main blows, as well as the disposition of the main 
fighting forces, could not but be different in each of 
these three cases. 
The recent history of Russia knows of three main historic 
turns, which gave rise to three different strategic 
plans in the history of our Party. We consider it necessary 
to describe them briefly in order to show how the 
Party¹s strategic plans in general change in conformity 
with new historic changes. 
2. THE FIRST HISTORIC TURN AND THE COURSE 
TOWARDS THE BOURGEOIS-DEMOCRATIC 
REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA 
This turn began at the beginning of the present century, 
in the period of the Russo-Japanese war, when the 
defeat of the tsar¹s armies and the tremendous political 
strikes of the Russian workers stirred up all classes of 
the population and pushed them into the arena of the 
political struggle. This turn came to an end in the days 
of the February Revolution in 1917.

J. V. S T A L I N 178 
During this period two strategic plans were at issue 
in our Party: the plan of the Mensheviks (Plekhanov- 
Martov, 1905), and the plan of the Bolsheviks (Comrade 
Lenin, 1905). 
The Menshevik strategy planned the main blow at 
tsarism along the line of a coalition between the liberal 
bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Proceeding from the fact 
that at that time the revolution was regarded as a bourgeois 
revolution, this plan assigned the hegemony (leadership) 
of the movement to the liberal bourgeoisie and 
doomed the proletariat to the role of ³extreme left opposition,² 
to the role of ³prompter² to the bourgeoisie, 
while the peasantry, one of the major revolutionary forces, 
was entirely, or almost entirely, left out of account. 
It is easy to understand that since this plan left out of 
account the millions of peasants in a country like Russia 
it was hopelessly utopian, and since it placed the fate 
of the revolution in the hands of the liberal bourgeoisie 
(the hegemony of the bourgeoisie) it was reactionary, for 
the liberal bourgeoisie was not interested in achieving 
the complete victory of the revolution, it was always 
ready to end the matter by a deal with tsarism. 
The Bolshevik strategy (see Comrade Lenin¹s book Two 
Tactics55) planned the revolution¹s main blow at tsarism 
along the line of a coalition between the proletariat and 
the peasantry, while the liberal bourgeoisie was to be 
neutralised. Proceeding from the fact that the liberal 
bourgeoisie was not interested in the complete victory 
of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, that it preferred 
a deal with tsarism at the expense of the workers and 
peasants to the victory of the revolution, this plan assigned 
the hegemony of the revolutionary movement to

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 179 
the proletariat as the only completely revolutionary class 
in Russia. This plan was remarkable not only because it 
took into account correctly the driving forces of the 
revolution, but also because it contained in embryo the 
idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat (the hegemony 
of the proletariat), because it brilliantly foresaw the next, 
higher phase of the revolution in Russia and facilitated 
the transition to it. 
The subsequent development of the revolution right 
up to February 1917 fully confirmed the correctness of 
this strategic plan. 
3. THE SECOND HISTORIC TURN AND 
THE COURSE TOWARDS THE DICTATORSHIP 
OF THE PROLETARIAT IN RUSSIA 
The second turn began with the February Revolution 
in 1917, after tsarism was overthrown, when the imperialist 
war had exposed the fatal ulcers of capitalism all over 
the world; when the liberal bourgeoisie, incapable of 
taking in its hands the actual government of the country, 
was compelled to confine itself to holding formal 
power (the Provisional Government); when the Soviets 
of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies, after getting actual 
power into their hands, had neither the experience nor 
the will to make the necessary use of it; when the soldiers 
at the front and the workers and peasants in the 
rear were groaning under the burdens of the war and economic 
disruption; when the ³dual power² and ³contact 
committee²56 regime, torn by internal contradictions and 
capable neither of waging war nor of bringing about 
peace, not only failed to find ³a way out of the impasse²

J. V. S T A L I N 180 
but confused the situation still more. This period ended 
with the October Revolution in 1917. 
Two strategic plans were at issue in the Soviets at 
that time: the Menshevik-Socialist-Revolutionary plan, 
and the Bolshevik plan. 
The Menshevik-Socialist-Revolutionary strategy, vacillating 
at first between the Soviets and the Provisional 
Government, between revolution and counter-revolution, 
took final shape at the time of the opening of 
the Democratic Conference (September 1917). It took 
the line of the gradual but steady removal of the Soviets 
from power and the concentration of all power in the 
country in the hands of the ³Pre-parliament,² the prototype 
of a future bourgeois parliament. The questions 
of peace and war, the agrarian and labour questions, 
as well as the national question, were shelved, pending 
the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, which, in 
its turn, was postponed for an indefinite period. ³All 
power to the Constituent Assembly²‹this was how the 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks formulated 
their strategic plan. It was a plan for the preparation of 
a bourgeois dictatorship, a combed and brushed-up, ³perfectly 
democratic² dictatorship it is true, but a bourgeois 
dictatorship for all that. 
The Bolshevik strategy (see Comrade Lenin¹s ³Theses,² 
published in April 191757) planned the main blow 
along the line of liquidating the power of the bourgeoisie 
by the combined forces of the proletariat and the 
poor peasants, along the line of organising the dictatorship 
of the proletariat in the shape of a Soviet Republic. 
Rupture with imperialism and withdrawal from the war; 
liberation of the oppressed nationalities of the former

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 181 
Russian Empire; expropriation of the landlords and capitalists; 
preparation of the conditions for organising socialist 
economy‹such were the elements of the Bolsheviks¹ 
strategic plan in that period. ³All power to the 
Soviets²‹this was how the Bolsheviks then formulated 
their strategic plan. This plan was important not only 
because it took into account correctly the actual driving 
forces of the new, proletarian revolution in Russia, but also 
because it facilitated and accelerated the unleashing of 
the revolutionary movement in the West. 
Subsequent developments right up to the October 
Revolution fully confirmed the correctness of this strategic 
plan. 
4. THE THIRD HISTORIC TURN 
AND THE COURSE TOWARDS THE PROLETARIAN 
REVOLUTION IN EUROPE 
The third turn began with the October Revolution, 
when the mortal combat between the two imperialist 
groups in the West had reached its climax; when the 
revolutionary crisis in the West was obviously growing; 
when the bourgeois government in Russia, bankrupt and 
entangled in contradictions, fell under the blows of the 
proletarian revolution; when the victorious proletarian 
revolution broke with imperialism and withdrew from 
the war, and thereby made bitter enemies in the shape of 
imperialist coalitions in the West; when the new Soviet 
Government¹s decrees on peace, the confiscation of the 
landlords¹ land, the expropriation of the capitalists and 
the liberation of the oppressed nationalities earned for 
it the confidence of millions of toilers throughout the 
world. This was a turn on an international scale, because,

J. V. S T A L I N 182 
for the first time, the international front of capital was 
breached, the question of overthrowing capitalism was 
for the first time put on a practical footing. This transformed 
the October Revolution from a national, Russian 
force into an international force, and the Russian workers 
from a backward detachment of the international 
proletariat into its vanguard, which by its devoted struggle 
rouses the workers of the West and the oppressed 
countries of the East. This turn has not yet come to the 
end of its development, for it has not yet developed on 
an international scale, but its content and general direction 
are already sufficiently clear. 
Two strategic plans were at issue in political circles 
in Russia at that time: the plan of the counter-revolutionaries, 
who had drawn into their organisations the active 
sections of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, 
and the plan of the Bolsheviks. 
The counter-revolutionaries and active Socialist-Revolutionaries 
and Mensheviks planned along the line 
of uniting in one camp all the discontented elements: 
the old army officers in the rear and at the front, the 
bourgeois-nationalist governments in the border regions, 
the capitalists and landlords who had been expropriated 
by the revolution, the agents of the Entente who were 
preparing for intervention, and so forth. They steered 
a course towards the overthrow of the Soviet Government 
by means of revolts or foreign intervention, and the restoration 
of the capitalist order in Russia. 
The Bolsheviks, on the contrary, planned along the 
line of internally strengthening the dictatorship of the 
proletariat in Russia and extending the sphere of operation 
of the proletarian revolution to all countries of the

CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY AND TACTICS 183 
world by combining the efforts of the proletarians of 
Russia with the efforts of the proletarians of Europe 
and with the efforts of the oppressed nations of the East 
against world imperialism. Highly noteworthy is the 
exact and concise formulation of this strategic plan 
given by Comrade Lenin in his pamphlet The Proletarian 
Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky, namely: 
³To do the utmost possible in one country (one¹s own‹ 
J. St.) for the development, support and awakening of the 
revolution in all countries.² The value of this strategic 
plan lies not only in that it took into account correctly 
the driving forces of the world revolution, but also 
in that it foresaw and facilitated the subsequent process 
of transformation of Soviet Russia into the focus of attention 
of the revolutionary movement throughout the 
world, into the banner of liberation of the workers in 
the West and of the colonies in the East. 
The subsequent development of the revolution all 
over the world, and also the five years¹ existence of 
Soviet power in Russia, have fully confirmed the correctness 
of this strategic plan. The fact that the counterrevolutionaries, 
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, 
who made several attempts to overthrow the Soviet 
Government, are now emigres, while the Soviet Government 
and the international proletarian organisation are 
becoming the major instruments of the policy of the world 
proletariat, and other facts of this kind, are obvious 
testimony in favour of the Bolsheviks¹ strategic plan.

NATIONAL FACTORS IN PARTY 
AND STATE AFFAIRS 
Thesis for the Twelfth Congress 
of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), 
Approved by the Central Committee 
of the Party58 
I 
1. Already in the last century the development of 
capitalism revealed the tendency to internationalise the 
modes of production and exchange, to eliminate national 
isolation, to bring peoples into closer economic relations, 
and gradually to unite vast territories into a single 
connected whole. The further development of capitalism, 
the development of the world market, the establishment 
of the great sea and rail routes, the export of capital, 
and so on, still further strengthened this tendency and 
bound peoples of the most diverse types by the ties of 
international division of labour and all-round mutual 
dependence. In so far as this process was a reflection of 
the colossal development of productive forces, in so far 
as it helped to destroy national aloofness and the opposition 
of interests of the various peoples, it was and is 
a progressive process, for it is creating the material prerequisites 
for the future world socialist economic system. 
2. But this tendency developed in peculiar forms 
that were completely at variance with its intrinsic historical 
significance. The mutual dependence of peoples 
and the economic union of territories took place in the 
course of the development of capitalism not as a result 
of the co-operation of nations as entities with equal

NATIONAL FACTORS IN PARTY AND STATE AFFAIRS 185 
rights, but by means of the subjugation of some nations 
by others, by means of the oppression and exploitation 
of less developed nations by more developed nations. 
Colonial plunder and annexations, national oppression 
and inequality, imperialist tyranny and violence, colonial 
slavery and national subjection, and, finally, the 
struggle among the ³civilised² nations for domination 
over the ³uncivilised² peoples‹such were the forms 
within which the development of closer economic relations 
of peoples took place. For that reason we find that, 
side by side with the tendency towards union, there arose 
a tendency to destroy the forcible forms of such union, 
a struggle for the liberation of the oppressed colonies and 
dependent nationalities from the imperialist yoke. Since 
the latter tendency signified a revolt of the oppressed 
masses against imperialist forms of union, since it demanded 
the union of nations on the basis of co-operation 
and voluntary union, it was and is a progressive tendency, 
for it is creating the spiritual prerequisites for the 
future world socialist economy. 
3. The struggle between these two principal tendencies, 
expressed in forms that are natural to capitalism, 
filled the history of the multi-national bourgeois states 
during the last half-century. The irreconcilable contradiction 
between these tendencies within the framework 
of capitalist development was the underlying cause of 
the internal unsoundness and organic instability of the 
bourgeois colonial states. Inevitable conflicts: within 
such states and inevitable wars between them; the disintegration 
of the old colonial states and the formation of 
new ones; a new drive for colonies and a new disintegration 
of the multi-national states leading to a new

J. V. S T A L I N 186 
refashioning of the political map of the world‹such are 
the results of this fundamental contradiction. The break-up 
of the old Russia, of Austria-Hungary and of Turkey, on 
the one hand, and the history of such colonial states as 
Great Britain and the old Germany, on the other; and, lastly, 
the ³great² imperialist war and the growth of the revolutionary 
movement of the colonial and unequal nations‹ 
all these and similar facts clearly point to the instability 
and insecurity of the multi-national bourgeois states. 
Thus, the irreconcilable contradiction between the process 
of economic union of peoples and the imperialist methods 
of accomplishing this union was the cause of the inability, 
helplessness and impotence of the bourgeoisie in 
finding a correct approach to the solution of the national 
question. 
4. Our Party took these circumstances into account 
and based its policy in the national question on the right 
of nations to self-determination, the right of peoples 
to independent state existence. The Party recognised 
this inalienable right of nations from the moment it 
came into being, at its first congress (in 1898), when the 
contradictions of capitalism in connection with the national 
question were not yet fully and clearly defined. Later 
it invariably re-affirmed its national programme in 
special decisions and resolutions of its congresses and conferences, 
up to the October Revolution. The imperialist 
war, and the mighty revolutionary movement in the 
colonies to which it gave rise, only provided new confirmation 
of the correctness of the Party¹s decisions on the 
national question. The gist of these decisions is: 
a) emphatic repudiation of every form of coercion 
in relation to nationalities;

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
187 
b) recognition of the equality and sovereignty of 
peoples in determining their destinies; 
c) recognition of the principle that a durable union 
of peoples can be achieved only on the basis of co-operation 
and voluntary consent; 
d) proclamation of the truth that such a union can 
be realised only as the result of the overthrow of the 
power of capital. 
In the course of its work our Party never tired of 
advancing this programme of national liberation in opposition 
to the frankly oppressive policy of tsarism, and also 
to the half-hearted, semi-imperialist policy of the Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries. Whereas the tsarist 
Russification policy created a gulf between tsarism 
and the non-Russian nationalities of the old Russia, and 
whereas the semi-imperialist policy of the Mensheviks 
and Socialist-Revolutionaries caused the best elements 
among these nationalities to desert Kerenskyism, the 
liberation policy pursued by our Party won for it the 
sympathy and support of the broad masses among those 
nationalities in their struggle against tsarism and the 
imperialist Russian bourgeoisie. There can scarcely be 
any doubt that this sympathy and support was one of 
the decisive factors that determined the victory our 
Party achieved in the October days. 
5. The October Revolution gave practical effect to 
our Party¹s decisions on the national question. By overthrowing 
the power of the landlords and capitalists, 
the chief vehicles of national oppression, and by putting 
the proletariat in power, the October Revolution at one 
blow shattered the chains of national oppression, upset 
the old relations between peoples, struck at the root of 
NATIONAL FACTORS IN PARTY AND STATE AFFAIRS

J. V. S T A L I N 188 
the old national enmity, cleared the way for the co-operation 
of peoples, and won for the Russian proletariat 
the confidence of its brothers of other nationalities 
not only in Russia, but also in Europe and Asia. It scarcely 
needs proof that had it not won this confidence, the 
Russian proletariat could not have defeated Kolchak 
and Denikin, Yudenich and Wrangel. On the other hand, 
there is no doubt that the oppressed nationalities could 
not have achieved their liberation if the dictatorship 
of the proletariat had not been established in central 
Russia. National enmity and national conflicts are inevitable, 
unavoidable, as long as capital is in power, 
as long as the petty bourgeoisie, and above all the peasantry 
of the formerly ³dominant² nation, permeated as 
they are with nationalist prejudices, follow the capitalists; 
and, on the contrary, national peace and national 
freedom may be considered assured if the peasantry and 
the other petty-bourgeois sections of the population follow 
the proletariat, that is, if the dictatorship of the proletariat 
is assured. Hence, the victory of the Soviets 
and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat 
are the basis, the foundation, on which the fraternal 
co-operation of peoples within a single state union 
can be built up. 
6. But the results of the October Revolution are not 
limited to the abolition of national oppression and the 
creation of a basis for the union of peoples. In the course 
of its development the October Revolution also evolved 
the forms of this union and laid down the main lines 
for the union of the peoples in a single union state. In 
the first period of the revolution, when the labouring 
masses among the nationalities first began to feel that

NATIONAL FACTORS IN PARTY AND STATE AFFAIRS 189 
they were independent national units, while the threat 
of foreign intervention had not yet become a real danger, 
co-operation between the peoples did not yet have a fully 
defined, well-established form. During the Civil War 
and intervention, when the requirements of the military 
self-defence of the national republics came into the 
forefront, while questions of economic construction were 
not yet on the order of the day, co-operation took the 
form of a military alliance. Finally, in the post-war 
period, when questions of the restoration of the productive 
forces destroyed by the war came into the forefront, 
the military alliance was supplemented by an economic 
alliance. The union of the national republics into the 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics marks the concluding 
stage in the development of the forms of co-operation, 
which have now assumed the character of a military, economic 
and political union of peoples into a single, multinational, 
Soviet state. 
Thus, in the Soviet system the proletariat found the 
key to the correct solution of the national question, discovered 
the way to organise a stable multi-national state 
on the basis of national equality of rights and voluntary 
consent. 
7. But finding the key to the correct solution of the 
national question does not yet mean solving it fully 
and finally, does not yet mean giving the solution concrete 
and practical shape. In order to put into effect correctly 
the national programme advanced by the October 
Revolution, it is also necessary to surmount the obstacles 
which we have inherited from the past period of national 
oppression, and which cannot be surmounted at one 
stroke, in a short space of time.

J. V. S T A L I N 190 
This heritage consists, firstly, in the survivals of 
dominant-nation chauvinism, which is a reflection of the 
former privileged position of the Great Russians. These 
survivals still persist in the minds of our Soviet officials, 
both central and local; they are entrenched in 
our state institutions, central and local; they are being 
reinforced by the ³new,² Smyena Vekh,59 Great-Russian 
chauvinist spirit, which is becoming stronger and stronger 
owing to the N.E.P. In practice they find expression 
in an arrogantly disdainful and heartlessly bureaucratic 
attitude on the part of Russian Soviet officials towards 
the needs and requirements of the national republics. 
The multi-national Soviet state can become really durable, 
and the co-operation of the peoples within it really 
fraternal, only if these survivals are vigorously and irrevocably 
eradicated from the practice of our state institutions. 
Hence, the first immediate task of our Party 
is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian 
chauvinism. 
This heritage consists, secondly, in the actual, i.e., 
economic and cultural, inequality of the nationalities 
of the Union of Republics. The legal national equality 
won by the October Revolution is a great gain for the 
peoples, but it does not in itself solve the whole national 
problem. A number of republics and peoples, which have 
not gone through, or had scarcely entered, the stage of 
capitalism, which have no proletariat of their own, 
or scarcely any, and which are therefore backward economically 
and culturally, are incapable of making full 
use of the rights and opportunities afforded them by 
national equality of rights; they are incapable of rising 
to a higher level of development and thus catching up

NATIONAL FACTORS IN PARTY AND STATE AFFAIRS 191 
with the nationalities which have forged ahead unless 
they receive real and prolonged assistance from outside. 
The causes of this actual inequality lie not only in the 
history of these peoples, but also in the policy pursued 
by tsarism and the Russian bourgeoisie, which strove 
to convert the border regions into areas producing nothing 
but raw materials and exploited by the industrially 
developed central districts. This inequality cannot be 
removed in a short space of time, this heritage cannot 
be eliminated in a year or two. The Tenth Congress of our 
Party already pointed out that ³the abolition of actual 
national inequality is a lengthy process involving a 
stubborn and persistent struggle against all survivals of 
national oppression and colonial slavery.²60 But to overcome 
it is absolutely necessary. And it can be overcome 
only by the Russian proletariat rendering the backward 
peoples of the Union real and prolonged assistance in 
their economic and cultural advancement. Otherwise there 
can be no grounds for expecting the establishment of 
proper and durable co-operation of the peoples within 
the framework of the single union state. Hence, the second 
immediate task of our Party lies in the struggle 
to abolish the actual inequality of the nationalities, the 
struggle to raise the cultural and economic level of the 
backward peoples. 
This heritage consists, lastly, in the survivals of nationalism 
among a number of nations which have borne 
the heavy yoke of national oppression and have not yet 
managed to rid their minds of old national grievances. 
These survivals find practical expression in a certain 
national aloofness and the absence of full confidence of 
the formerly oppressed peoples in measures proceeding

J. V. S T A L I N 192 
from the Russians. However, in some of the republics 
which consist of several nationalities, this defensive 
nationalism often becomes converted into aggressive 
nationalism, into blatant chauvinism on the part of a 
strong nationality directed against the weak nationalities 
of these republics. Georgian chauvinism (in Georgia) 
directed against the Armenians, Ossetians, Ajarians and 
Abkhazians; Azerbaijanian chauvinism (in Azerbaijan) 
directed against the Armenians; Uzbek chauvinism (in 
Bukhara and Khorezm) directed against the Turkmenians 
and Kirghiz‹all these forms of chauvinism, which, 
moreover, are fostered by the conditions of the N.E.P. and 
by competition, are a grave evil which threatens to convert 
some of the national republics into arenas of squabbling 
and bickering. Needless to say, all these phenomena 
hinder the actual union of the peoples into a single union 
state. In so far as the survivals of nationalism are a distinctive 
form of defence against Great-Russian chauvinism, 
the surest means of overcoming them lies in a 
vigorous struggle against Great-Russian chauvinism. In 
so far, however, as these survivals become converted 
into local chauvinism directed against the weak national 
groups in individual republics, it is the duty of Party 
members to wage a direct struggle against these survivals. 
Thus, the third immediate task of our Party is to 
combat nationalist survivals and, primarily, the chauvinist 
forms of these survivals. 
8. We must regard as one of the clear expressions 
of the heritage of the past the fact that a considerable 
section of Soviet officials in the centre and in the localities 
appraise the Union of Republics not as a union of 
state units with equal rights whose mission it is to guar

NATIONAL FACTORS IN PARTY AND STATE AFFAIRS 193 
antee the free development of the national republics, 
but as a step towards the liquidation of those republics, 
as the beginning of the formation of what is called the 
³one and indivisible.² Condemning this conception as 
anti-proletarian and reactionary, the congress calls upon 
members of the Party vigilantly to see to it that the union 
of the republics and the merging of the Commissariats 
are not utilised by chauvinistically-minded Soviet officials 
as a screen for their attempts to ignore the economic 
and cultural needs of the national republics. The merging 
of the Commissariats is a test for the Soviet apparatus: 
if this experiment were in practice to assume a dominantnation 
tendency, the Party would be compelled to adopt 
the most resolute measures against such a distortion, 
even to the extent of raising the question of annulling 
the merging of certain Commissariats until such time as 
the Soviet apparatus has been properly re-trained, so 
that it will pay genuinely proletarian and genuinely 
fraternal attention to the needs and requirements of the 
small and backward nationalities. 
9. Since the Union of Republics is a new form of coexistence 
of peoples, a new form of their co-operation 
within a single union state, from which the survivals 
described above must be eliminated in the course of the 
joint activities of the peoples, the supreme organs of the 
Union must be formed in such a way as fully to reflect 
not only the common needs and requirements of all the 
nationalities of the Union, but also the special needs and 
requirements of each individual nationality. Therefore, 
in addition to the existing central organs of the Union, 
which represent the labouring masses of the entire Union 
irrespective of nationality, a special organ should be

J. V. S T A L I N 194 
created representing the nationalities on the basis of equality. 
Such a structure of the central organs of the Union 
would make it fully possible to lend an attentive ear 
to the needs and requirements of the peoples, to render 
them the necessary aid in good time, to create an atmosphere 
of complete mutual confidence, and thus eliminate 
the above-mentioned heritage in the most painless way. 
10. On the basis of the above, the congress recommends 
that the members of the Party secure the accomplishment 
of the following practical measures: 
a) within the system of higher organs of the Union 
a special organ should be instituted that will represent 
all the national republics and national regions without 
exception on the basis of equality; 
b) the Commissariats of the Union should be constructed 
in such a way as to ensure the satisfaction of the 
needs and requirements of the peoples of the Union; 
c) the organs of the national republics and regions 
should be staffed mainly with people from among the 
local inhabitants who know the language, manner of 
life, habits and customs of the peoples concerned. 
II 
1. The development of our Party organisations in 
the majority of the national republics is proceeding 
under conditions not entirely favourable for their growth 
and consolidation. The economic backwardness of these 
republics, the small size of their national proletariat, 
the shortage, or even absence, of cadres of old Party workers 
belonging to the local population, the lack of serious 
Marxist literature in the native languages, the weak

NATIONAL FACTORS IN PARTY AND STATE AFFAIRS 195 
ness of Party educational work, and, further, the presence 
of survivals of radical-nationalist traditions, which have 
not yet been completely effaced, have given rise among 
the local Communists to a definite deviation towards 
overrating the specifically national features and underrating 
the class interests of the proletariat, to a deviation 
towards nationalism. This phenomenon is becoming 
particularly dangerous in republics where there are several 
nationalities, where, among the Communists of 
a stronger nationality, it frequently assumes the form 
of a deviation towards chauvinism directed against the 
Communists of the weak nationalities (Georgia, Azerbaijan, 
Bukhara, Khorezm). The deviation towards nationalism 
is harmful because, by hindering the process 
of liberation of the national proletariat from the ideological 
influence of the national bourgeoisie, it impedes 
the work of uniting the proletarians of the various nationalities 
into a single internationalist organisation. 
2. On the other hand, the presence both in the central 
Party institutions and in Communist Party organisations 
of the national republics of numerous cadres of 
old Party workers of Russian origin who are unfamiliar 
with the habits, customs and language of the labouring 
masses of these republics, and who for this reason 
are not always attentive to their requirements, has given 
rise in our Party to a deviation towards underrating 
the specifically national features and the national language 
in Party work, to an arrogant and disdainful attitude 
towards these specific features‹a deviation towards 
Great-Russian chauvinism. This deviation is harmful 
not only because, by hindering the formation of communist 
cadres from local inhabitants who know the national

J. V. S T A L I N 196 
language, it creates the danger that the Party may become 
isolated from the proletarian masses of the national 
republics, but also, and primarily, because it fosters and 
breeds the above-mentioned deviation towards nationalism 
and impedes the struggle against it. 
3. Condemning both these deviations as harmful 
and dangerous to the cause of communism, and drawing 
the attention of the Party members to the exceptional 
harmfulness and exceptional danger of the deviation 
towards Great-Russian chauvinism, the congress calls 
upon the Party speedily to eliminate these survivals of 
the past from our Party work. 
The congress instructs the Central Committee to 
carry out the following practical measures: 
a) to form advanced Marxist study circles among 
the local Party workers of the national republics; 
b) to develop a literature based on Marxist principles 
in the native languages; 
c) to strengthen the University of the Peoples of 
the East and its local branches; 
d) to establish under the Central Committees of the 
national Communist Parties groups of instructors recruited 
from among local Party workers; 
e) to develop a Party literature for the masses in the 
native languages; 
f) to intensify Party educational work in the republics;
g) to intensify work among the youth in the republics.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS 
OF THE R.C.P. (B.) 61 
April 17-25, 1923 
The Twelfth Congress of the 
Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). 
Verbatim Report, 
Moscow, 1923


1. THE ORGANISATIONAL REPORT 
OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 
April 17 
Comrades, I think that the Central Committee¹s 
report published in Izvestia of the Central Committee62 
is quite sufficient as far as details are concerned, and 
there is no need to repeat it here, in the Central Committee¹s 
organisational report. 
I think that the Central Committee¹s organisational 
report should consist of three parts. 
The first part should deal with the Party¹s organisational 
ties with the working class, with those ties and 
apparatuses of a mass character which surround the Party, 
and by means of which the Party exercises leadership of 
the working class, and the working class is transformed 
into the army of the Party. 
The second part of the report should, in my opinion, 
deal with those organisational ties and apparatuses of 
a mass character by means of which the working class is 
linked with the peasantry. This is the state apparatus. 
By means of the state apparatus the working class, led 
by the Party, exercises leadership of the peasantry. 
The third and last part should deal with the Party 
itself, as an organism living its own separate life, and 
as the apparatus which issues slogans and supervises 
their implementation.

J. V. S T A L I N 200 
I pass to the first part of the report. I speak of the 
Party as the vanguard, and of the working class as the 
army of our Party. It may seem from this analogy that 
the relations here are the same as in the military sphere, 
i.e., that the Party issues orders, that slogans are sent 
out by telegraph, and the army, i.e., the working class, 
carries out those orders. Such a view would be radically 
wrong. The point is that in the political sphere matters 
are much more complicated. In the military sphere, the 
commanders themselves create the army, they themselves 
enrol it. In the political sphere, however, the Party does 
not create its army, it finds it ready-made; that army 
is the working class. The second difference is that in the 
military sphere the commanders not only create the 
army, but provide it with food, clothing and footwear. 
That is not the case in the political sphere. The Party 
does not provide food, clothing and footwear for its army, 
the working class. For that very reason, matters are 
much more complicated in the political sphere. For that 
very reason, in the political sphere, it is not the class 
that depends upon the Party, but vice versa. That is 
why, in the political sphere, in order that the vanguard 
of the class, i.e., the Party, may exercise leadership, it 
must surround itself with a wide network of non-Party, 
mass apparatuses to serve as its feelers, by means of which 
it conveys its will to the working class, and the latter is 
converted from a diffuse mass into the army of the Party. 
And so I pass to an examination of these apparatuses, 
these transmission belts, which link the Party with the 
class, to see what these apparatuses are, and what the 
Party has succeeded in doing during the past year to 
strengthen them.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 201 
The first and principal transmission belt, the first 
and principal transmission apparatus by means of which 
the Party links itself with the working class, is the trade 
unions. During the past year of activity, as is shown by 
the figures dealing with what has been done to strengthen 
this principal transmission belt which connects the Party 
with the class, the Party has increased, has strengthened 
its influence in the leading bodies of the trade unions. 
I am not referring to the All-Union Central Council of 
Trade Unions. Everybody knows what its composition 
is. Nor am I referring to the Central Committees of 
the trade unions. I have in mind, chiefly, the Gubernia 
Trade-Union Councils. Last year, at the Eleventh Congress 
of our Party, 27 per cent of the chairmen of Gubernia 
Trade-Union Councils were Party members of pre- 
October standing; this year the figure is over 57 per cent. 
Not a very great achievement, but an achievement nevertheless. 
It shows that leading elements of our Party 
of pre-October standing hold in their hands the main 
threads of the unions with the aid of which they link the 
Party with the working class. 
I shall not deal with the composition of the workers¹ 
trade unions as a whole. The figures show that at the 
time of the last congress the total membership of the 
trade unions was about 6,000,000. This year, at the 
time of the present congress, the total membership is 
4,800,000. That looks like a step backward, but it only 
appears to be so. Last year‹permit me to tell the truth 
here!‹the union membership figures were inflated. The 
figures that were given did not correctly reflect the actual 
situation. The figures given at this congress, although 
smaller than last year¹s, are more real, and are

J. V. S T A L I N 202 
nearer the truth. I regard this as a step forward, in spite 
of the fact that the membership of the trade unions has 
diminished. Thus, the transformation of the trade unions 
from unreal and bureaucratic bodies into real live unions, 
having a common life with their leading bodies, on the 
one hand, and the increase in the percentage of leading 
Party elements in the Gubernia Trade-Union Councils 
from 27 per cent to 57 per cent on the other‹such is 
the success we have to record in our Party¹s activities 
in strengthening the trade unions during the past year. 
It cannot be said, however, that everything went 
well in this sphere. The primary units of the trade unions 
‹the factory committees‹are not yet ours everywhere. 
For example, of the 146 factory committees in the Kharkov 
Gubernia, 70 have not a single Communist in them. 
But such cases are rare. In general it must be admitted 
that the development of the trade unions, as regards the 
growth of the Party¹s influence in the gubernia and in 
the lower units, undoubtedly shows progress. This front 
can be regarded as secure for the Party. In the tradeunion 
sphere we have no strong opponents. 
The second transmission belt, the second transmission 
apparatus of a mass character by means of which the 
Party links itself with the class, is the co-operatives. 
First of all I have in mind the consumers¹ co-operatives, 
their working-class members; and then the rural co-operatives, 
those in which the rural poor are organised. At 
the time of the Eleventh Congress the workers¹ sections 
affiliated to the Centrosoyuz had a total membership of 
about 3,000,000. This year, at the time of the present 
congress, there is a slight increase: the total membership 
is 3,300,000. This is very little. But for all that, under

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 203 
present conditions, under the conditions of the N.E.P., 
it is a step forward. Counting three consumers in each 
worker¹s family, it works out that about 9,000,000 of 
the working-class population are organised as consumers 
in the consumers¹ co-operatives, in which our Party¹s 
influence is growing from day to day. . . . 
At the last congress we had no data about the size 
of the Party¹s forces in the consumers¹ co-operatives; 
2-3-5 per cent, not more. At the time of the present congress 
not less than 50 per cent of the members of the 
gubernia organs of the Centrosoyuz are Communists. This 
too is a step forward. 
The situation is not quite so good in the rural co-operatives. 
These co-operatives are certainly growing. Last 
year, at the time of the congress, not less than 1,700,000 
peasant households belonged to rural co-operatives. 
This year, at the time of the present congress, not less 
than 4,000,000 peasant households belong to them. 
These include a certain section of the rural poor, which 
gravitates towards the proletariat. Precisely for this 
reason it is of interest to ascertain to what extent the 
Party¹s influence has grown in the rural co-operatives. 
We have no figures for last year. This year, it appears 
(although it seems to me that the figures are doubtful), 
not less than 50 per cent of the members of the gubernia 
organs of the rural co-operatives are Communists. If 
that is true, it is a colossal step forward. The situation 
is not quite so good in the lower units; we are still unable 
to liberate the primary co-operative organisations from 
the influence of forces hostile to us. 
The third transmission belt which links the 
class with the Party is the Youth Leagues. The colossal

J. V. S T A L I N 204 
importance of the Youth League, and of the youth in general, 
for our Party¹s development scarcely needs proof. 
The figures we have at our disposal show that last year, at 
the time of the Eleventh Congress, the Youth League 
had a membership of not less than 400,000. Later, in 
the middle of 1922, when staffs were reduced, before the 
system of reserving places in the factories for young 
workers had been fully introduced, and before the Youth 
League had been able to adapt itself to the new conditions, 
the membership dropped to 200,000. Now, especially 
since last autumn, we have a colossal increase in 
the membership of the Youth League. It has a membership 
of not less than 400,000. The most welcome thing is 
that the increase is primarily due to the influx of young 
workers. The Youth Leagues are growing primarily in 
those districts where our industry is reviving. 
You know that the Youth League¹s chief activity 
among the workers lies in the factory apprenticeship 
schools. The relevant figures show that last year, at the 
time of the Eleventh Congress, we had about 500 factory 
apprenticeship schools, with a total of 44,000 pupils. 
By January of this year we had over 700 schools, with 
a total of 50,000 pupils. The main thing, however, is 
that the increase comes from working-class members of 
the Youth League. 
Like the previously mentioned front‹the rural cooperative 
front‹the youth front must be regarded as 
being under special threat because the attacks of our 
Party¹s enemies are specially persistent in this field. 
It is on these two fronts that the Party and its organisations 
must exert all efforts to secure predominating influence.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 205 
I pass next to the delegate meetings of working 
women. This, too, is for our organisations a, perhaps, 
inconspicuous, but very important, highly essential, transmission 
mechanism, which links our Party with workingclass 
women. The figures at our disposal show the following: 
last year, at the time of the Eleventh Congress, 
we had in 57 gubernias and three regions about 16,000 
women delegates, predominantly working women. This 
year, at the time of the present congress, in the same gubernias 
and regions, we have not less than 52,000 women 
delegates, of whom 33,000 are working women. This 
is a colossal step forward. It must be borne in mind that 
this is a front to which we have devoted little attention 
up till now, although it is of colossal importance for us. 
Since there is progress here, since there is a basis for 
strengthening this apparatus too, for extending and directing 
the Party¹s feelers with the object of undermining 
the influence of the priests among the youth whom 
these women are bringing up, it must naturally be one 
of the Party¹s immediate tasks to develop the maximum 
energy also on this front, which is undoubtedly in danger. 
I pass to the schools. I refer to the political schools, 
the Soviet-Party schools and the Communist Universities. 
These are also an apparatus with the aid of which 
the Party spreads communist education, trains the educational 
commanding personnel who sow the seeds of 
socialism, the seeds of communism, among the working 
population and thereby link the Party with the working 
class by spiritual ties. The figures show that last year 
about 22,000 students attended the Soviet-Party schools. 
This year there are not less than 33,000, counting also 
those attending the urban political education schools

J. V. S T A L I N 206 
that are financed by the Central Political Education 
Department. As regards the Communist Universities, 
which are of enormous importance for communist education, 
the increase is small: there were about 6,000 
students, now there are 6,400. The Party¹s task is to exert 
greater efforts on this front, to intensify activity in training, 
in forging commanding staffs for communist education. 
I pass to the press. The press is not a mass apparatus, 
a mass organisation, nevertheless, it establishes 
an imperceptible link between the Party and the working 
class, a link which is as strong as any mass transmission 
apparatus. It is said that the press is the sixth power. 
I do not know whether that is so or not, but that it is a 
potent one and carries great weight is beyond dispute. 
The press is a most powerful weapon by means of which 
the Party daily, hourly, speaks in its own language, the 
language it needs to use, to the working class. There are 
no other means of stretching spiritual threads-between 
the Party and the class, there is no other apparatus of 
equal flexibility. That is why the Party must pay special 
attention to this sphere, and it must be said that here 
we have already achieved some success. Take the newspapers. 
According to figures issued, last year we had 
380 newspapers; this year we have no less than 528. The 
total circulation last year was 2,500,000, but this was 
a semi-artificial, not a live circulation. Last summer, 
when subsidies to the press were reduced and the press 
was faced with the necessity of standing on its own 
feet, the circulation dropped to 900,000. At the time of 
the present congress we have a circulation of about 
2,000,000. Thus, it is becoming less artificial, the press

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 207 
is living on its own resources and is a sharp weapon 
in the hands of the Party; it gives it contact with the 
masses, otherwise the circulation could not increase and 
the increase be maintained. 
I pass to the next transmission apparatus‹the army. 
People are accustomed to regard the army as an apparatus 
of defence or attack. I, however, regard the army 
as a mustering centre of the workers and peasants. The 
history of all revolutions tells us that the army is the 
only mustering centre where workers and peasants from 
different gubernias, and who are strangers to one another, 
come together, and having come together, hammer 
out their political opinions. It is not by chance that 
big mobilisations and important wars always give rise 
to social conflicts, to mass revolutionary movements, of 
one kind or another. This occurs because it is in the 
army that peasants and workers from the most widely 
separated parts meet one another for the first time. Ordinarily, 
peasants from Voronezh do not meet Petrograd 
people, and men from Pskov never see men from Siberia; 
but in the army they do meet. The army is a school, 
a mustering centre of the workers and peasants, and 
from this point of view the Party¹s strength and influence 
in the army is of colossal importance, and in this 
respect the army is a tremendous apparatus that links 
the Party with the workers and the poor peasants. The 
army is the only mustering centre for the whole of Russia, 
for the entire federation, where people of different gubernias 
and regions come together, learn, and are drawn 
into political life. In this extremely important mass 
transmission apparatus the following changes have 
taken place: at the time of the last congress, Communists

J. V. S T A L I N 208 
in the army numbered 7.5 per cent; this year the figure 
has reached 10.5 per cent. During this period the army 
was reduced in size, but in quality it has improved. The 
Party¹s influence has grown; in this principal muster 
ing centre, too, we have achieved a victory as regards 
the growth of communist influence. 
Last year, of the commanding staff, taking the latter 
as a whole, down to platoon commanders, 10 per cent 
were Communists; this year 13 per cent are Communists. 
Excluding platoon commanders, the corresponding figures 
of the proportion of Communists among the commanding 
staff are: 16 per cent last year, and 24 per cent 
this year. 
Such are the transmission belts, the mass apparatuses, 
which surround our Party, and by linking it with 
the working class enable it to become a vanguard and 
the working class to become an army. 
Such is the network of connections and transmission 
points by means of which the Party, as distinct from a 
military commanding staff, is transformed into a vanguard, 
and the working class is transformed from a diffuse 
mass into a real political army. 
The successes shown by our Party in these spheres 
in strengthening these connections are due not only to 
the fact that the Party has grown in experience in this 
matter, and not only to the fact that the means of influencing 
these transmission apparatuses have been improved, 
but also to the fact that the general political 
state of the country has assisted, facilitated this. 
Last year we had the famine, the results of the famine, 
depression in industry, dispersion of the working 
class, and so forth. This year, on the contrary, we have

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 209 
had a good harvest, a partial revival of industry, a 
beginning of the process of the re-concentration of the 
proletariat, and an improvement in the conditions of 
the workers. The old workers who had been compelled 
earlier to disperse to the villages are coming back to the 
mills and factories, and all this is creating a favourable 
political situation for the Party to conduct extensive 
work in strengthening the above-mentioned connecting 
apparatuses. 
I pass to the second part of the report: concerning 
the Party and the state apparatus. The state apparatus 
is the chief mass apparatus linking the working class in 
power, represented by its party, with the peasantry, and 
which enables the working class, represented by its party, 
to lead the peasantry. I link this part of my report directly 
with the two well-known articles by Comrade Lenin.63 
It seemed to many people that the idea Comrade 
Lenin elaborated in those two articles is entirely new. 
I think that the idea that is elaborated in those articles 
is one with which Vladimir Ilyich was already pre-occupied 
last year. You no doubt remember the political 
report he made last year. He said that our policy was 
correct, but the apparatus was not working properly and, 
therefore, the car was not running in the right direction, 
it swerved. I remember that Shlyapnikov, commenting 
on this, said that the drivers were no good. That is wrong, 
of course, absolutely wrong. The policy is correct, the 
driver is excellent, and the type of car is good, it is a 
Soviet car, but some of the parts of the state car, i.e., 
some of the officials in the state apparatus, are bad, 
they are not our men. That is why the car does not run 
properly and, on the whole, we get a distortion of the

J. V. S T A L I N 210 
correct political line. We get not implementation but 
distortion. The state apparatus, I repeat, is of the right 
type, but its component parts are still alien to us, bureaucratic, 
half tsarist-bourgeois. We want to have a state 
apparatus that will be a means of serving the mass of the 
people, but some persons in this state apparatus want 
to convert it into a source of gain for themselves. That 
is why the apparatus as a whole is not working properly. 
If we fail to repair it, the correct political line by itself 
will not carry us very far; it will be distorted, and there 
will be a rupture between the working class and the peasantry. 
We shall have a situation in which, although we 
shall be at the steering wheel, the car will not obey. 
There will be a crash. These are the ideas Comrade Lenin 
elaborated as far back as a year ago, and which only 
this year he formulated in a harmonious system in the 
proposal to reorganise the Central Control Commission 
and the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection in such a 
way that the reorganised inspection apparatus should be 
transformed into a device for re-arranging all the parts 
of the car, for replacing the old useless parts with new 
ones, which must be done if we really want the car to go 
in the right direction. 
That is the essence of Comrade Lenin¹s proposal. 
I could mention a fact like the inspection of the 
Orekhovo-Zuyevo Trust, organised on Soviet lines, the 
function of which was to turn out the utmost quantity 
of manufactured goods to be supplied to the peasants, 
whereas this trust, organised on Soviet lines, delivered 
the goods it manufactured into private hands to the 
detriment of the state. The car was not going in the right 
direction.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 211 
I could mention the following fact, which Comrade 
Voroshilov told me the other day. We have an institution 
that is called the Industrial Bureau. There was an 
institution like that in the South-East. This apparatus 
had a staff of about 2,000. The function of this apparatus 
was to direct industry in the South-East. Comrade Voroshilov 
told me in despair that it was a difficult job 
to manage this apparatus, that to do so they had to set 
up an additional small apparatus, i.e., to manage the 
managing apparatus, Well, we found some good men: 
Voroshilov, Eismont and Mikoyan, who set about making 
a thorough investigation. And it turned out that instead 
of a staff of 2,000, one of 170 was enough. And what happened? 
It turns out that it is working much better than 
before. Formerly, the apparatus ate up all it produced. 
Now it is serving industry. A multitude of facts of this 
kind could be quoted, more than there are hairs on 
my head. 
All these facts point only to one thing, namely, that 
our Soviet apparatuses, although of the right type, are 
frequently staffed with people whose habits and traditions 
upset our essentially correct political line. That 
is why the whole mechanism is not working properly, and 
the result is a great political setback, the danger of a 
rupture between the proletariat and the peasantry. 
The matter stands as follows: either we improve the 
economic apparatuses, reduce their staffs, simplify 
them, make them cheaper to run, staff them with people 
who are akin to the Party in s p i r i t , and then we 
shall achieve the purpose for which we introduced the 
so-called N.E.P., i.e., industry will turn out the maximum 
quantity of manufactured goods to supply the

J. V. S T A L I N 212 
countryside and receive the produce it needs, and in 
this way we shall establish a bond between peasant 
economy and industrial economy; or we fail to do this, 
and there will be a crash. 
Or again: either the state apparatus itself, the taxcollecting 
apparatus, will be simplified, reduced, and 
the thieves and scoundrels driven out of it, and then 
we shall be able to take less from the peasants than we 
do now and the national economy will come through the 
strain; or this apparatus will become an end in itself, 
as was the case in the South-East, and all that is taken 
from the peasants will go to maintain the apparatus 
itself, and then there will be a political crash. 
These, I am convinced, are the considerations that 
guided Vladimir Ilyich when he wrote those articles. 
There is yet another side to Comrade Lenin¹s proposals. 
His aim is not only to improve the apparatus and 
to increase the Party¹s leading role in it to the utmost 
‹for the Party built the state and it is its duty to improve 
it; but evidently he also has in mind the moral 
side. His aim is that there should not be left in the country 
a single official, no matter how highly-placed, concerning 
whom the ordinary man might say: he is above 
the law. This moral aspect is the third aspect of Ilyich¹s 
proposal; it is precisely this proposal that sets the task 
of purging not only the state apparatus, but also the 
Party, of those traditions and habits of domineering 
bureaucrats which discredit our Party. 
I now pass to the question of choosing staffs, i.e., 
the question which Ilyich spoke about already at the 
Eleventh Congress. If it is clear to us that as regards 
its composition, habits and traditions our state appara

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 213 
tus is no good, and that this threatens to cause a rupture 
between the workers and the peasants, then it is 
clear that the Party¹s leading role must find expression 
not only in the issue of directives, but also in the appointment 
to certain posts of people who are capable 
of understanding our directives and capable of carrying 
them out honestly. That no impassable border-line can be 
drawn between the Central Committee¹s political work 
and its organisational work needs no proof. 
Hardly anyone of you would assert that it is enough 
to give a correct political line and the matter is finished. 
No, that is only half the matter. After a correct political 
line has been given it is necessary to choose staffs in such 
a way as to fill the various posts with people who are 
capable of carrying out the directives, able to understand 
the directives, able to accept these directives as their 
own and capable of putting them into effect. Otherwise 
the policy becomes meaningless, becomes mere gesticulation. 
That is why the Registration and Distribution 
Department, i.e., the organ of the Central Committee 
whose function it is to register our principal workers, 
at the bottom as well as at the top, and to distribute 
them, acquires immense importance. Until now this 
department has confined itself to registering and distributing 
comrades for Uyezd Committees, Gubernia 
Committees and Regional Committees. Beyond this, to 
put it bluntly, it did not stick its nose. Now that the 
war is over and there are no more mass, wholesale mobilisations, 
now that these have become quite purposeless‹
as was proved by the mobilisation of a thousand 
Party workers that was thrust upon the shoulders of the 
Central Committee last year, and which failed, because

J. V. S T A L I N 214 
under present conditions, when our work has become 
more thorough and we are steering towards specialisation, 
when the qualifications of every single individual 
must be thoroughly scrutinised, wholesale mobilisations 
only make things worse and the localities gain 
nothing from them‹now, the Registration and Distribution 
Department cannot confine itself to the Gubernia 
and Uyezd Committees. 
I could quote several figures. The Eleventh Congress 
instructed the Central Committee to mobilise not 
less than a thousand Moscow Party workers. The 
Central Committee registered for mobilisation about 
1,500. Owing to sickness and all sorts of other reasons, 
only 700 were mobilised; of these, according to the opinions 
expressed by the districts, 300 proved to be more 
or less suitable. Thus you have a fact which shows that 
the old type of wholesale mobilisation, such as was carried 
out in the past, is no longer suitable, because our 
Party work has become more thorough, it has become 
specialised for the different branches of the national 
economy, and to shift people about from place to place 
indiscriminately means, firstly, dooming them to idleness, 
and secondly, failing to satisfy even the minimum 
requirements of the organisations which demand new 
workers. 
I would like to quote a few figures from a study of 
our industrial commanding staffs given in the pamphlet64 
by Sorokin, who works in the Registration and Distribution 
Department. But before quoting these figures 
I must speak about the reform of this department which 
the Central Committee carried out in the course of its 
work on the registration of responsible workers. For

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 215 
merly, as I have already said, the Registration and 
Distribution Department confined itself to the Gubernia 
and Uyezd Committees. Now that our work has become 
more thorough and construction work is expanding everywhere, 
it must not confine itself to the Uyezd and 
Gubernia Committees. It must now cover all branches 
of the administration without exception, and the entire 
industrial commanding personnel by means of which 
the Party keeps control of our economic apparatus and 
exercises its leadership. With this in view, the Central 
Committee decided to enlarge the staffs of the Registration 
and Distribution Departments both at the centre 
and in the localities, so that their chiefs could have deputies 
for the economic and Soviet spheres respectively, 
and assistants to register commanding staffs according to 
factories, trusts and business organisations, local and 
central, in the Soviets and in the Party. 
The effect of this reform soon made itself felt. In 
a short space of time it was possible to register the industrial 
commanding staff, consisting of about 1,300 factory 
managers. Of these, 29 per cent are Party members 
and 70 per cent non-Party. It might seem that non-Party 
persons predominate in importance in the basic enterprises, 
but that is not true. It appears that the Communists, 
the 29 per cent, are managers of the largest enterprises 
which employ a total of over 300,000 workers, 
while the non-Party persons, the 70 per cent, are managers 
of enterprises which embrace not more than 250,000 
industrial workers. The small enterprises are managed 
by non-Party people, the big ones are managed by 
Party members. Further, among the managers who are 
Party members, those from the working class outnumber

J. V. S T A L I N 216 
the others by three to one. This shows that unlike the 
top of the industrial structure‹the Supreme Council 
of National Economy and its departments where there 
are few Communists, at the bottom, in the basic units, 
Communists, and primarily workers, have begun to take 
control of the enterprises. An interesting point is that as 
regards quality and suitability, there were more proficient 
factory managers among the Communists than 
among the non-Party people. This shows that in distributing 
Communists among the enterprises, the Party is 
guided not by purely Party considerations, not only 
by the aim of increasing the Party¹s influence in the 
enterprises, but also by practical considerations. Not 
only the Party as such, but the whole of our economic 
construction gains by this, for it turns out that there 
are far more proficient factory managers among the 
Communists than among the non-Party people. 
That, then, is the first experiment in registering 
our industrial commanding staff, a new experiment, 
which, as I have said, covers by no means all the enterprises, 
for the 1,300 factory managers registered in this 
pamphlet represent only about half the number of enterprises 
that still have to be registered. But the experiment 
shows that this is an inexhaustibly rich field, 
and that the work of the Registration and Distribution 
Department must be expanded to the utmost so as to 
enable the Party to staff the managements of our basic 
enterprises with Communists and thereby exercise its 
leadership of the state apparatus. 
The comrades are no doubt familiar with the proposals 
on the organisational question which the Central 
Committee is submitting for the consideration of the con

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 217 
gress, proposals concerning both the Party and the Soviet 
sides. As regards the Soviet side, about which I have 
just spoken in the second part of my report, the Central 
Committee proposes that this question be submitted 
for detailed discussion to a special committee, which 
should study both the Party and the Soviet sides of 
the question and then submit its findings to the congress. 
I pass to the third part of the report: on the Party 
as an organism, and the Party as an apparatus. 
First of all I must say a word or two about the numerical 
strength of our Party. The figures show that last 
year, at the time of the Eleventh Congress, the Party had 
a membership of several tens of thousands over 400,000. 
This year, owing to the subsequent reduction of the Party 
membership, to the fact that in a number of regions 
the Party rid itself of non-proletarian elements, the membership 
has become smaller, it is a little below 400,000. 
This is not a loss, but a gain, for the social composition 
of the Party has improved. The most interesting thing 
in our Party¹s development as regards the improvement 
in its social composition is that the former tendency of 
the non-proletarian elements in the Party to grow 
faster than the working-class element ceased in the year 
under review; there was a turn for the better, a definite 
swing was to be noted towards an increase in the percentage 
of the working-class element of the membership 
over the non-proletarian element. This is precisely the 
success we strove for before the purge, and which we have 
now achieved. I will not say that we have already done 
all that should be done in this sphere; that is far from 
being the case. But we have achieved a turn for the

J. V. S T A L I N 218 
better, we have achieved a certain minimum of uniformity, 
we have ensured the working-class composition of 
the Party, and evidently we shall have to continue this 
line of further reducing the non-proletarian elements 
in the Party and further increasing the proletarian elements. 
The measures by which the Central Committee 
proposes to achieve a further improvement in the Party 
membership are outlined in the Central Committee¹s 
proposals; I shall not repeat them. Evidently, we shall 
have to strengthen the barriers against an influx of nonproletarian 
elements, for at the present time, under the 
conditions of the N.E.P., when the Party is certainly 
exposed to the corrupting influence of N.E.P. elements, 
i t is necessary to achieve the utmost uniformity in 
our Party¹s membership, or, at all events, a decisive 
preponderance of working-class over non-working-class 
elements. The Party must do this, i t is its duty to 
do this, if it wants to remain the party of the working 
class. 
I pass to the question of the life and activities of 
the Gubernia Committees. Often a note of irony creeps 
into some of the articles published in the press about 
the Gubernia Committees; the latter are often ridiculed 
and their activities are underrated. I, however, must 
say, comrades, that the Gubernia Committees are the 
main bulwark of our Party, that without the Gubernia 
Committees, without their guidance of Soviet and Party 
work, the Party would have no ground to stand on. 
In spite of all their shortcomings, in spite of the defects 
they still suffer from, in spite of the so-called squabbling 
and wrangling in the Gubernia Committees, taken 
as a whole they are the main bulwark of our Party.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 219 
How are the Gubernia Committees living and developing? 
About ten months ago I read letters from Gubernia 
Committees showing that the secretaries of our Gubernia 
Committees were then still confused about economic 
matters, that they had not yet adapted themselves 
to the new conditions. I have also read letters written 
ten months later; I read them with pleasure, with joy, 
because it is evident from them that the Gubernia Committees 
have matured, they have got into their stride, 
they have taken up construction work in earnest, they 
have put the local budgets in order, they have taken 
control of local economic development, they have really 
managed to take the lead of the entire economic and 
political life of their respective gubernias. This, comrades, 
is a great gain. The Gubernia Committees undoubtedly 
have their defects, but I must say that if they 
had not gained this Party and economic experience, if 
there had not been this tremendous step forward in the 
sense of the growth of maturity of the Gubernia Committees 
in directing local economic and political life, we could 
not even dream of the Party ever undertaking the leadership 
of the state apparatus. 
There is talk about squabbling and friction in the 
Gubernia Committees. I must say that in addition to 
their bad sides, squabbling and friction have their good 
sides. The chief cause of the squabbling and wrangling 
is the effort of the Gubernia Committees to create within 
themselves a united, compact core capable of directing 
affairs smoothly. This aim and striving are quite healthy 
and legitimate, although they are often pursued by 
methods that are out of harmony with the aim. This is 
due to the diversity of our Party membership? to the fact

J. V. S T A L I N 220 
that we have in our Party old hands and new, proletarians 
and intellectuals, people from the centre and from 
the border districts, and people of various nationalities; 
and all these diverse elements in the Gubernia Committees 
introduce there diverse customs and traditions 
and this gives rise to friction and squabbling. For all 
that, although it assumes impermissible forms, ninetenths 
of this squabbling and friction is prompted by the 
healthy striving to create a solid core capable of directing 
the work. It needs no proof that if there were no such 
leading groups in the Gubernia Committees, if things 
were so arranged that the ³good² and the ³bad² counter-
balanced each other, there would be no leadership 
in the gubernias, the tax in kind would not be collected, 
and we would be unable to carry through any campaigns. 
Such is the healthy side of the squabbling, which must 
not be obscured by the fact that it sometimes assumes 
ugly forms. This does not mean, of course, that the Party 
must not combat squabbling, especially when it arises 
on personal grounds. 
That is how matters stand with the Gubernia Committees. 
Below the Gubernia Committees, however, the Party, 
unfortunately, is not yet as strong as it might appear 
to be. Our Party¹s chief weakness, as far as the apparatus 
is concerned, lies precisely in the weakness of 
our Uyezd Committees, in the absence of reserves, namely, 
of uyezd secretaries. I think that the reason why 
we have not yet taken complete control of the principal 
apparatuses which link our Party with the working 
class‹the apparatuses I spoke about in the first part 
of my report (I have in mind the lower Party units,

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 221 
the co-operatives, the women¹s delegate meetings, the 
Youth Leagues, etc.), the reason why the gubernia 
organs have not yet taken complete control of these 
apparatuses, is precisely that we are too weak in the 
uyezds. 
I think that this is a fundamental question. 
I think that one of our Party¹s fundamental tasks 
is to set up under the auspices of the Central Committee 
a school for training uyezd secretaries from among the 
most devoted and capable people, from among the peasants 
and workers. If the Party could by next year build 
around itself a reserve of 200 or 300 uyezd secretaries 
who could be sent to assist the Gubernia Committees in 
directing activities in the uyezds, i t would thereby 
ensure guidance of all the mass transmission apparatuses. 
There would not then be a single consumers¹ 
co-operative, a single rural co-operative, a single factory 
or works committee, a single women¹s delegate 
meeting, a single Youth League unit, a single mass 
apparatus in which the Party¹s influence would not 
predominate. 
Now about the regional organs. The past year has 
shown that the Party and the Central Committee were 
right in setting up regional organs, partly elected and 
partly appointed. When discussing the general question 
of delimiting administrative areas, the Central 
Committee arrived at the conclusion that in building 
up the regional Party organs, the Party must pass gradually 
from the principle of appointment to the principle 
of election, having in mind that such a change 
will undoubtedly create a favourable moral atmosphere 
around the Regional Party Committees and

J. V. S T A L I N 222 
make it easier for the Central Committee to lead the 
Party. 
I pass to the question of improving the Party¹s central 
organs. You have no doubt read the Central Committee¹s 
proposal that the functions of the Secretariat 
of the Central Committee should be quite clearly and 
precisely delimited from the functions of the Organising 
Bureau and of the Political Bureau. It is scarcely necessary 
to deal with this question separately, because 
it is perfectly clear. But there is one question‹the 
enlargement of the Central Committee itself‹which we 
have discussed several times inside the Central Committee, 
and which at one time gave rise to serious controversy. 
Some members of the Central Committee are 
of the opinion that the Central Committee should not 
be enlarged, but, on the contrary, reduced. I shall not 
give their reasons; let the comrades speak for themselves. 
I shall briefly give the reasons in favour of enlarging 
the Central Committee. 
The present state of affairs in the central apparatus 
of our Party is as follows: we have 27 members on the 
Central Committee. The Central Committee meets once 
every two months; but within the Central Committee 
there is a core of 10-15 persons who have become so 
skilled in the matter of directing the political and economic 
activities of our organs that they are in danger 
of becoming something in the nature of high priests in 
the art of leadership. This may be a good thing, but 
it has a very dangerous side: these comrades who have 
acquired great experience in leadership may become 
infected by self-conceit, may isolate themselves and become 
divorced from work among the masses. If some members

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 223 
of the Central Committee, or, say, the core of fifteen, 
have acquired such experience and have become so skilled 
that in drawing up instructions they make no mistakes 
in nine cases out of ten, that is a very good thing. But if 
they have not around themselves a new generation of 
future leaders who are closely connected with the work 
in the localities, all the chances are that these highlyskilled 
men will become ossified and divorced from the 
masses. 
Secondly, the core within the Central Committee that 
has gained great experience in the art of leadership is 
growing old; we must have people to take their place. 
You are aware of the state of Vladimir Ilyich¹s health. 
You know that the other members, too, of the main core 
of the Central Committee are pretty well worn out. The 
trouble is that we have not yet the new cadres to take 
their place. The training of Party leaders is a very difficult 
matter, it takes years, 5 to 10 years, more than 10. 
It is much easier to conquer a country with the aid of 
Comrade Budyonny¹s cavalry than to train two or three 
leaders from the rank and file capable of becoming real 
leaders of the country. And it is high time to think 
about training young leaders to take the place of the old. 
There is only one way of doing this, namely, to draw 
new, fresh forces into the work of the Central Committee 
and to promote them in the course of work, to promote 
the most capable and independent of them, those whose 
heads are screwed on in the right way. Leaders cannot 
be trained by means of books. Books help to make progress, 
but they do not create leaders. Leading workers 
mature only in the course of the work itself. Only by 
electing new members to the Central Committee, by

J. V. S T A L I N 224 
letting them experience the entire burden of leadership, 
shall we be able to train the replacements whom we need 
so much in the present state of things. That is why I think 
that the congress would make a profound mistake if it 
disagreed with the Central Committee¹s proposal that 
it be enlarged to at least forty members. 
In concluding my report I must mention a fact which 
is not conspicuous‹perhaps because it is too well known‹ 
but which should be mentioned because it is very important. 
I mean the unity of our Party, that unexampled 
solidarity which enabled our Party to avoid a split 
during such a turn as the introduction of the N.E.P. 
Not a single party in the world, not a single political 
party, could have made such an abrupt turn without 
confusion, without a split, without some group or other 
falling out of the cart. It is well known that when a turn 
like this is made, some group or other falls out of the 
cart, and confusion, if not a split, begins in the party. 
We had such a turn in the history of our Party in 1907 
and 1908, when, after 1905 and 1906, having been accustomed 
to revolutionary struggle, we did not want to go 
over to humdrum legal activity, we did not want to go into 
the Duma, to make use of legal institutions, to strengthen 
our positions in legal organisations and, in general, 
refused to adopt new methods. This turn was not as abrupt 
as the introduction of the N.E.P., but, evidently 
because we were then still a young party and had not 
yet gained experience in manoeuvring, the result was 
that two whole groups fell out of the cart at that time. 
Our present turn towards the N.E.P. after our policy 
of the offensive is an abrupt turn. And yet, during such 
a turn, when the proletariat was obliged temporarily to

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 225 
give up the offensive and retire to its former positions, 
was obliged to turn towards the peasantry in the rear in 
order not to lose contact with it, when the proletariat 
had to think about strengthening, reinforcing, its reserves 
in the East and in the West‹during such an abrupt 
turn the Party not only avoided a split, but made the 
turn without confusion. 
It testifies to the Party¹s unexampled flexibility, 
unity and solidarity. 
It is a guarantee that our Party will triumph. 
Last year our enemies croaked about disintegration 
in our Party, and they are croaking about it this year too. 
Nevertheless, while entering on the New Economic 
Policy we retained our positions, we have kept the 
threads of the national economy in our hands, and the 
Party continues to march forward, united to a man, 
whereas it is our enemies who are actually undergoing 
disintegration and liquidation. You have no doubt 
heard, comrades, that a congress of the Socialist- 
Revolutionaries took place in Moscow recently.65 That 
congress decided to appeal to our congress to open the 
door of our Party to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
You have no doubt also heard that Georgia, the former 
citadel of Menshevism, where the Menshevik Party has 
no less than 10,000 members, that stronghold of Menshevism 
is already collapsing and about 2,000 members 
have left the Menshevik ranks. That would seem to 
show that it is not our Party that is disintegrating, 
but that it is our enemies who are disintegrating. And 
lastly, you no doubt know that one of the most honest 
and practical of the Menshevik leaders‹Comrade 
Martynov‹has left the ranks of the Mensheviks, and

J. V. S T A L I N 226 
the Central Committee has accepted him as a member 
of our Party and moves that this congress endorse 
this acceptance. (Some applause.) All these facts show, 
comrades, not that things are bad in our Party, but 
that disintegration has set in among our enemies all 
along the line, while our Party has remained solid and 
united, it has stood the test of a momentous turn, and 
is marching forward with flying colours. (Loud and prolonged 
applause.)

2. REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION 
ON THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE¹S 
ORGANISATIONAL REPORT 
April 19 
Comrades, my reply to the discussion will consist of 
two parts. In the first part I shall deal with the Central 
Committee¹s organising work, since it was criticised by 
speakers. In the second part I shall deal with those of 
the Central Committee¹s organisational proposals which 
speakers did not criticise, and with which the congress 
evidently agrees. 
First I shall say a few words about the critics of the 
Central Committee¹s report. 
About Lutovinov. He is displeased with the regime 
in our Party: there is no free speech in our Party, there 
is no legality, no democracy. He knows, of course, that 
never in the past six years has the Central Committee prepared 
for a congress so democratically as it prepared for 
this one. He knows that immediately after the February 
Plenum, the members of the Central Committee and the 
candidate members of the Central Committee dispersed 
to all parts of our federation and delivered reports on the 
work of the Central Committee. He, Lutovinov, must 
know that four issues of the Discussion Sheet66 have 
already appeared, and in them the Central Committee¹s

J. V. S T A L I N 228 
activities are analysed and interpreted quite at random, 
I repeat, at random. But that is not enough for 
Lutovinov. He wants ³real² democracy; he wants to 
have at least all the major questions discussed in all 
the units, from the bottom up; he wants the whole 
Party to be stirred up on every question and to take 
part in the discussion of it. But, comrades, now that we 
are in power, now that we have no fewer than 400,000 
members and no fewer than 20,000 Party units, I do not 
know what that sort of thing would lead to. The Party 
would be transformed into a debating society that would 
be eternally talking and would decide nothing. But above 
all our Party must be a party of action, for we are in 
power. 
Furthermore, Lutovinov forgets that although we are 
in power within the federation and enjoy all the advantages 
of legality, from the international standpoint, however, 
we are going through a period similar to that which 
we went through in 1912, when the Party was semi-legal, 
or rather, illegal, when the Party had a few legal footholds 
in the shape of the group in the Duma, in the shape of 
legal newspapers and clubs, but at the same time was 
surrounded by enemies, and was striving to accumulate 
forces in order to push forward, and to enlarge the legal 
framework. We are now going through a similar period on 
an international scale. We are surrounded by enemies‹ 
that is evident to everybody. The imperialist wolves 
who surround us are wide awake. Not a moment passes 
without our enemies trying to capture some gap through 
which to crawl and do us damage. There are no grounds 
for asserting that the enemies who surround us are not 
conducting some kind of preparatory work for a blockade,

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 229 
or for intervention. Such is the situation. Is it possible 
in such a situation to discuss all questions of war and 
peace in public? To discuss a question at meetings of 
20,000 Party units is tantamount to discussing it in public. 
What would have become of us had we discussed 
in public all our preliminary work for the Genoa Conference? 
We would have gone down with a crash. It must 
be borne in mind that in a situation, when we are surrounded 
by enemies, a sudden stroke, an unexpected 
manoeuvre on our part, swift action, decides everything. 
What would have become of us if instead of discussing our 
political campaign at the Lausanne Conference in a narrow 
circle of trusted Party people, we had discussed all 
this work publicly, had exposed our hand? Our enemies 
would have taken all the weak and strong points into 
account, they would have defeated our campaign, and 
we would have left Lausanne in disgrace. What would 
become of us if we were to discuss publicly in advance 
the questions of war and peace, the most important of 
all important questions? For, I repeat, to discuss questions 
at meetings of 20,000 units is tantamount to discussing 
them in public. We would be smashed in no time. 
It is obvious, comrades, that for both organisational 
and political reasons Lutovinov¹s so-called democracy 
is a fantasy, is democratic Manilovism. It is false and 
dangerous. Lutovinov¹s road is not ours. 
I pass on to Osinsky. He pounced upon the phrase 
in my statement that in enlarging the Central Committee 
we must get independent people on it. Yes, yes, 
Sorin, independent, but not freelances. Osinsky thinks 
that on this point I established some sort of a link with 
Osinsky, with democratic centralism.67 I did say that

J. V. S T A L I N 230 
the Central Committee should be reinforced with comrades 
who are independent. I did not say independent 
of what, knowing in advance that it is unwise to deal 
exhaustively with all points in the main speech, that 
something should be left for the speech in reply to the 
discussion. (Laughter. Applause.) We need independent 
people in the Central Committee, but not people independent 
of Leninism‹no comrades, God forbid! We need 
independent people, people free from personal influences, 
free from the habits and traditions of the internal 
struggle in the Central Committee that we have acquired, 
and which sometimes cause anxiety in the Central 
Committee. You remember Comrade Lenin¹s article. He 
says in it that we are faced with the prospect of a split. 
Since that passage in Comrade Lenin¹s article might 
have caused the organisations to think that a split is 
already maturing in the Party, the members of the Central 
Committee unanimously decided to dispel doubts 
that might arise and said that there is no split in the 
Central Committee, which is quite in accordance with the 
facts. But the Central Committee also said that the prospect 
of a split is not excluded. That, too, is quite correct. 
In the course of its work during the past six years 
the Central Committee has acquired (and was bound 
to acquire) certain habits and traditions of struggle within 
it which sometimes create an atmosphere that is not 
quite good. I felt this atmosphere at one of the last 
plenary meetings of the Central Committee in February, 
and I remarked at the time that the intervention of 
people from the districts often decides the whole matter. 
We need people who are independent of those traditions 
and of those personal influences in order that, on becom

ing members of the Central Committee and bringing 
into it the experience of practical work and contact with 
the districts, they should serve as the mortar, so to 
speak, to cement the Central Committee as a single and 
indivisible collective body leading our Party. We need 
such independent comrades, free from the old traditions 
that have become established in the Central Committee, 
precisely as people who will introduce a new, refreshing 
element that will cement the Central Committee, and 
avert any possibility of a split within it. That is what 
I meant when I spoke about independent people. 
Comrades, I cannot ignore the thrust that Osinsky 
made at Zinoviev. He praised Comrade Stalin, he praised 
Kamenev, but he kicked Zinoviev, calculating that 
it will be enough to get rid of one for the time being, 
and that the turn of the others will come later. He has 
set out to break up the core that has been formed within 
the Central Committee in the course of years of work 
in order gradually, step by step, to break up the whole. 
If Osinsky seriously thinks of pursuing that aim, if he 
seriously thinks of launching such attacks against individual 
members of the core of our Central Committee, 
I must warn him that he will collide with a wall against 
which, I am afraid, he will break his head. 
Lastly, about Mdivani. May I be permitted to say 
a few words about this question, which has bored the 
whole congress. He talked about the Central Committee¹s 
vacillations. He said that one day it decides to unite 
the economic efforts of the three Transcaucasian republics, 
the next day it decides that these republics 
should unite in a federation, and the day after that it 
takes a third decision that all the Soviet republics should

J. V. S T A L I N 232 
unite in a Union of Republics. That is what he calls 
the Central Committee¹s vacillations. Is that right? No, 
comrades, that is not vacillation, it is system. The independent 
republics first drew together on an economic 
basis. That step was taken as far back as 1921. After 
it was found that the experiment of drawing together 
the republics was producing good results the next step 
was taken‹federation, particularly in a place like Transcaucasia, 
where it is impossible to dispense with a special 
organ of national peace. As you know, Transcaucasia 
is a country where there were Tatar-Armenian massacres 
while still under the tsar, and war under the 
Mussavatists, Dashnaks and Mensheviks. To put a stop 
to that strife an organ of national peace was needed, i.e., 
a supreme authority whose word would carry weight. 
It was absolutely impossible to create such an organ 
of national peace without the participation of representatives 
of the Georgian nation. And so, several months 
after the economic efforts were united, the next step 
was taken‹a federation of republics, and a year after 
that yet another step was taken, marking the final stages 
in the process of uniting the republics‹a Union of 
Republics was formed. Where is there vacillation in 
that? I t is the system of our national policy. Mdivani 
has simply failed to grasp the essence of our 
Soviet policy, although he regards himself as an old 
Bolshevik. 
He asked a number of questions, insinuating that 
the major questions concerning the national aspect of 
affairs in Transcaucasia, and particularly in Georgia, 
were decided either by the Central Committee or by individuals. 
The fundamental question in Transcaucasia

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 233 
is the question of the federation of Transcaucasia. Permit 
me to read a small document that gives the history of 
the directive of the Central Committee of the R.C.P. 
on the Transcaucasian Federation. 
On November 28, 1921, Comrade Lenin sent me a 
draft of his proposal for the formation of a federation of 
the Transcaucasian republics. It states: 
³1) to recognise the federation of the Transcaucasian 
republics as absolutely correct in principle and 
its realisation as absolutely necessary, although i t 
would be premature to apply it in practice immediately, 
i.e., it would require several weeks for discussion and 
propaganda, and for carrying it through from below; 
³2) to instruct the Central Committees of Georgia, 
Armenia and Azerbaijan to carry out this decision.² 
I wrote to Comrade Lenin and suggested that there 
should be no hurry about this, that we ought to wait a 
little to give the local people a certain period of time 
to carry through the federation. I wrote to him: 
³Comrade Lenin, I am not opposed to your resolution, 
if you agree to accept the following amendment: 
instead of the words Œwould require several weeks for 
discussion,¹ in Point 1, say: Œwould require a certain period 
of time for discussion,¹ and so on, in accordance 
with your resolution. The point is that in Georgia it is 
impossible to Œcarry through¹ federation Œfrom below¹ 
by ŒSoviet procedure¹ in Œseveral weeks,¹ since the 
Soviets in Georgia are only just beginning to be organised. 
They are not yet completely built. A month ago 
they did not exist at all, and to call a Congress of Soviets 
there in Œseveral weeks¹ is inconceivable; and, well, a 
Transcaucasian federation without Georgia would be

J. V. S T A L I N 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR

DISTRIBUTION 
234 
a federation on paper only. I think we must allow two 
or three months for the idea of federation to triumph 
among the broad masses of Georgia. Stalin.² 
Comrade Lenin answered: ³I accept this amendment.² 
Next day that proposal was adopted by the votes of 
Lenin, Trotsky, Kamenev, Molotov and Stalin. Zinoviev 
was absent, his place was taken by Molotov. The decision 
was adopted by the Political Bureau at the end 
of 1921, as you see, unanimously. The struggle which 
the group of Georgian Communists headed by Mdivani 
is waging against the Central Committee¹s directive 
concerning federation dates back to that time. You see, 
comrades, that the case is not as Mdivani presented it. 
I quote this document against those unseemly insinuations 
which Mdivani made here. 
The second question: how is the fact to be explained 
that the group of comrades headed by Mdivani has been 
recalled by the Central Committee of the Party, what is 
the reason of that? There are two chief and, at the same 
time, formal reasons. I must say this because reproaches 
have been levelled at the Central Committee, and at me 
in particular. 
The f i r s t reason i s that the Mdivani group has 
no influence in its own Georgian Communist Party, that 
it is repudiated by the Georgian Communist Party itself. 
This Party has held two congresses: the first congress 
was held at the beginning of 1922, and the second was 
held at the beginning of 1923. At both congresses the 
Mdivani group, and its idea of rejecting federation, was 
emphatically opposed by its own Party. At the first 
congress, I think, out of a total of 122 votes he obtained 
somewhere about 18; and at the second congress, out

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 235 
of a total of 144 votes he obtained about 20. Mdivani was 
persistently refused election to the Central Committee; 
his position was systematically rejected. On the first 
occasion, at the beginning of 1922, we in the Central 
Committee brought pressure to bear upon the Communist 
Party of Georgia and compelled it against its will 
to accept these old comrades (Mdivani is certainly an 
old comrade, and so is Makharadze), thinking that the 
two groups, the majority and the minority, would eventually 
work together. In the interval between the first 
and second congresses, however, there were a number 
of conferences, city and all-Georgian, at which the Mdivani 
group was everywhere severely trounced by its 
own Party, until finally, at the last congress, Mdivani 
barely scraped together 18 votes out of 140. 
The Transcaucasian Federation is an organisation 
that affects not only Georgia, but the whole of Transcaucasia. 
As a rule, the Georgian Party congress is followed 
by a Transcaucasian congress. There we have the same 
picture. At the last Transcaucasian congress, out of a 
total of, I think, 244 votes, Mdivani barely obtained 
about 10 votes. Such are the facts. What is the Central 
Committee of the Party to do in such a situation, where 
the Party, the Georgian organisation itself, cannot stand 
the Mdivani group? I understand our policy in the 
national question to be a policy of concessions to non- 
Russians and to national prejudices. That policy is undoubtedly 
correct. But is it permissible to go on without 
end thwarting the will of the Party in which the 
Mdivani group has to work? In my opinion it is not. On 
the contrary, we must as far as possible harmonise our 
actions with the will of the Party in Georgia. That is

J. V. S T A L I N 236 
what the Central Committee did when it recalled certain 
members of this group. 
The second reason that prompted the Central Committee 
to recall certain comrades of this group is that 
they repeatedly disobeyed the decisions of the Central 
Committee of the R.C.P. I have already told you the 
history of the decision concerning federation; I have 
already said that without this organ national peace is 
impossible; that in Transcaucasia only the Soviet Government 
succeeded in establishing national peace by creating 
the federation. That is why we in the Central Committee 
regarded that decision as being absolutely binding. 
But what do we see? That the Mdivani group disobeys 
that decision. More than that, it opposes it. That 
has been established both by Comrade Dzerzhinsky¹s 
commission and by the Kamenev-Kuibyshev commission. 
Even now, after the decision of the March Plenum 
concerning Georgia, Mdivani is continuing to oppose 
federation. What is that if not contempt for the Central 
Committee¹s decisions? 
Such are the circumstances that compelled the Central 
Committee of the Party to recall Mdivani. 
Mdivani tries to make it appear that, in spite of 
his recall, he is the victor. If that is victory, I don¹t 
know what defeat is. You know, of course, that Don 
Quixote, of blessed memory, also regarded himself as the 
victor when he was knocked head over heels by windmill 
sails. I have a notion that certain comrades who are 
working in a certain piece of Soviet territory called 
Georgia are not all there in their upper storeys. 
I pass on to Comrade Makharadze. He declared here 
that he is an old Bolshevik in the national question,

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 237 
that he belongs to the school of Lenin. That is not true, 
comrades. At the conference held in April 1917,68 Comrade 
Lenin and I fought against Comrade Makharadze. 
He was then against the self-determination of nations, 
against the basis of our programme, against the right of 
nations to exist as independent states. He upheld that 
standpoint and fought the Party. Later he changed his 
opinion (that, of course, is to his credit), but still, he 
should not have forgotten this! He is not an old Bolshevik 
in the national question, but rather a fairly 
young one. 
Comrade Makharadze put to me a parliamentary interpellation: 
do I admit, or does the Central Committee 
admit, that the organisation of the Georgian Communists 
is a real organisation which is to be trusted, and if so, 
does the Central Committee agree to this organisation 
having the right to raise questions and put forward its 
proposals? If all that is admitted, does the Central Committee 
consider that the regime that has been established 
there, in Georgia, is intolerable? 
I shall answer this parliamentary interpellation. 
Of course, the Central Committee trusts the Communist 
Party of Georgia‹whom else should it trust?! The 
Communist Party of Georgia represents the essence, the 
best elements, of the Georgian people, without whom it 
would be impossible to govern Georgia. But every organisation 
consists of a majority and a minority. We have 
not a single organisation in which there is not a majority 
and a minority. And in practice we see that the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia 
consists of a majority which is carrying out the Party 
line, and of a minority which does not always carry out

J. V. S T A L I N 238 
this line. Obviously, we are referring to trust in the 
organisation as represented by its majority. 
The second question: Have the national Central Committees 
the right to initiative, to raise questions; have 
they the right to make proposals? 
Of course they have. That is obvious. What I do not 
understand is, why did Comrade Makharadze not present 
us with any facts to prove that the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of Georgia is not allowed 
to raise questions, is not allowed to make proposals and 
to discuss them? I am not aware of any such facts. I 
think that Comrade Makharadze would submit such 
materials to the Central Committee if he had any at all. 
The third question: can the regime that has been 
created in Georgia be tolerated? 
Unfortunately, the question lacks concreteness. What 
regime? If he means the regime under which the Soviet 
power in Georgia has recently been ejecting the nobles 
from their nests, and also Mensheviks and counter-revolutionaries, 
if he means that regime, then, in my opinion, 
there is nothing bad about it. It is our Soviet regime. 
If, however, he means that the Transcaucasian Territorial 
Committee has created conditions making it impossible 
for the Communist Party of Georgia to develop, I 
have no facts to show that this is so. The Georgian Central 
Committee that was elected at the last congress of 
the Georgian Communist Party by 110 votes against 18, 
did not raise this question with us. It is working in complete 
harmony with the Transcaucasian Territorial Committee 
of our Party. If there is a small group, a trend, 
in short, members of the Party, who are dissatisfied with 
the Party regime, they ought to submit the relevant ma

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 239 
terial to the Central Committee. Two commissions have 
already been to Georgia to investigate such complaints, 
one that of Dzerzhinsky, and the other that of Kamenev 
and Kuibyshev. We can set up a third commission if 
need be. 
With this I conclude the first part of my reply to 
the discussion on the Central Committee¹s organisational 
activities during the past year. 
I pass on to the second part, to the proposals on 
organisation which the Central Committee has submitted 
for the consideration of the congress. As far as I 
know, none of the speakers has criticised any of the proposals 
submitted by the Central Committee. I interpret 
this as an expression of complete agreement with the 
proposals the Central Committee has submitted for your 
consideration. Nevertheless, I would like to help, and 
to move a number of amendments. I shall submit these 
amendments to the committee which the Central Committee 
thinks should be set up, to the Organisational 
Committee, in which Comrade Molotov will be in charge 
of the main work as regards Party affairs, and Comrade 
Dzerzhinsky as regards Soviet affairs. 
The first amendment is that the number of candidate 
members of the Central Committee be increased 
from five to at least fifteen. 
The second amendment is that special attention be 
devoted to strengthening and enlarging the Registration 
and Distribution departments both at the top and bottom 
levels, because these bodies are now acquiring enormous, 
first-rate importance, because they are the most effective 
means by which the Party can keep hold of all the 
threads of our economy and of the Soviet apparatus.

J. V. S T A L I N 240 
The third amendment is that the congress should 
approve the proposal to set up under the auspices of the 
Central Committee a school for training uyezd secretaries, 
so that by the end of the year the Gubernia Committees 
may have 200 to 300 uyezd secretaries at their disposal. 
And the fourth amendment concerns the press. I 
have nothing concrete to propose on this point, but I 
would like the congress to pay particular attention to 
the task of raising the press to the proper level. It is 
making progress, it has made big progress, but not 
as much as is needed. The press must grow day in and 
day out‹it is our Party¹s sharpest and most powerful 
weapon. 
In conclusion, a few words about the present congress. 
Comrades, I must say that I have not for a long 
time seen a congress so united and inspired by a single 
idea as this one is. I regret that Comrade Lenin is not 
here. If he were here he would be able to say: ³I tended 
the Party for twenty-five years and made it great and 
strong.² (Prolonged applause.)

3. REPORT ON NATIONAL 
FACTORS IN PARTY AND STATE 
AFFAIRS 
April 23 
Comrades, this is the third time since the October 
Revolution that we are discussing the national question: 
the first time was at the Eighth Congress, the second 
was at the Tenth, and the third at the Twelfth. Does 
this indicate that some fundamental change has taken 
place in our views on the national question? No, our 
fundamental outlook on the national question has remained 
what it was before and after the October Revolution. 
But since the Tenth Congress the international situation 
has changed in that the heavy reserves of the revolution 
which the countries of the East now constitute 
have acquired greater importance. That is the first point. 
The second point is that since the Tenth Congress our 
Party has also witnessed certain changes in the internal 
situation in connection with the New Economic Policy. 
All these new factors must be taken into account and 
the conclusions must be drawn from them. It is in this 
sense that it can be said that the national question is 
being presented at the Twelfth Congress in a new way. 
The international significance of the national question. 
You know, comrades, that by the will of history 
we, the Soviet federation, now represent the advanced 
detachment of the world revolution. You know that we

J. V. S T A L I N 242 
were the first to breach the general capitalist front, that 
it has been our destiny to be ahead of all others. You 
know that in our advance we got as far as Warsaw, that 
we then retreated and entrenched ourselves in the positions 
we considered strongest. From that moment we 
passed to the New Economic Policy, from that moment 
we took into account the slowing down of the international 
revolutionary movement, and from that moment 
our policy changed from the offensive to the defensive. 
We could not advance after we had suffered a reverse 
at Warsaw (let us not hide the truth); we could not advance, 
for we would have run the risk of being cut off 
from the rear, which in our case is a peasant rear; and, 
lastly, we would have run the risk of advancing too far 
ahead of the reserves of the revolution with which destiny 
has provided us, the reserves in the West and the East. 
That is why we made a turn towards the New Economic 
Policy within the country, and towards a slower advance 
outside; for we decided that it was necessary to have 
a respite, to heal our wounds, the wounds of the advanced 
detachment, the proletariat, to establish contact with 
the peasant rear and to conduct further work among the 
reserves, which were lagging behind us‹the reserves in 
the West and the heavy reserves in the East which are 
the main rear of world capitalism. It is these reserves‹ 
heavy reserves, which at the same time are the rear of 
world imperialism‹that we have in mind when discussing 
the national question. 
One thing or the other: either we succeed in stirring 
up, in revolutionising, the remote rear of imperialism‹ 
the colonial and semi-colonial countries of the East‹ 
and thereby hasten the fall of imperialism; or we fail

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 243 
to do so, and thereby strengthen imperialism and weaken 
the force of our movement. That is how the question 
stands. 
The fact of the matter is that the whole East regards 
our Union of Republics as an experimental field. Either 
we find a correct practical solution of the national question 
within the framework of this Union, either we here, 
within the framework of this Union, establish truly fraternal 
relations and true co-operation among the peoples 
‹in which case the whole East will see that our federation 
is the banner of its liberation, is its advanced detachment, 
in whose footsteps it must follow‹and that will 
be the beginning of the collapse of world imperialism. 
Or we commit a blunder here, undermine the confidence 
of the formerly oppressed peoples in the proletariat of 
Russia, and deprive the Union of Republics of the power 
of attraction which it possesses in the eyes of the East‹ 
in which case imperialism will win and we shall lose. 
Therein lies the international significance of the national 
question. 
The national question is also of importance for us 
from the standpoint of the internal situation, not only 
because the former dominant nation numbers about 
75,000,000 and the other nations 65,000,000 (not a small 
figure, anyway), and not only because the formerly oppressed 
nationalities inhabit areas that are the most 
essential for our economic development and the most 
important from the standpoint of military strategy, but 
above all because during the past two years we have introduced 
what is known as the N.E.P., as a result of 
which Great-Russian nationalism has begun to grow and 
become more pronounced, the Smena-Vekhist idea has

J. V. S T A L I N 244 
come into being, and one can discern the desire to accomplish 
by peaceful means what Denikin failed to accomplish, 
i.e., to create the so-called ³one and indivisible.² 
Thus, as a result of the N.E.P., a new force is arising 
in the internal life of our country, namely, Great- 
Russian chauvinism, which entrenches itself in our institutions, 
which penetrates not only the Soviet institutions, 
but also the Party institutions, and which is to 
be found in all parts of our federation. Consequently, 
if we do not resolutely combat this new force, if we do 
not cut it off at the root‹and the N.E.P. conditions foster 
it‹we run the risk of being confronted by a rupture 
between the proletariat of the former dominant nation 
and the peasants of the formerly oppressed nations‹ 
which will mean undermining the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. 
But the N.E.P. fosters not only Great-Russian chauvinism‹
it also fosters local chauvinism, especially in 
those republics where there are several nationalities. I 
have in mind Georgia, Azerbaijan, Bukhara and partly 
Turkestan; in each of these there are several nationalities, 
the advanced elements of which may soon begin to compete 
among themselves for supremacy. Of course, this 
local chauvinism as regards its strength is not such a 
danger as Great-Russian chauvinism. But it is a danger 
nevertheless, for it threatens to convert some of the republics 
into arenas of national squabbling and to weaken 
the bonds of internationalism there. 
Such are the international and internal circumstances 
that make the national question one of great, of firstrate, 
importance in general, and at the present moment 
in particular.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 245 
What is the class essence of the national question? 
Under the present conditions of Soviet development, the 
class essence of the national question lies in the establishment 
of correct mutual relations between the proletariat 
of the former dominant nation and the peasantry 
of the formerly oppressed nationalities. The question of 
the bond has been more than sufficiently discussed here, 
but when this question was discussed in connection with 
the report of Kamenev, Kalinin, Sokolnikov, Rykov and 
Trotsky, what was mainly in mind was the relations 
between the Russian proletariat and the Russian peasantry. 
Here, in the national sphere, we have a more complex 
mechanism. Here we are concerned with establishing correct 
mutual relations between the proletariat of the former 
dominant nation, which is the most cultured section 
of the proletariat in our entire federation, and the peasantry, 
mainly of the formerly oppressed nationalities. 
This is the class essence of the national question. If the 
proletariat succeeds in establishing with the peasantry 
of the other nationalities relations that can eradicate all 
remnants of mistrust towards everything Russian, a mistrust 
implanted and fostered for decades by the policy 
of tsarism‹if, moreover, the Russian proletariat succeeds 
in establishing complete mutual understanding and 
confidence, in effecting a genuine alliance not only between 
the proletariat and the Russian peasantry, but also 
between the proletariat and peasantry of the formerly 
oppressed nationalities, the problem will be solved. To 
achieve this, proletarian power must become as dear to 
the peasantry of the other nationalities as it is to the 
Russian peasantry. And in order that Soviet power may 
become dear also to the peasants of these nationalities, it

J. V. S T A L I N 246 
must be understood by these peasants, it must function 
in their native languages, the schools and governmental 
bodies must be staffed with local people who know the 
language, habits, customs and manner of life of the non- 
Russian nationalities. Soviet power, which until very recently 
was Russian power, will become a power which is 
not merely Russian but inter-national, a power dear 
to the peasants of the formerly oppressed nationalities, 
only when and to the degree that the institutions and 
governmental bodies in the republics of these countries 
begin to speak and function in the native languages. 
That is one of the fundamentals of the national question 
in general, and under Soviet conditions in particular. 
What is the characteristic feature of the solution of 
the national question at the present moment, in 1923? 
What form have the problems requiring solution in the 
national sphere assumed in 1923? The form of establishing 
co-operation between the peoples of our federation 
in the economic, military and political spheres. I have 
in mind inter-national relations. The national question, 
at the basis of which lie the tasks of establishing correct 
relations between the proletariat of the former dominant 
nation and the peasantry of the other nationalities, assumes 
at the present time the special form of establishing 
the co-operation and fraternal co-existence of those nations 
which were formerly disunited and which are now 
uniting in a single state. 
Such is the essence of the national question in the 
form it has assumed in 1923. 
The concrete form of this state union is the Union 
of Republics, which we already discussed at the Congress

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 247 
of Soviets at the end of last year, and which we then 
established. 
The basis of this Union is the voluntary consent 
and the juridical equality of the members of the Union. 
Voluntary consent and equality‹because our national 
programme starts out from the clause on the right of nations 
to exist as independent states, what was formerly 
called the right to self-determination. Proceeding from 
this, we must definitely say that no union of peoples into 
a single state can be durable unless it is based on absolutely 
voluntary consent, unless the peoples themselves 
wish to unite. The second basis is the juridical equality 
of the peoples which form the Union. That is natural. 
I am not speaking of actual equality‹I shall come to 
that later‹for the establishment of actual equality between 
nations which have forged ahead and backward 
nations is a very complicated, very difficult, matter that 
must take a number of years. I am speaking now about 
juridical equality. This equality finds expression in the 
fact that all the republics, in this case the four republics: 
Transcaucasia, Byelorussia, the Ukraine and the 
R.S.F.S.R., forming the Union, enjoy the benefits of the 
Union to an equal degree and at the same time to an 
equal degree forgo certain of their independent rights 
in favour of the Union. If the R.S.F.S.R., the Ukraine, 
Byelorussia and the Transcaucasian Republic are not 
each to have its own People¹s Commissariat of Foreign 
Affairs, it is obvious that the abolition of these Commissariats 
and the establishment of a common Commissariat 
of Foreign Affairs for the Union of Republics will entail 
a certain restriction of the independence which these 
republics formerly enjoyed, and this restriction will be

J. V. S T A L I N 248 
equal for all the republics forming the Union. Obviously, 
if these republics formerly had their own People¹s Commissariats 
of Foreign Trade, and these Commissariats 
are now abolished both in the R.S.F.S.R. and in the 
other republics in order to make way for a common Commissariat 
of Foreign Trade for the Union of Republics, 
this too will involve a certain restriction of the independence 
formerly enjoyed in full measure, but now curtailed 
in favour of the common Union, and so on, and so 
forth. Some people ask a purely scholastic question, 
namely: do the republics remain independent after uniting? 
That is a scholastic question. Their independence 
is restricted, for every union involves a certain restriction 
of the former rights of the parties to the union. But the 
basic elements of independence of each of these republics 
certainly remain, if only because every republic retains 
the right to secede from the Union at its own discretion. 
Thus, the concrete form the national question has 
assumed under the conditions at present prevailing in 
our country is how to achieve the co-operation of the 
peoples in economic, foreign and military affairs. We 
must unite the republics along these lines into a single 
union called the U.S.S.R. Such are the concrete forms 
the national question has assumed at the present time. 
But that is easier said than done. The fact of the 
matter is that under the conditions prevailing in our 
country, there are, in addition to the factors conducive 
to the union of the peoples into one state, a number of 
factors which hinder this union. 
You know what the conducive factors are: first of 
all, the economic coming together of the peoples that

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 249 
was established prior to Soviet power and which was 
consolidated by Soviet power; a certain division of labour 
between the peoples, established before our time, 
but consolidated by us, by the Soviet power. That is 
the basic factor conducive to the union of the republics 
into a Union. The nature of Soviet power must be regarded 
as the second factor conducive to union. That is 
natural. Soviet power is the power of the workers, the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, which by its very nature 
disposes the labouring elements of the republics and 
peoples which form the Union to live in friendly relations 
with one another. That is natural. And the third factor 
conducive to union is the imperialist encirclement, forming 
an environment in which the Union of Republics 
is obliged to operate. 
But there are also factors which hinder, which impede, 
this union. The principal force impeding the union 
of the republics into a single union is that force which, 
as I have said, is growing in our country under the conditions 
of the N.E.P.: Great-Russian chauvinism. It is 
by no means accidental, comrades, that the Smena-Vekhites 
have recruited a large number of supporters among 
Soviet officials. That is by no means accidental. Nor is it 
accidental that Messieurs the Smena-Vekhites are singing 
the praises of the Bolshevik Communists, as much 
as to say: You may talk about Bolshevism as much as 
you like, you may prate as much as you like about your 
internationalist tendencies, but we know that you will 
achieve what Denikin failed to achieve, that you Bolsheviks 
have resurrected, or at all events will resurrect, 
the idea of a Great Russia. All that is not accidental. 
Nor is it accidental that this idea has even penetrated

J. V. S T A L I N 250 
some of our Party institutions. At the February Plenum, 
where the question of a second chamber was first raised, 
I witnessed how certain members of the Central Committee 
made speeches which were inconsistent with communism‹
speeches which had nothing in common with 
internationalism. All this is a sign of the times, an epidemic. 
The chief danger that arises from this is that, 
owing to the N.E.P. , dominant-nation chauvinism is 
growing in our country by leaps and bounds, striving 
to obliterate all that is not Russian, to gather all the 
threads of government into the hands of Russians and 
to stifle everything that is not Russian. The chief danger 
is that with such a policy we run the risk that the Russian 
proletarians will lose the confidence of the formerly 
oppressed nations which they won in the October days, 
when they overthrew the landlords and the Russian capitalists, 
when they smashed the chains of national oppression 
within Russia, withdrew the troops from Persia 
and Mongolia, proclaimed the independence of Finland 
and Armenia and, in general, put the national question 
on an entirely new basis. Unless we all arm ourselves 
against this new, I repeat, Great-Russian chauvinism, 
which is advancing, creeping, insinuating itself drop 
by drop into the eyes and ears of our officials and step 
by step corrupting them, we may lose down to the last 
shreds the confidence we earned at that time. It is this 
danger, comrades, that we must defeat at all costs. Otherwise 
we are threatened with the prospect of losing the 
confidence of the workers and peasants of the formerly 
oppressed peoples, we are threatened with the prospect 
of a rupture of the ties between these peoples and the 
Russian proletariat, and this threatens us with the dan

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 251 
ger of a crack being formed in the system of our dictatorship. 
Do not forget, comrades, that if we were able to march 
against Kerensky with flying colours and overthrow the 
Provisional Government it was because, among other 
things, we were backed by the confidence of the oppressed 
peoples that were expecting liberation at the hands 
of the Russian proletarians. Do not forget such reserves 
as the oppressed peoples, who are silent, but who by 
their silence exert pressure and decide a great deal. This 
is often not felt, but these peoples are living, they exist, 
and they must not be forgotten. Do not forget that if 
we had not had in the rear of Kolchak, Denikin, Wrangel 
and Yudenich the so-called ³aliens,² if we had not 
had the formerly oppressed peoples, who disorganised the 
rear of those generals by their tacit sympathy for the 
Russian-proletarians‹comrades, this is a special factor 
in our development, this tacit sympathy, which nobody 
hears or sees, but which decides everything‹if it had not 
been for this sympathy, we would not have knocked 
out a single one of these generals. While we were marching 
against them, disintegration began in their rear. 
Why? Because those generals depended on the Cossack 
colonising elements, they held out to the oppressed peoples 
the prospect of further oppression, and the oppressed 
peoples were therefore pushed into our arms, while 
we unfurled the banner of the liberation of these oppressed 
peoples. That is what decided the fate of those generals; 
such is the sum-total of the factors which, although 
overshadowed by our armies¹ victories, in the long run 
decided everything. That must not be forgotten. That is 
why we must make a sharp turn towards combating

J. V. S T A L I N 252 
the new chauvinist sentiments and pillory those bureaucrats 
in our institutions and those Party comrades who 
are forgetting what we gained in October, namely, the 
confidence of the formerly oppressed peoples, a confidence 
that we must cherish. 
It must be understood that if a force like Great-Russian 
chauvinism blossoms and spreads, there will be no 
confidence on the part of the formerly oppressed peoples, 
we shall have no co-operation within a single union, and 
we shall have no Union of Republics. 
Such is the first and most dangerous factor that is 
impeding the union of the peoples and republics into a 
single union. 
The second factor, comrades, which is also hindering 
the union of the formerly oppressed peoples around the 
Russian proletariat, is the actual inequality of nations 
that we have inherited from the period of tsarism. 
We have proclaimed juridical equality and are practising 
it; but juridical equality, although in itself of 
very great importance in the history of the development 
of the Soviet republics, is still far from being actual 
equality. Formally, all the backward nationalities and 
all the peoples enjoy just as many rights as are enjoyed 
by the other, more advanced, nations which constitute 
our federation. But the trouble is that some nationalities 
have no proletarians of their own, have not undergone 
industrial development, have not even started on 
this road, are terribly backward culturally and are entirely 
unable to take advantage of the rights granted 
them by the revolution. This, comrades, is a far more 
important question than that of the schools. Some of 
our comrades here think that the knot can be cut by put

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 253 
ting the question of schools and language in the forefront. 
That is not so, comrades. Schools will not carry 
you very far. These schools are developing, so are the 
languages, but actual inequality remains the basis of all 
the discontent and friction. Schools and language will 
not settle the matter; what is needed is real, systematic, 
sincere and genuine proletarian assistance on our part 
to the labouring masses of the culturally and economically 
backward nationalities. In addition to schools and language, 
the Russian proletariat must take all measures to 
create in the border regions, in the culturally backward 
republics‹and they are not backward because of any 
fault of their own, but because they were formerly regarded 
as sources of raw materials‹must take all measures 
to ensure the building of centres of industry in 
these republics. Certain attempts have been made in this 
direction. Georgia has taken a factory from Moscow and 
it should start operating soon. Bukhara has taken one 
factory, but could have taken four. Turkestan is taking 
one large factory. Thus, all the facts show that these 
economically backward republics, which possess no proletariat, 
must with the aid of the Russian proletariat establish 
their own centres of industry, even though small 
ones, in order to create in these centres groups of local 
proletarians to serve as a bridge between the Russian 
proletarians and peasants and the labouring masses of 
these republics. In this sphere we have a lot of work to 
do, and schools alone will not settle the matter. 
But there is still a third factor that is impeding the 
union of the republics into a single union: the existence 
of nationalism in the individual republics. The N.E.P. 
affects not only the Russian, but also the non-Russian

J. V. S T A L I N 254 
population. The New Economic Policy is developing 
private trade and industry not only in the centre of 
Russia, but also in the individual republics. And it is 
this same N.E.P. , and the private capital associated 
with it, which nourish and foster Georgian, Azerbaijanian, 
Uzbek and other nationalism. Of course, if there 
were no Great-Russian chauvinism‹which is aggressive 
because it is strong, because it was also strong previously 
and has retained the habit of oppressing and humiliating‹
if there were no Great-Russian chauvinism, then, 
perhaps, local chauvinism also, as a retaliation to Great- 
Russian chauvinism, would exist only in a much reduced 
form, in miniature, so to speak; because, in the final 
analysis, anti-Russian nationalism is a form of defence, 
an ugly form of defence against Great-Russian nationalism, 
against Great-Russian chauvinism. If this nationalism 
were only defensive, it might not be worth making 
a fuss about. We could concentrate the entire force of 
our activities, the entire force of our struggle, against 
Great-Russian chauvinism, in the hope that as soon as 
this powerful enemy is overcome, anti-Russian nationalism 
will be overcome with it; for, I repeat, in the last 
analysis, this nationalism is a reaction to Great-Russian 
nationalism, a retaliation to it, a certain form of defence. 
Yes, that would be so if anti-Russian nationalism 
in the localities were nothing more than a reaction to 
Great-Russian nationalism. But the trouble is that in 
some republics this defensive nationalism is turning into 
aggressive nationalism. 
Take Georgia. Over 30 per cent of her population 
are non-Georgians. They include Armenians, Abkhazians, 
Ajarians, Ossetians and Tatars. The Georgians are

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 255 
at the head. Among some of the Georgian Communists 
the idea has sprung up and is gaining ground that there 
s no particular need to reckon with these small nationalities; 
they are less cultured, less developed, they say, 
and there is therefore no need to reckon with them. That 
is chauvinism‹harmful and dangerous chauvinism; for 
it may turn the small republic of Georgia into an arena 
of strife. In fact, it has already turned it into an arena 
of strife. 
Azerbaijan. The basic nationality here is the Azerbaijanian, 
but there are also Armenians. Among a section 
of the Azerbaijanians there is also a tendency, sometimes 
quite unconcealed, to think that the Azerbaijanians are 
the indigenous population and the Armenians intruders, 
and therefore, it is possible to push the Armenians somewhat 
into the background, to disregard their interests. 
That is chauvinism too. It undermines the equality of 
nationalities on which the Soviet system is based. 
Bukhara. In Bukhara there are three nationalities‹ 
Uzbeks, the basic nationality; Turkmenians, a ³less important² 
nationality from the point of view of Bukharan 
chauvinism; and Kirghiz, who are few in number 
here and, apparently, ³less important.² 
In Khorezm you have the same thing: Turkmenians and 
Uzbeks. The Uzbeks are the basic nationality and the 
Turkmenians ³less important.² 
All this leads to conflict and weakens the Soviet 
regime This tendency towards local chauvinism must also 
be cut off at the root. Of course, compared with Great- 
Russian chauvinism, which in the general scheme of the 
national question comprises three-quarters of the whole, 
local chauvinism is not so important; but for local work,

J. V. S T A L I N 256 
for the local people, for the peaceful development of the 
national republics themselves, this chauvinism is a matter 
of first-rate importance. 
Sometimes this chauvinism begins to undergo a very 
interesting evolution. I have in mind Transcaucasia. You 
know that Transcaucasia consists of three republics embracing 
ten nationalities. From very early times Transcaucasia 
has been an arena of massacre and strife and, 
under the Mensheviks and Dashnaks, it was an arena of 
war. You know of the Georgian-Armenian war. You also 
know of the massacres in Azerbaijan at the beginning and 
at the end of 1905. I could mention a whole list of districts 
where the Armenian majority massacred all the 
rest of the population, consisting of Tatars. Zangezur, 
for instance. I could mention another province‹Nakhichevan. 
There the Tatars predominated, and they massacred 
all the Armenians. That was just before the liberation 
of Armenia and Georgia from the yoke of imperialism. 
(Voice: ³That was their way of solving the national 
question.²) That, of course, is also a way of solving the 
national question. But it is not the Soviet way. Of course, 
the Russian workers are not to blame for this state of 
mutual national enmity, for it is the Tatars and Armenians 
who are fighting, without the Russians. That is 
why a special organ is required in Transcaucasia to 
regulate the relations between the nationalities. 
It may be confidently stated that the relations between 
the proletariat of the formerly dominant nation and 
the toilers of all the other nationalities constitute threequarters 
of the whole national question. But one-quarter 
of this question must be attributed to the relations between 
the formerly oppressed nationalities themselves.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 257 
And if in this atmosphere of mutual distrust the 
Soviet Government had failed to establish in Transcaucasia 
an organ of national peace capable of settling all 
friction and conflict, we would have reverted to the era 
of tsarism, or to the era of the Dashnaks, the Mussavatists, 
the Mensheviks, when people maimed and slaughtered 
one another. That is why the Central Committee 
has on three occasions affirmed the necessity of preserving 
the Transcaucasian Federation as an organ of national 
peace. 
There has been and still is a group of Georgian Communists 
who do not object to Georgia uniting with the 
Union of Republics, but who do object to this union being 
effected through the Transcaucasian Federation. They, 
you see, would like to get closer to the Union, they say 
that there is no need for this partition wall in the shape 
of the Transcaucasian Federation between themselves‹ 
the Georgians‹and the Union of Republics, the federation, 
they say, is superfluous. This, they think, sounds 
very revolutionary. 
But there is another motive behind this. In the first 
place, these statements indicate that on the national 
question the attitude towards the Russians is of secondary 
importance in Georgia, for these comrades, the 
deviators (that is what they are called), have no objection 
to Georgia joining the Union directly; that is, they 
do not fear Great-Russian chauvinism, believing that 
its roots have been cut in one way or another, or, at any 
rate, that it is not of decisive importance. Evidently, 
what they fear most is the federation of Transcaucasia. 
Why? Why should the three principal nations which inhabit 
Transcaucasia, which fought among themselves so

J. V. S T A L I N 258 
long, massacred each other and warred against each other, 
why should these nations, now that Soviet power has at 
last united them by bonds of fraternal union in the form 
of a federation, now that this federation has produced 
positive results, why should they now break these federal 
ties? What is the point, comrades? 
The point is that the bonds of the Transcaucasian 
Federation deprive Georgia of that somewhat privileged 
position which she could assume by virtue of her geographical 
position. Judge for yourselves. Georgia has her own 
port‹Batum‹through which goods flow from the West; 
Georgia has a railway junction like Tiflis, which the 
Armenians cannot avoid, nor can Azerbaijan avoid it, 
for she receives her goods through Batum. If Georgia 
were a separate republic, if she were not part of the Transcaucasian 
Federation, she could present something in 
the nature of a little ultimatum both to Armenia, which 
cannot do without Tiflis, and to Azerbaijan, which cannot 
do without Batum. There would be some advantages 
for Georgia in this. It was no accident that the notorious 
savage decree establishing frontier cordons was drafted 
in Georgia. Serebryakov is now being blamed for this. 
Let us allow that he is to blame, but the decree originated 
in Georgia, not in Azerbaijan or Armenia. 
Then there is yet another reason. Tiflis is the capital 
of Georgia, but the Georgians there are not more than 
30 per cent of the population, the Armenians not less 
than 35 per cent, and then come all the other nationalities. 
That is what the capital of Georgia is like. If Georgia 
were a separate republic the population could be reshifted 
somewhat‹for instance, the Armenian population could 
be shifted from Tiflis. Was not a well-known decree

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 259 
adopted in Georgia to ³regulate² the population of Tiflis, 
about which Comrade Makharadze said that it was not 
directed against the Armenians? The intention was to 
reshift the population so as to reduce the number of Armenians 
in Tiflis from year to year, making them fewer 
than the Georgians, and thus convert Tiflis into a real 
Georgian capital. I grant that they have rescinded the 
eviction decree, but they have a vast number of possibilities, 
a vast number of flexible forms‹such as ³decongestion²‹
by which it would be possible, while maintaining 
a semblance of internationalism, to arrange matters 
in such a way that Armenians in Tiflis would be in 
the minority. 
It is these geographical advantages that the Georgian 
deviators do not want to lose, and the unfavourable 
position of the Georgians in Tiflis itself, where there 
are fewer Georgians than Armenians, that are causing 
our deviators to oppose federation. The Mensheviks simply 
evicted Armenians and Tatars from Tiflis. Now, however, 
under the Soviet regime, eviction is impossible; 
therefore, they want to leave the federation, and this 
will create legal opportunities for independently performing 
certain operations which will result in the advantageous 
position enjoyed by the Georgians being fully 
utilised against Azerbaijan and Armenia. And all this 
would create a privileged position for the Georgians in 
Transcaucasia. Therein lies the whole danger. 
Can we ignore the interests of national peace in Transcaucasia 
and allow conditions to be created under which 
the Georgians would be in a privileged position in relation 
to the Armenian and Azerbaijanian Republics? No. 
We cannot allow that.

J. V. S T A L I N 260 
There is an old, special system of governing nations, 
under which a bourgeois authority favours certain nationalities, 
grants them privileges and humbles the other 
nations, not wishing to be bothered with them. Thus by 
favouring one nationality, it uses it to keep down the 
others. Such, for instance, was the method of government 
employed in Austria. Everyone remembers the statement 
of the Austrian Minister Beust, who summoned the Hungarian 
Minister and said: ³You govern your hordes and 
I will cope with mine.² In other words: you curb and keep 
down your nationalities in Hungary and I will keep down 
mine in Austria. You and I represent privileged nations, 
let¹s keep down the rest. 
The same was the case with the Poles in Austria itself. 
The Austrians favoured the Poles, granted them 
privileges, in order that the Poles should help the Austrians 
strengthen their position in Poland; and in return 
they allowed the Poles to strangle Galicia. 
This system of singling out some nationalities and 
granting them privileges in order to cope with the rest 
is purely and specifically Austrian. From the point of 
view of the bureaucracy, it is an ³economical² method 
of governing, because it has to bother only with one nationality; 
but from the political point of view it means 
certain death to the state, for to violate the principle 
of equality of nationalities and to grant privileges to 
any one nationality means dooming one¹s national policy 
to certain failure. 
Britain is now ruling India in exactly the same way. 
To make it easier, from the point of view of the bureaucracy, 
to deal with the nationalities and races of India, 
Britain divided India into British India (240,000,000

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 261 
population) and Native India (72,000,000 population). 
Why? Because Britain wanted to single out one group 
of nations and grant it privileges in order the more easily 
to govern the remaining nationalities. In India there 
are several hundred nationalities, and Britain decided 
that, rather than bother with these nationalities, it was 
better to single out a few nations, grant them certain privileges 
and through them govern the rest; for, firstly, 
the discontent of the other nations would be directed 
against these favoured ones and not against Britain, and, 
secondly, it would be cheaper to have to ³bother² with 
only two or three nations. 
That is also a system of governing, the British system. 
What does it lead to? To the ³cheapening² of the apparatus‹
that is true. But, comrades, leaving aside bureaucratic 
conveniences, it means certain death to British 
rule in India; this system harbours inevitable death, as 
surely as twice two make four, the death of British rule 
and British domination. 
It is on to this dangerous path that our comrades, 
the Georgian deviators, are pushing us by opposing federation 
in violation of all the laws of the Party, by wanting 
to withdraw from the federation in order to retain 
an advantageous position. They are pushing us on to the 
path of granting them certain privileges at the expense 
of the Armenian and Azerbaijanian Republics. But this 
is a path we cannot take, for it means certain death to 
our entire policy and to Soviet power in the Caucasus. 
It was no accident that our comrades in Georgia 
sensed this danger. This Georgian chauvinism, which had 
passed to the offensive against the Armenians and Azerbaijanians, 
alarmed the Communist Party of Georgia.

J. V. S T A L I N 262 
Quite naturally, the Communist Party of Georgia, which 
has held two congresses since it came into legal existence, 
on both occasions unanimously rejected the stand of the 
deviator comrades, for under present conditions it is 
impossible to maintain peace in the Caucasus, impossible 
to establish equality, without the Transcaucasian 
Federation. One nation must not be allowed more privileges 
than another. This our comrades have sensed. 
That is why, after two years of contention, the Mdivani 
group is a small handful, repeatedly ejected by the 
Party in Georgia itself. 
It was also no accident that Comrade Lenin was in 
such a hurry and was so insistent that the federation 
should be established immediately. Nor was it an accident 
that our Central Committee on three occasions affirmed 
the need for a federation in Transcaucasia, having 
its own Central Executive Committee and its own executive 
authority, whose decisions would be binding on the 
republics. It was no accident that both commissions‹ 
Comrade Dzerzhinsky¹s and that of Kamenev and Kuibyshev‹
on their arrival in Moscow stated that federation 
was indispensable. 
Lastly, it is no accident either that the Mensheviks 
of Sotsialistichesky Vestnik 69 praise our deviator comrades 
and laud them to the skies for opposing federation: 
birds of a feather flock together. 
I pass to an examination of the ways and means by 
which we must eliminate these three main factors that 
are hindering union: Great-Russian chauvinism, actual 
inequality of nations and local nationalism, particularly 
when it is growing into chauvinism. Of the means that 
may help us painlessly to rid ourselves of all this heri

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 263 
tage of the past which is hindering the peoples from coming 
together I shall mention three. 
The first means is to adopt all measures to make the 
Soviet regime understood and loved in the republics, to 
make the Soviet regime not only Russian but inter-national. 
For this it is necessary that not only the schools, but 
all institutions and all bodies, both Party and Soviet, 
should step by step be made national in character, that 
they should be conducted in the language that is understood 
by the masses, that they should function in conditions 
that correspond to the manner of life of the given 
nation. Only on this condition will we be able to convert 
the Soviet regime from a Russian into an inter-national 
one, understood by and near and dear to the labouring 
masses of all the republics, particularly those which 
are economically and culturally backward. 
The second means that can help us in painlessly 
getting rid of the heritage from tsarism and the bourgeoisie 
is to construct the Commissariats of the Union 
of Republics in such a way as to enable at least the principal 
nationalities to have their people on the collegiums, 
and to create a situation in which the needs and 
requirements of the individual republics will be met without 
fail. 
The third means: i t is necessary to have among 
our supreme central organs one that will serve to express 
the needs and requirements of all the republics and nationalities 
without exception. 
I want especially to draw your attention to this last 
means. 
If within the Central Executive Committee of the 
Union we could create two chambers having equal powers,

J. V. S T A L I N 264 
one of which would be elected at the Union Congress of 
Soviets, irrespective of nationality, and the other by 
the republics and national regions (the republics being 
equally represented, and the national regions also being 
equally represented) and endorsed by the same Congress 
of Soviets of the Union of Republics, I think that then 
our supreme institutions would express not only the class 
interests of all the working people without exception, 
but also purely national needs. We would have an organ 
which would express the special interests of the nationalities, 
peoples and races inhabiting the Union of Republics. 
Under the conditions prevailing in our Union, which 
as a whole unites not less than 140,000,000 people, of 
whom about 65,000,000 are non-Russians, in such a 
country it is impossible to govern unless we have with 
us, here in Moscow, in the supreme organ, emissaries of 
these nationalities, to express not only the interests 
common to the proletariat as a whole, but also special, 
specific, national interests. Without this it will be impossible 
to govern, comrades. Unless we have this barometer, 
and people capable of formulating these special needs 
of the individual nationalities, it will be impossible to 
govern. 
There are two ways of governing a country. One way 
is to have a ³simplified² apparatus, headed, say, by a 
group of people, or by one man, having hands and eyes 
in the localities in the shape of governors. This is a 
very simple form of government, under which the ruler, 
in governing the country, receives the kind of information 
that can be received from governors and comforts 
himself with the hope that he is governing honestly and 
well. Presently, friction arises, friction grows into con

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 265 
flicts and conflicts into revolts. Later, the revolts are 
crushed. Such a system of government is not our system, 
and in addition, although a simple one, it is too 
costly. But there is another system of government, the 
Soviet system. In our Soviet country we are operating 
this other system of government, the system which enables 
us to foresee with accuracy all changes, all the circumstances 
among the peasants, among the nationals, 
among the so-called ³aliens² and among the Russians; 
this system of supreme organs possesses a number of 
barometers which forecast every change, which register 
and warn against a Basmach movement,70 a bandit movement, 
Kronstadt, and all possible storms and disasters. 
That is the Soviet system of government. It is called 
Soviet power, people¹s power, because, relying on the 
common people, it is the first to register any change, it 
takes the appropriate measures and rectifies the line in 
time, if it has become distorted, criticises itself and rectifies 
the line. This system of government is the Soviet 
system, and it requires that the system of our higher 
agencies should include agencies expressing absolutely 
all national needs and requirements. 
The objection is made that this system will complicate 
the work of administration, that it means setting up 
more and more bodies. That is true. Hitherto we had the 
Central Executive Committee of the R.S.F.S.R., then we 
created the Central Executive Committee of the Union, 
and now we shall have to split the Central Executive 
Committee of the Union into two. But it can¹t be helped. 
I have already said that the simplest form of government 
is to have one man and to give him governors. But now, 
after the October Revolution, we cannot engage in such

J. V. S T A L I N 266 
experiments. The system has become more complex, but 
it makes government easier and lends the whole governmental 
system a profoundly Soviet character. That is why 
I think that the congress must agree to the establishment 
of a special body, a second chamber within the Central 
Executive Committee of the Union, since it is absolutely 
essential. 
I do not say that this is a perfect way of arranging 
co-operation between the peoples of the Union; I do not 
say that it is the last word in science. We shall put 
forward the national question again and again, for national 
and international conditions are changing, and 
may change again. I do not deny the possibility that 
perhaps some of the Commissariats that we are merging 
in the Union of Republics will have to be separated again 
if, after being merged, experience shows that they are 
unsatisfactory. But one thing is clear, namely, that 
under present conditions, and in the present circumstances, 
no better method and no more suitable organ 
is available. As yet we have no better way or means of 
creating an organ capable of registering all the oscillations 
and all the changes that take place within the individual 
republics than that of establishing a second 
chamber. 
It goes without saying that the second chamber must 
contain representatives not only of the four republics 
that have united, but of all the peoples; for the question 
concerns not only the republics which have formally united 
(there are four of them), but all the peoples and 
nationalities in the Union of Republics. We therefore 
require a form that will express the needs of all the nationalities 
and republics without exception.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 267 
I shall sum up, comrades. 
Thus, the importance of the national question is 
determined by the new situation in international affairs, 
by the fact that here, in Russia, in our federation we 
must solve the national question in a correct, a model 
way, in order to set an example to the East, which constitutes 
the heavy reserves of the revolution, and thereby 
increase their confidence in our federation and its 
attraction for them. 
From the standpoint of the internal situation, the 
conditions created by the N.E.P. and the growing Great- 
Russian chauvinism and local chauvinism also oblige 
us to emphasise the special importance of the national 
question. 
I said, further, that the essence of the national question 
lies in establishing correct relations between the 
proletariat of the formerly dominant nation and the peasantry 
of the formerly subject nations, and that from this 
point of view the concrete form of the national question 
at the present moment is expressed by having to find 
ways and means of arranging the co-operation of the 
peoples within a Union of Republics, within a single 
state. 
I spoke, further, of the factors which are conducive 
to such a coming together of the peoples. I spoke of the 
factors impeding such a union. I dwelt especially on 
Great-Russian chauvinism, as a force that is gaining in 
strength. That force is a basic danger, capable of undermining 
the confidence of the formerly oppressed peoples 
in the Russian proletariat. It is a most dangerous enemy, 
which we must overcome; for once we overcome it, 
we shall have overcome nine-tenths of the nationalism

J. V. S T A L I N 268 
which has survived, and which is growing in certain republics. 
Further. We are faced with the danger that certain 
groups of comrades may push us on to the path of granting 
privileges to some nationalities at the expense of 
others. I have said that we cannot take this path, because 
it may undermine national peace and kill the confidence 
of the masses of the other nations in Soviet power. 
I said, further, that the chief means that will enable 
us most painlessly to eliminate the factors that hinder 
union lies in the creation of a second chamber of 
the Central Executive Committee, of which I spoke more 
openly at the February Plenum of the Central Committee, 
and which is dealt with in the theses in a more veiled 
form in order to enable the comrades themselves, perhaps, 
to indicate some other more flexible form, some other 
more suitable organ, capable of expressing the interests 
of the nationalities. 
Such are the conclusions. 
I think that it is only in this way that we shall be 
able to achieve a correct solution of the national question, 
that we shall be able to unfurl widely the banner of the 
proletarian revolution and win for it the sympathy and 
confidence of the countries of the East, which are the 
heavy reserves of the revolution, and which can play a 
decisive role in the future battles of the proletariat against 
imperialism. (Applause.)

4. REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION 
ON THE REPORT ON NATIONAL FACTORS 
IN PARTY AND STATE AFFAIRS 
April 25 
Comrades, before proceeding to report on the work 
of the committee on the national question, permit me to 
deal with two main points in answer to the speakers in 
the discussion on my report. It will take about twenty 
minutes, not more. 
The first point is that a group of comrades headed 
by Bukharin and Rakovsky has over-emphasised the 
significance of the national question, has exaggerated it, 
and has allowed it to overshadow the social question, 
the question of working-class power. 
It is clear to us, as Communists, that the basis of 
all our work lies in strengthening the power of the workers, 
and that only after that are we confronted by the 
other question, a very important one but subordinate 
to the first, namely, the national question. We are told 
that we must not offend the non-Russian nationalities. 
That is perfectly true; I agree that we must not offend 
them. But to evolve out of this a new theory to 
the effect that the Great-Russian proletariat must be 
placed in a position of inequality in relation to the formerly 
oppressed nations is absurd. What was merely a 
figure of speech in Comrade Lenin¹s well-known article,

J. V. S T A L I N 270 
Bukharin has converted into a regular slogan. Nevertheless, 
it is clear that the political basis of the dictatorship 
of the proletariat is primarily and chiefly the central, 
industrial regions, and not the border regions, which 
are peasant countries. If we exaggerate the importance 
of the peasant border regions, to the detriment of the 
proletarian districts, it may result in a crack in the 
system of the dictatorship of the proletariat. That is 
dangerous, comrades. We must not exaggerate things in 
politics, just as we must not underrate them. 
It should be borne in mind that in addition to the 
right of nations to self-determination, there is also the 
right of the working class to consolidate its power, and 
the right of self-determination is subordinate to this latter 
right. There are cases when the right of self-determination 
conflicts with another, a higher right‹the right of the 
working class that has come to power to consolidate its 
power. In such cases‹this must be said bluntly‹the 
right of self-determination cannot and must not serve 
as an obstacle to the working class in exercising its right 
to dictatorship. The former must yield to the latter. 
That was the case in 1920, for instance, when in order 
to defend working-class power we were obliged to march 
on Warsaw. 
It must therefore not be forgotten when handing out 
all sorts of promises to the non-Russian nationalities, 
when bowing and scraping before the representatives of 
these nationalities, as certain comrades have done at 
the present congress, it must be borne in mind that, in 
our external and internal situation, the sphere of action 
of the national question and the limits of its jurisdiction, 
so to speak, are restricted by the sphere of action

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 271 
and jurisdiction of the ³labour question,² as the most 
fundamental question. 
Many speakers referred to notes and articles by Vladimir 
Ilyich. I do not want to quote my teacher, 
Comrade Lenin, since he is not here, and I am afraid 
that I might, perhaps, quote him wrongly and inappropriately. 
Nevertheless, I am obliged to quote one passage, 
which is axiomatic and can give rise to no misunderstanding, 
in order that no doubt should be left in the 
minds of comrades with regard to the relative importance 
of the national question. Analysing Marx¹s letter on 
the national question in an article on self-determination, 
Comrade Lenin draws the following conclusion: 
³Marx had no doubt about the subordinate significance of the 
national question as compared with the Œlabour question.¹²71 
Here are only two lines, but they are decisive. And 
that is what some of our comrades who are more zealous 
than wise should drill into their heads. 
The second point is about Great-Russian chauvinism 
and local chauvinism. Rakovsky and especially Bukharin 
spoke here, and the latter proposed that the clause dealing 
with the harmfulness of local chauvinism should 
be deleted. Their argument was that there is no need to 
bother with a little worm like local chauvinism when we 
are faced by a ³Goliath² like Great-Russian chauvinism. 
In general, Bukharin was in a repentant mood. That is 
natural: he has been sinning against the nationalities 
for years, denying the right to self-determination. It 
was high time for him to repent. But in repenting he 
went to the other extreme. It is curious that Bukharin 
calls upon the Party to follow his example and also

J. V. S T A L I N 272 
repent, although the whole world knows that the Party is 
in no way involved, for from its very inception (1898) 
it recognised the right to self-determination and therefore 
has nothing to repent of. The fact of the matter is 
that Bukharin has failed to understand the essence of the 
national question. When it is said that the fight against 
Great-Russian chauvinism must be made the corner-stone 
of the national question, the intention is to indicate the 
duties of the Russian Communist; it implies that it is 
the duty of the Russian Communist himself to combat 
Russian chauvinism. If the struggle against Russian chauvinism 
were undertaken not by the Russian but by the 
Turkestanian or Georgian Communists, it would be interpreted 
as anti-Russian chauvinism. That would confuse 
the whole issue and strengthen Great-Russian chauvinism. 
Only the Russian Communists can undertake the fight 
against Great-Russian chauvinism and carry it through 
to the end. 
And what is intended when a struggle against local 
chauvinism is proposed? The intention is to point to 
the duty of the local Communists, the duty of the non- 
Russian Communists, to combat their own chauvinists. 
Can the existence of deviations towards anti-Russian 
chauvinism be denied? Why, the whole congress has seen 
for itself that local chauvinism exists, Georgian, Bashkir 
and other chauvinism, and that it must be combated. 
Russian Communists cannot combat Tatar, Georgian or 
Bashkir chauvinism; if a Russian Communist were to 
undertake the difficult task of combating Tatar or Georgian 
chauvinism it would be regarded as a fight waged by 
a Great-Russian chauvinist against the Tatars or the 
Georgians. That would confuse the whole issue. Only the

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 273 
Tatar, Georgian and other Communists can fight Tatar, 
Georgian and other chauvinism; only the Georgian Communists 
can successfully combat Georgian nationalism 
or chauvinism. That is the duty of the non-Russian Communists. 
That is why it is necessary to refer in the theses 
to the double task, that of the Russian Communists (I 
refer to the fight against Great-Russian chauvinism) and 
that of the non-Russian Communists (I refer to their 
fight against anti-Armenian, anti-Tatar, anti-Russian 
chauvinism). Otherwise, the theses will be one-sided, 
there will be no internationalism, whether in state or 
Party affairs. 
If we combat only Great-Russian chauvinism, it will 
obscure the fight that is being waged by the Tatar and 
other chauvinists, a fight which is developing in the localities 
and which is especially dangerous now, under the 
conditions of the N.E.P. We cannot avoid fighting on 
two fronts, for we can achieve success only by fighting 
on two fronts‹on the one hand, against Great-Russian 
chauvinism, which is the chief danger in our work of construction, 
and, on the other hand, against local chauvinism; 
unless we wage this double fight there will be no solidarity 
between the Russian workers and peasants and the 
workers and peasants of the other nationalities. Failure 
to wage this fight may result in encouraging local 
chauvinism, a policy of pandering to local chauvinism, 
which we cannot allow. 
Permit me here too to quote Comrade Lenin. I would 
not have done so, but since there are many comrades at 
our congress who quote Comrade Lenin right and left and 
distort what he says, permit me to read a few words 
from a well-known article of his:

J. V. S T A L I N 274 
³The proletariat must demand freedom of political secession 
for the colonies and nations that are oppressed by Œits¹ nation. 
Unless it does this, proletarian internationalism will remain a 
meaningless phrase; neither mutual confidence nor class solidarity 
between the workers of the oppressing and the oppressed nations 
will be possible.²72 
These are, so to say, the duties of proletarians of the 
dominant or formerly dominant nation. Then he goes on 
to speak of the duties of proletarians or Communists of 
the formerly oppressed nations: 
³On the other hand, the Socialists of the oppressed nations 
must particularly fight for and put into effect complete and absolute 
unity, including organisational unity, between the workers 
of the oppressed nation and the workers of the oppressing nation. 
Otherwise, it is impossible to uphold the independent policy of 
the proletariat and its class solidarity with the proletariat of 
other countries against all the subterfuges, treachery and trickery 
of the bourgeoisie. For the bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations 
constantly converts the slogans of national liberation into a means 
for deceiving the workers.² 
As you see, if we are to follow in Comrade Lenin¹s 
footsteps‹and some comrades here have sworn by him‹ 
both theses must be retained in the resolution‹both 
the thesis on combating Great-Russian chauvinism and 
that on combating local chauvinism‹as two aspects of 
one phenomenon, as theses on combating chauvinism 
in general. 
With this I conclude my answers to those who have 
spoken here. 
Permit me now to report on the work of the committee 
on the national question. The committee took the Central 
Committee¹s theses as a basis. It left six points of these 
theses, namely, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, entirely unaltered.

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
275 
There was a dispute in the committee, primarily, on the 
question whether or not the autonomous republics should 
first be taken out of the R.S.F.S.R. and the independent 
republics in the Caucasus out of the Transcaucasian 
Federation, in order that they should then join the Union 
of Republics individually. This was the proposal of a 
section of the Georgian comrades, but, as is known, it 
is a proposal which meets with no sympathy from the 
Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijanian delegations. The 
committee discussed this question and by an overwhelming 
majority decided in favour of retaining the 
proposition given in the theses, namely, that the 
R.S.F.S.R. should remain an integral unit, that the 
Transcaucasian Federation should also remain an integral 
unit and each should enter the Union of Republics as 
such. Not all the proposals submitted by this section 
of the Georgian comrades were put to the vote, because, 
seeing that the proposals met with no sympathy, their 
authors withdrew them. The dispute on this question 
was a serious one. 
The second question on which there was a dispute was 
the question how the second chamber should be constituted. 
One section of the comrades (the minority) proposed 
that the second chamber should not consist of representatives 
of all the republics, nationalities and regions, 
but that it should be based on the representation of four 
republics, namely: the R.S.F.S.R., the Transcaucasian 
Federation, Byelorussia and the Ukraine. The majority 
rejected this proposal and the committee decided against 
it on the grounds that it would be more advisable to 
form the second chamber on the principle of equal representation 
of all the republics (both independent and 
THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.)

J. V. S T A L I N 276 
autonomous) and of all national regions. I shall not 
present the arguments on this point, for Rakovsky, the 
representative of the minority, intends to speak here in 
order to substantiate his proposal, which the committee 
rejected. After he has spoken I shall present my arguments. 
There was also a dispute, not very heated, on the 
question whether the theses should be amended so as to 
point to the necessity of looking to the West as well as 
to the East in solving the national question. This amendment 
was put to the vote. It was the minority¹s amendment, 
moved by Rakovsky, The committee rejected it. 
I shall speak on this question too after Rakovsky has 
spoken. 
I shall read the amendments that we accepted. Six 
points were adopted as they stood. In Point 7, paragraph 
2, line 3, before the words: ³Hence, our Party¹s first immediate 
task is vigorously to combat,² the following 
is to be inserted: 
³The situation in a number of national republics 
(Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Turkestan) is complicated 
by the fact that a considerable section of the working 
class, which is the main bulwark of the Soviet system, 
belongs to the Great-Russian nationality. In these districts 
the establishment of the bond between town and 
country, between the working class and the peasantry, 
encounters extremely powerful obstacles in the shape of 
survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism in both Party 
and Soviet organs. Under these circumstances, talk about 
the superiority of Russian culture, and advancement 
of the argument that the higher Russian culture must 
inevitably triumph over the culture of the more back

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 277 
ward peoples (Ukrainian, Azerbaijanian, Uzbek, Kirghiz, 
etc.) are nothing but an attempt to perpetuate the 
domination of the Great-Russian nationality.² 
I accepted this amendment because it improves the 
theses. 
The second amendment also relates to Point 7. Before 
the words: ³Otherwise there can be no grounds for 
expecting,² the following is to be added: 
³This assistance must find expression primarily in 
the adoption of a number of practical measures for forming 
in the republics of the formerly oppressed nationalities 
industrial centres with the maximum participation 
of the local population. Lastly, in conformity with 
the resolution of the Tenth Congress, this assistance must 
be accompanied by a struggle of the labouring masses 
to strengthen their own social positions in opposition 
to the local and immigrant exploiting upper sections, 
which are growing as a consequence of the N.E.P. Since 
these republics are mainly agricultural districts, the internal 
social measures must consist primarily in allotting 
the labouring masses land out of the available state land 
fund.² 
Further, in the same Point 7, middle of paragraph 
2, where it speaks of Georgian chauvinism, Azerbaijanian 
chauvinism, etc., insert: ³Armenian chauvinism, 
etc.² The Armenian comrades did not want the Armenians 
to be left out in the cold, they wanted their chauvinism 
to be mentioned too. 
Further, in Point 8 of the theses, after the words 
³one and indivisible,² insert: 
³We must regard as a similar heritage of the past 
the striving of some of the government departments of

J. V. S T A L I N 278 
the R.S.F.S.R. to subordinate to themselves the independent 
Commissariats of the autonomous republics and 
to prepare the ground for the liquidation of the latter.² 
Further in Point 8, insert: 
³and proclaiming the absolute necessity of the 
existence and further development of the national republics.² 
Further, Point 9. It should begin as follows: 
³The Union of Republics, formed on the principles 
of equality and voluntary consent of the workers and 
peasants of the various republics, is the first experiment 
of the proletariat in regulating the mutual international 
relations of independent countries, and the first step 
towards the creation of the future World Soviet Republic 
of Labour.² 
Point 10 has a sub-point ³a²; a new sub-point ³a² 
was inserted before it, in the following terms: 
³a) in the building up of the central organs of the 
Union, equality of rights and duties of the individual 
republics should be ensured both in their relations with 
one another and in their relations with the central authority 
of the Union.² 
Then follows sub-point ³b², worded as the former 
sub-point ³a²: 
³b) within the system of higher organs of the Union 
a special organ should be instituted that will represent 
all the national republics and national regions without 
exception on the basis of equality, providing as far as 
possible for the representation of all the nationalities 
within these republics.² 
Then comes what was sub-point ³b² and is now subpoint 
³c², worded as follows:

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 279 
³c) the executive organs of the Union should be constructed 
on principles that will ensure the actual participation 
in them of representatives of the republics and 
the satisfaction of the needs and requirements of the peoples 
of the Union.² 
Then comes sub-point ³d², an addendum: 
³d) the republics should be accorded sufficiently 
wide financial and, in particular, budgetary powers, 
enabling them to display initiative in state administration 
and cultural and economic matters.² 
Then comes the former sub-point ³c² as sub-point e². 
³e) the organs of the national republics and regions 
should be staffed mainly with people from among the 
local inhabitants who know the language, manner of 
life, habits and customs of the peoples concerned.² 
Further, a second sub-point has been added, namely, 
³f²: 
³f) special laws should be passed ensuring the use 
of the native languages in all state organs and in all 
institutions serving the local and national population 
and national minorities‹laws that will prosecute and 
punish with all revolutionary severity all violators of 
national rights, particularly the rights of national minorities.² 
Then comes sub-point ³g², an addendum: 
³g) educational activities in the Red Army should 
be increased with the aim of inculcating the ideas 
of the fraternity and solidarity of the peoples of 
the Union, and the adoption of practical measures to 
organise national military units, all precautions to be 
taken to ensure the complete defensive capacity of the 
republics.²

J. V. S T A L I N 280 
Such are all the addenda that were adopted by the committee 
and to which I have no objection, since they make 
the theses more concrete. 
As regards Part II, no really important amendments 
were introduced. There were some slight amendments, 
which the commission elected by the committee on the 
national question decided to refer to the future Central 
Committee. 
Thus, Part II remains in the shape in which it was 
distributed in the printed materials.

5. ANSWER TO THE AMENDMENTS 
TO THE RESOLUTION 
April 25 
Although Rakovsky has changed two-thirds of the 
resolution he moved in the committee and has cut it down 
to a quarter, I am nevertheless emphatically opposed 
to his amendment, and for the following reason. Our 
theses on the national question are constructed in such 
a way that we, as it were, turn to face the East, having 
in view the heavy reserves that are latent there. We have 
linked the entire national question with the article of 
Ilyich, who, as far as I know, does not say a single word 
about the West, because the centre of the national question 
does not lie there, but in the colonies and semicolonies 
of the East. Rakovsky argues that, having turned 
towards the East, we must also turn towards the West. 
But that is impossible, comrades, and unnatural, because, 
as a rule, people face either one way or another; it 
is impossible to face two ways at the same time. We cannot 
and must not upset the general tone of the theses, 
their Eastern tone. That is why I think that Rakovsky¹s 
amendment should be rejected. 
* 
* 
* 
I regard this amendment as being of cardinal significance. 
I must say that if the congress accepts it, the 
theses will be turned upside down. Rakovsky proposes

J. V. S T A L I N 282 
that the second chamber be constructed in such a way 
that it should consist of representatives of state entities. 
He regards the Ukraine as a state entity, but not Bashkiria. 
Why? We are not abolishing the Councils of People¹s 
Commissars in the republics. Is not the Central 
Executive Committee of Bashkiria a state institution?! 
Then why is Bashkiria not a state? Will the Ukraine 
cease to be a state after she has entered the Union? State 
fetishism has confused Rakovsky. Since the nationalities 
have equal rights, since they have their own languages, 
habits, manner of life and customs, since these 
nationalities have set up their own state institutions‹ 
Central Executive Committees and Councils of People¹s 
Commissars‹is it not obvious that all these national 
units are state entities? I think that we cannot depart 
from the principle of equality between the republics and 
nationalities in the second chamber, particularly in relation 
to the Eastern nationalities. 
Evidently, Rakovsky is captivated by the Prussian 
system of federation. The German federation is built 
in such a way that there is no equality whatever between 
the states. I propose that we should arrange matters in 
such a way that in addition to class representation‹I 
mean the first chamber, which is to be elected at the All- 
Union Congress of Soviets‹we should have representation 
of the nationalities on the basis of equality. The Eastern 
peoples, which are organically connected with China, 
with India, being connected with them by language, 
religion, customs, etc., are of primary importance 
for the revolution. The relative importance of these 
small nationalities is much higher than that of the 
Ukraine.

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 283 
If we make a slight mistake in the Ukraine, the effect 
upon the East will not be great. But we have only to make 
one slight mistake in a small country, in Ajaristan 
(120,000 population), for the effect to be felt in Turkey, 
to be felt in the whole of the East, for Turkey is most 
closely connected with the East. We have only to commit 
a slight mistake in the small Kalmyk Region, the 
inhabitants of which are connected with Tibet and China, 
for the effect on our work to be far worse than that of 
a mistake committed in relation to the Ukraine. We are 
faced with the prospect of a mighty movement in the 
East, and we must direct our work primarily towards 
rousing the East and avoid doing anything that could 
even remotely, even indirectly, belittle the importance 
of any, even the smallest, individual nationality in the 
Eastern border regions. That is why I think that i t 
would be more just, more expedient and of greater advantage 
for the revolution from the standpoint of governing 
a big country like the Union of Republics with a population 
of 140,000,000, it would be better, I say, to arrange 
matters so that in the second chamber there should 
be equal representation of all the republics and national 
regions. We have eight autonomous republics and also 
eight independent republics; Russia will join as a republic, 
we have fourteen regions. All these will constitute 
the second chamber that will express all the requirements 
and needs of the nationalities and facilitate the 
government of such a big country. That is why I think 
that Rakovsky¹s amendment should be rejected.

6. SUPPLEMENT TO THE REPORT 
OF THE COMMISSION 
ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
April 25 
Comrades, when reporting to you on the work of 
the committee on the national question I forgot to mention 
two other small addenda, which certainly must be 
mentioned. To paragraph 10, point ³b², where it says 
that a special organ should be instituted that will represent 
all the national republics and national regions 
without exception on the basis of equality, it is necessary 
to add: ³providing as far as possible for all the nationalities 
within these republics,² because in some of 
the republics that will be represented in the second chamber 
there are several nationalities. For example, Turkestan. 
There, in addition to Uzbeks, there are Turkmenians, 
Kirghiz and other nationalities, and the representation 
must he so arranged that each of these nationalities 
is represented. 
The second addendum is to Part II, at the very end. 
It reads: 
³In view of the tremendous importance of the activities 
of responsible workers in the autonomous and independent 
republics, and in the border regions in general 
(the establishment of contact between the working people 
in the given republic and the working people in the 
whole of the rest of the Union), the congress instructs

THE TWELFTH CONGRESS OF THE R.C.P.(B.) 285 
the Central Committee to be particularly careful that 
such responsible workers are selected as will fully ensure 
the actual implementation of the Party¹s decisions 
on the national question.² 
And now a word or two about a remark Radek made 
in his speech. I am saying this at the request of the Armenian 
comrades. In my opinion that remark is contrary 
to the facts. Radek said here that the Armenians oppress, 
or might oppress, the Azerbaijanians in Azerbaijan and, 
vice versa, the Azerbaijanians might oppress the Armenians 
in Armenia. I must say that such things do not 
happen. The opposite happens: in Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijanians, 
being the majority, oppress the Armenians 
and massacre them, as happened in Nakhichevan, where 
nearly all the Armenians were massacred; and the Armenians 
in Armenia massacred nearly all the Tatars. 
That happened in Zangezur. As for the minority in a 
foreign state oppressing the people who belong to the 
majority‹such unnatural things have never happened.

THE PRESS AS A COLLECTIVE 
ORGANISER 
In his article ³To the Roots² (see Pravda, No. 98), 
Ingulov touched upon the important question of the significance 
of the press for the state and the Party. Evidently, 
in order to reinforce his view he referred to the 
Central Committee¹s organisational report, where it says 
that the press ³establishes an imperceptible link between 
the Party and the working class, a link which is as strong 
as any mass transmission apparatus,² that ³the press 
is a most powerful weapon by means of which the Party 
daily, hourly, speaks to the working class.²* 
But in his attempt to solve the problem, Ingulov 
made two mistakes: firstly, he distorted the meaning of 
the passage from the Central Committee¹s report; secondly, 
he lost sight of the very important role that the press 
plays as an organiser. I think that, in view of the importance 
of the question, a word or two should be said about 
these mistakes. 
1. The meaning of the report is not that the Party¹s 
role is confined to speaking to the working class, whereas 
the Party should converse with and not only speak to it. 
* See this volume, p. 206.‹Ed.

THE PRESS AS A COLLECTIVE ORGANISER 287 
This contrasting of the formula ³speak to² to the formula 
³converse with² is nothing more than mere juggling. 
In practice the two constitute an indissoluble whole, expressed 
in continuous interaction between the reader and 
the writer, between the Party and the working class, 
between the state and the masses of the working people. 
This has been taking place from the very inception 
of the mass proletarian party, from the time of the old 
Iskra. Ingulov is wrong in thinking that this interaction 
began only a few years after the working class had taken 
power in Russia. The point of the passage quoted from 
the Central Committee¹s report does not lie in ³speaking,² 
but in the fact that the press ³establishes a link 
between the Party and the working class,² a link ³which 
is as strong as any mass transmission apparatus.² The 
point of the passage lies in the organisational significance 
of the press. That is precisely why the press, as 
one of the transmission belts between the Party and the 
working class, was included in the Central Committee¹s 
organisational report. Ingulov failed to understand the 
passage and involuntarily distorted its meaning. 
2. Ingulov emphasises the role of the press in agitation 
and in the exposure of abuses, believing that the 
function of the periodical press is confined to this. He 
refers to a number of abuses in our country and argues 
that exposure in the press, agitation through the press, 
is the ³root² of the problem. It is clear, however, that 
important as the agitational role of the press may be, 
at the present moment its organisational role is the most 
vital factor in our work of construction. The point is 
not only that a newspaper must agitate and expose, 
but primarily that i t must have a wide network of

J. V. S T A L I N 288 
collaborators, agents and correspondents all over the 
country, in all industrial and agricultural centres, in all 
uyezds and volosts, so that threads should run from the 
Party through the newspaper to all the working-class and 
peasant districts without exception, so that the interaction 
between the Party and the state on the one hand, and 
the industrial and peasant districts on the other, should 
be complete. If a popular newspaper such as, let us say, 
Bednota73 were, from time to time, to call conferences 
of its principal agents in different parts of our country 
for the purpose of exchanging opinions and of summing 
up experience, and if each of these agents, in his turn, 
were to call conferences of his correspondents in his 
districts, centres and volosts for the same purpose, that 
would be a first important step forward not only in establishing 
organisational connection between the Party 
and the working class, between the state and the most 
remote parts of our country, but also in improving and 
enlivening the press itself, in improving and enlivening 
all the staffs of our periodical press. In my opinion, such 
conferences are of far more real importance than ³all- 
Russian² and other congresses of journalists. To make 
the newspapers collective organisers on behalf of the 
Party and the Soviet regime, a means of establishing 
connection with the masses of the working people in 
our country and of rallying them around the Party and 
the Soviet regime‹such is now the immediate task of 
the press. 
It will not be superfluous to remind the reader of 
a few lines in Comrade Lenin¹s article ³Where To Begin² 
(written in 1901) on the organising role of the periodical 
press in the life of our Party:

THE PRESS AS A COLLECTIVE ORGANISER 289 
³The role of a newspaper is not limited, however, merely 
to the spreading of ideas, merely to political education and attracting 
political allies. A newspaper is not only a collective propagandist 
and collective agitator, but also a collective organiser. 
In this respect it can be compared to the scaffolding erected around 
a building in construction, which marks the contours of the 
structure, facilitates communication between the builders and 
permits them to distribute the work and to view the common 
results achieved by their organised labour. With the aid of and 
in connection with a newspaper there will automatically develop 
a permanent organisation that will engage not only in local but 
also in regular general activities, training its members carefully 
to watch political events, to appraise their significance and the 
influence they exercise upon various strata of the population, 
and to devise suitable means by which the revolutionary Party 
could influence these events. The technical task alone‹of ensuring 
a regular supply of copy for the newspaper and its proper 
distribution‹will make it necessary to create a network of local 
agents of the united Party, agents who will have live contact with 
one another, who will be acquainted with the general state of 
affairs, get accustomed to carrying out regularly the detailed functions 
of all-Russian work and test their strength in the organisation 
of various revolutionary actions. This network of agents will 
form the skeleton of precisely the organisation we need, namely, 
one that is sufficiently large to embrace the whole country; sufficiently 
wide and many-sided to effect a strict and detailed division 
of labour; sufficiently tried and tempered to be able unswervingly 
to carry on its own work under all circumstances, at all 
Œturns,¹ and in all contingencies; sufficiently flexible to be able to 
avoid open battle against an enemy of overwhelming strength, 
when he has concentrated all his forces at one spot, and yet able 
to take advantage of the unwieldiness of this enemy and to attack 
him when and where least expected.²74 
At that time Comrade Lenin spoke of a newspaper as 
an instrument for building our Party. But there are no 
grounds for doubting that what Comrade Lenin said is

J. V. S T A L I N 290 
wholly applicable to the present conditions of our Party 
and state affairs. 
In his article, Ingulov lost sight of this important 
organising role of the periodical press. That is his chief 
mistake. 
How could it happen that one of our principal press 
workers lost sight of this important function? Yesterday, 
a comrade said to me that, apparently, in addition to 
the aim of solving the problem of the press, Ingulov had 
another aim, an ulterior one, namely, ³to hit at someone, 
and to do a good turn to someone else.² I myself 
do not undertake to say that this is so, and I am far from 
denying the right of anyone to set himself ulterior aims 
in addition to immediate ones. But ulterior aims must 
not for a moment be allowed to obscure the immediate 
task of revealing the organising role of the press in our 
Party and state affairs.

CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED . . . 
In my article in Pravda, No. 99* on the organising 
role of the press, I pointed to two mistakes that Ingulov 
made on the question of the press. In his article in reply 
(see Pravda, No. 101), Ingulov makes the excuse that 
his were not mistakes, but ³misunderstandings.² I am 
willing to call Ingulov¹s mistakes ³misunderstandings.² 
The trouble is, however, that Ingulov¹s rejoinder contains 
three new mistakes, or, if you like, three new ³misunderstandings,² 
which, unfortunately, cannot possibly 
be ignored in view of the special importance of the press. 
1. Ingulov asserts that in his first article he did 
not consider it necessary to concentrate on the question 
of the organising role of the press, and that he pursued 
a ³limited aim,² namely, of ascertaining ³who makes 
our Party newspaper.² All right. But, in that case, why 
did Ingulov quote as a heading to his article a passage 
from the Central Committee¹s organisational report, a 
passage which speaks exclusively about the organising 
role of our periodical press? One thing or the other: either 
Ingulov did not understand the meaning of the 
passage, or he built his entire article in despite of and 
* See this volume, pp. 286-90.‹Ed.

J. V. S T A L I N 292 
running counter to the precise meaning of the passage 
from the Central Committee¹s organisational report concerning 
the organising significance of the press. In either 
case, Ingulov¹s mistake is glaring. 
2. Ingulov asserts that ³two or three years ago our 
press was not connected with the masses,² ³did not connect 
the Party with them,² that, in general, connections 
between the press and the masses ³did not exist.² It is 
sufficient to read this assertion of Ingulov¹s carefully 
to realise how utterly incongruous, lifeless and divorced 
from reality it is. Indeed, if our Party press, and through 
it the Party itself, ³had not been connected² with the 
masses of the workers ³two or three years ago,² is it not 
obvious that our Party would not have been able to withstand 
the internal and external enemies of the revolution, 
that it would have been buried, reduced to nothing, ³in 
no time²? Just think: the Civil War is at its height, the 
Party is beating off the enemy, gaining a number of 
brilliant successes; the Party, through the press, calls 
upon the workers and peasants to defend their socialist 
homeland; tens, hundreds of thousands of working people 
respond to the Party¹s call in hundreds of resolutions 
and go to the front, ready to sacrifice their lives; but 
Ingulov, knowing all this, nevertheless finds it possible 
to assert that ³two or three years ago our press was 
not connected with the masses, and consequently, did not 
connect the Party with them.² Isn¹t that ridiculous? 
Have you ever heard of a Party ³not connected with the 
masses² through a mass press being able to rouse into 
action tens and hundreds of thousands of workers and 
peasants? But since the Party, nevertheless, did rouse 
into action tens and hundreds of thousands of working

CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED 293 
people, is it not obvious that the mass party could not possibly 
have done that without the aid of the press? Yes, 
somebody certainly did lose contact with the masses, but 
it was not our Party and not its press; it was somebody 
else. The press must not be maligned! The fact of the 
matter is that the Party certainly was connected with 
the masses through its press ³two or three years ago,² 
and it could not have been otherwise; but that connection 
was comparatively weak, as was justly noted by the Eleventh 
Congress of our Party. The task now is to widen 
this connection, to strengthen it in every way, to make 
it firmer and more regular. That is the whole point. 
3. Ingulov asserts further that ³two or three years 
ago there was no interaction between the Party and 
the working class through the press.² Why? Because, it 
appears, at that time ³our press, day after day, issued 
a call to struggle, reported the measures taken by the 
Soviet Government and the decisions of the Party, but 
there was no response from the working-class reader.² 
That is what he says: ³there was no response from the 
working-class reader.² 
It is incredible, monstrous, but it is a fact. 
Everybody knows that when the Party issued through 
the press the call ³All to aid transport!² the masses responded 
unanimously, sent hundreds of resolutions to 
the press expressing sympathy and readiness to uphold 
the transport system, and sent tens of thousands of their 
sons to maintain it. But Ingulov does not agree to regard 
this as a response of the working-class reader, he does not 
agree to call it interaction between the Party and the 
working class through the press, because this interaction 
took place not so much through correspondents as

J. V. S T A L I N 294 
directly between the Party and the working class, through 
the press, of course. 
Everybody knows that when the Party issued the call 
³Fight the famine!² the masses unanimously responded 
to the Party¹s call, sent innumerable resolutions to the 
Party press, and sent tens of thousands of their sons to 
fight the kulaks. Ingulov, however, does not agree to 
regard this as a response of the working-class reader and 
as interaction between the Party and the working class 
through the press, because this interaction did not take 
place ³according to rule,² certain correspondents were 
by-passed, etc. 
It turns out, according to Ingulov, that if tens and 
hundreds of thousands of workers respond to the call of 
the Party press, that is not interaction between the Party 
and the working class, but if in response to the same call 
the Party press receives written replies from a score or so 
of correspondents, that is real, genuine interaction between 
the Party and the working class. And that is called 
defining the organising role of the Party press! For God¹s 
sake, Ingulov, don¹t confuse the Marxist interpretation 
of interaction with the bureaucratic interpretation. 
If, however, interaction between the Party and the 
working class through the press is looked at through the 
eyes of a Marxist, and not of a bureaucrat, it will be 
clear that this interaction has always taken place, both 
³two or three years ago,² and before that, and it could 
not but take place, for otherwise the Party could not have 
retained the leadership of the working class, and the working 
class could not have retained power. Obviously, the 
point now is to make this interaction more continuous and 
lasting. Ingulov not only underrated the organising signif

CONFUSION WORSE CONFOUNDED 295 
icance of the press, he also misrepresented it, replacing 
the Marxist conception of interaction between the Party 
and the working class through the press by the bureaucratic, 
superficially technical conception. And this is what 
he would call a ³misunderstanding.² . . . 
As regards Ingulov¹s ³ulterior aims,² which he emphatically 
denies, I must say that his second article has 
not dispelled the doubts on that score that I expressed in 
my previous article.

FOURTH CONFERENCE OF THE CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE OF THE R.C.P. (B.) 
WITH RESPONSIBLE WORKERS OF THE 
NATIONAL REPUBLICS AND REGIONS75 
June 19-12, 1923 
Fourth Conference of the 
Central Committee of the R.C.P. With 
Responsible Workers of the 
National Republics and Regions. 
Verbatim Report, 
Moscow, 1923


1. DRAFT PLATFORM 
ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
FOR THE FOURTH CONFERENCE, 
ENDORSED BY THE POLITICAL BUREAU 
OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE76 
THE GENERAL LINE OF PARTY WORK 
ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
The line of Party work on the national question as 
regards combating deviations from the position adopted 
by the Twelfth Party Congress must be defined by the 
relevant points of the resolution on the national question 
adopted by that congress, namely, Point 7 of Part I of 
the resolution, and Points 1, 2 and 3 of Part II. 
One of the Party¹s fundamental tasks is to rear and 
develop in the national republics and regions young 
communist organisations consisting of proletarian and 
semi-proletarian elements of the local population; to do 
everything to assist these organisations to stand firmly 
on their feet, to acquire real communist education and 
to unite the genuinely internationalist communist cadres, 
even though they may be few at first. The Soviet regime 
will be strong in the republics and regions only when 
really important communist organisations are firmly 
established there. 
But the Communists themselves in the republics and 
regions must bear in mind that the situation there, if 
only because of the different social composition of the

J. V. S T A L I N 300 
population, is markedly different from the situation in 
the industrial centres of the Union of Republics and that, 
for this reason, it is often necessary to employ different 
methods of work in the border regions. In particular, 
here, in the endeavour to win the support of the labouring 
masses of the local population, it is necessary to 
a larger extent than in the central regions to meet halfway 
the revolutionary democratic elements, or even 
those who are simply loyal in their attitude to the Soviet 
regime. The role of the local intelligentsia in the republics 
and regions differs in many respects from that 
of the intelligentsia in the central regions of the Union 
of Republics. There are so few local intellectual workers 
in the border regions that all efforts must be made to 
win every one of them to the side of the Soviet regime. 
A Communist in the border regions must remember 
that he is a Communist and therefore, acting in conformity 
with the local conditions, must make concessions 
to those local national elements who are willing 
and able to work loyally within the framework of the 
Soviet system. This does not preclude, but, on the contrary, 
presupposes a systematic ideological struggle for 
the principles of Marxism and for genuine internationalism, 
and against a deviation towards nationalism. 
Only in this way will it be possible successfully to eliminate 
local nationalism and win broad strata of the 
local population to the side of the Soviet regime.

FOURTH CONFERENCE 301 
QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE INSTITUTION 
OF A SECOND CHAMBER OF THE CENTRAL 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE UNION AND WITH 
THE ORGANISATION OF THE PEOPLE¹S 
COMMISSARIATS OF THE UNION OF REPUBLICS 
Judging by as yet incomplete data, there are in all 
seven such questions: 
a) The composition of the second chamber. This chamber 
must consist of representatives of the autonomous 
and independent republics (four or more from each) and 
of representatives of the national regions (one from each 
will be enough). It is desirable that matters be arranged 
in such a way that members of the first chamber should 
not, as a rule, be at the same time members of the second 
chamber. The representatives of the republics and regions 
must be endorsed by the Congress of Soviets of the Union 
of Republics. The first chamber should be called the 
Union Soviet, the second‹the Soviet of Nationalities. 
b) The rights of the second chamber in relation to the 
first. The two chambers should have equal rights, each 
having power to initiate legislation, with the proviso 
that no Bill introduced in either of the chambers can 
become law unless it receives the consent of both chambers, 
voting separately. In the event of disagreement, 
the questions in dispute should be referred to a conciliation 
commission of the two chambers, and if no agreement 
is reached they should be put to another vote 
at a joint sitting of the two chambers. If the disputed 
Bill thus amended fails to obtain a majority of the two 
chambers, the matter should be referred to a special or 
to an ordinary Congress of Soviets of the Union of Republics.

J. V. S T A L I N 302 
c) The jurisdiction of the second chamber. The questions 
to come within the jurisdiction of the second (as 
of the first) chamber are indicated in Point 1 of the 
Constitution of the U.S.S.R. The legislative functions 
of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of 
the Union and of the Council of People¹s Commissars 
of the Union are to remain in force. 
d) The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee 
of the Union of Republics. There should be one Presidium 
of the Central Executive Committee. It should be elected 
by both chambers of the Central Executive Committee, 
provision being made, of course, for representation of 
the nationalities, at least for the largest ones. The proposal 
of the Ukrainians for setting up two presidiums 
with legislative functions, one for each chamber of the 
Central Executive Committee, in place of a single Presidium 
of the Central Executive Committee of the Union, 
is inadvisable. The Presidium is the supreme authority in 
the Union, functioning constantly, continuously, from session 
to session. The formation of two presidiums with 
legislative functions would mean a divided supreme authority, 
and this would inevitably create great difficulties 
in practice. The chambers should have their presidiums, 
which, however, should not possess legislative functions. 
e) The number of merged Commissariats. In conformity 
with the decisions of previous plenums of the Central 
Committee, there should be five merged Commissariats 
(Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, War, Transport, and 
Posts and Telegraphs), and also five directive Commissariats 
(People¹s Commissariat of Finance, Supreme 
Council of National Economy, People¹s Commissariat of 
Food, People¹s Commissariat of Labour, Workers¹ and

FOURTH CONFERENCE 303 
Peasants¹ Inspection), the rest of the Commissariats 
should be quite autonomous. The Ukrainians propose 
that the Commissariats of Foreign Affairs and of Foreign 
Trade be transferred from the merged to the directive 
category, i.e., that these Commissariats be left in the 
republics parallel with the Union Commissariats of Foreign 
Affairs and of Foreign Trade, but subordinate to 
their directives. This proposal cannot be accepted, if 
we are really going to form a single Union State capable 
of coming before the outside world as a united whole. 
The same must be said about concession agreements, 
the conclusion of which must be concentrated in the 
Union of Republics. 
f) The structure of the People¹s Commissariats of the 
Union of Republics. The collegiums of these People¹s 
Commissariats should be enlarged by the inclusion of 
representatives of the biggest and most important nationalities. 
g) The budget rights of the republics. The republics 
should be given more independence in regard to their 
budgets, within the limits of the share allotted to them, 
the dimensions of the share to be specially determined. 
MEASURES FOR DRAWING WORKING PEOPLE 
OF THE LOCAL POPULATION IN TO PARTY 
AND SOVIET AFFAIRS 
Judging by incomplete data, it is already possible 
to propose four measures: 
a) To purge the state and Party apparatuses of nationalist 
elements (this refers primarily to the Great-Russian 
nationalists, but it also refers to the anti-Russian

J. V. S T A L I N 304 
and other nationalists). The purge must be carried out 
with caution, on the basis of proved data, under the control 
of the Central Committee of the Party. 
b) To conduct systematic and persevering work to 
make the state and Party institutions in the republics 
and regions national in character, i.e., gradually to 
introduce the local languages in the conduct of affairs, 
making it obligatory for responsible workers to learn 
the local languages. 
c) To choose and enlist for the Soviet institutions 
the more or less loyal elements among the local intelligentsia. 
At the same time our responsible workers in 
the republics and regions must train cadres of Soviet and 
Party officials from among the members of the Party. 
d) To arrange non-Party conferences of workers and 
peasants at which People¹s Commissars, and responsible 
Party workers in general, should report on the most 
important measures taken by the Soviet Government. 
MEASURES TO RAISE THE CULTURAL 
LEVEL OF THE LOCAL POPULATION 
It is necessary, for example: 
a) to organise clubs (non-Party) and other educational 
institutions to be conducted in the local languages; 
b) to enlarge the network of educational institutions 
of all grades to be conducted in the local languages; 
c) to draw into school work the more or less loyal 
school-teachers of local origin; 
d) to create a network of societies for the dissemination 
of literacy in the local languages; 
e) to organise publishing activity.

FOURTH CONFERENCE 305 
ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION IN THE NATIONAL 
REPUBLICS AND REGIONS FROM THE STANDPOINT 
OF THE SPECIFIC NATIONAL FEATURES 
OF THEIR MANNER OF LIFE 
It is necessary, for example: 
a) to regulate and, where necessary, to stop the 
transference of populations; 
b) as far as possible to provide land for the local 
working population out of the state land fund; 
c) to make agricultural credit available to the local 
population; 
d) to expand irrigation work; 
e) to give the co-operatives, and especially the producers¹ 
co-operatives, all possible assistance (with 
a view to attracting handicraftsmen); 
f) to transfer factories and mills to republics in which 
suitable raw materials abound; 
g) to organise trade and technical schools for the 
local population; 
h) to organise agricultural courses for the local population. 
PRACTICAL MEASURES FOR THE ORGANISATION 
OF NATIONAL MILITARY UNITS 
It is necessary to proceed at once with the organisation 
of military schools in the republics and regions 
for the purpose of training within a certain time commanders 
from among the local people who could later 
serve as a core for the organisation of national military 
units. It goes without saying that a satisfactory 
Party and social composition of these national units,

J. V. S T A L I N 306 
particularly of the commanders, must be ensured. Where 
there are old military cadres among the local people 
(Tataria, and, partly, Bashkiria), it would be possible 
to organise regiments of national militia at once. Georgia, 
Armenia and Azerbaijan already have, I think, a division 
each. In the Ukraine and in Byelorussia it would be 
possible, at once, to form one division of militia in each 
(particularly in the Ukraine). 
The question of forming national military units is 
one of prime importance, both as regards defence against 
possible attacks by Turkey, Afghanistan, Poland, etc., 
and as regards the possibility of the Union of Republics 
being compelled to take action against neighbouring 
states. The importance of national military units from 
the standpoint of the internal situation in the Union of 
Republics needs no proof. It must be supposed that in 
this connection the numerical strength of our army will 
have to be increased by approximately 20-25 thousand 
men. 
THE ORGANISATION OF PARTY 
EDUCATIONAL WORK 
It is necessary, for example: 
a) to organise schools for elementary political education 
in the native languages; 
b) to create a Marxist literature in the native languages; 
c) to have a well-organised periodical press in the 
native languages; 
d) to widen the activities of the University of the 
Peoples of the East at the centre and in the localities 
and to provide this university with the necessary funds;

FOURTH CONFERENCE 307 
e) to organise a Party debating society at the University 
of the Peoples of the East, and to enlist the cooperation 
of members of the Central Committee living 
in Moscow; 
f) to intensify work in the Youth League and among 
women in the republics and regions. 
SELECTION OF PARTY AND SOVIET 
OFFICIALS WITH A VIEW TO IMPLEMENTING 
THE RESOLUTION ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
ADOPTED BY THE TWELFTH CONGRESS 
It is necessary to bring into the Registration and 
Distribution, Agitation and Propaganda, Organisation, 
Women¹s, and Instructors¹ Departments of the Central 
Committee, a definite number of people (two or 
three in each) from the nationalities to facilitate the 
Central Committee¹s current Party work in the border 
regions, and properly to distribute Party and Soviet 
officials among the republics and regions so as to 
ensure the implementation of the line on the national 
question adopted by the Twelfth Congress of the R.C.P.

2. RIGHTS AND ³LEFTS² 
IN THE NATIONAL REPUBLICS 
AND REGIONS 
Speech on the First Item of the Conference Agenda: 
³The Sultan-Galiyev Case² 
June 10 
I have taken the floor in order to make a few comments 
on the speeches of the comrades who have spoken 
here. As regards the principles involved in the Sultan- 
Galiyev case, I shall endeavour to deal with them in my 
report on the second item of the agenda. 
First of all, with regard to the conference itself. Someone 
(I have forgotten who exactly it was) said here 
that this conference is an unusual event. That is not so. 
Such conferences are not a novelty for our Party. The 
present conference is the fourth of its kind to be held 
since the establishment of Soviet power. Up to the beginning 
of 1919 three such conferences were held. Conditions 
at that time permitted us to call such conferences. 
But later, after 1919, in 1920 and 1921, when we were entirely 
taken up with the civil war, we had no time for conferences 
of this kind. And only now that we have finished 
with the civil war, now that we have gone deeply into the 
work of economic construction, now that Party work itself 
has become more concrete, especially in the national regions 
and republics, has it again become possible for us 
to call a conference of this kind. I think the Central Committee 
will repeatedly resort to this method in order to estab

FOURTH CONFERENCE 309 
lish full mutual understanding between those who are 
carrying out the policy in the localities and those who 
are making that policy. I think that such conferences 
should be called, not only from all the republics and regions, 
but also from individual regions and republics 
for the purpose of drawing up more concrete decisions. 
This alone can satisfy both the Central Committee and 
the responsible workers in the localities. 
I heard certain comrades say that I warned Sultan- 
Galiyev when I had the opportunity of acquainting 
myself with his first secret letter, addressed, I think, 
to Adigamov, who for some reason is silent and has not 
uttered a word here, although he should have been the 
first to speak and the one to have said most. I have been 
reproached by these comrades with having defended 
Sultan-Galiyev excessively. It is true that I defended 
him as long as it was possible, and I considered, and 
still consider, that it was my duty to do so. But I defended 
him only up to a certain point. And when Sultan- 
Galiyev went beyond that point I turned away from him. 
His first secret letter shows that he was already breaking 
with the Party, for the tone of his letter is almost whiteguard; 
he writes about members of the Central Committee 
as one can write only about enemies. I met him by 
chance in the Political Bureau, where he was defending 
the demands of the Tatar Republic in connection with 
the People¹s Commissariat of Agriculture. I warned him 
then, in a note I sent him, in which I called his secret 
letter an anti-Party one, and in which I accused him 
of creating an organisation of the Validov type; I told 
him that unless he desisted from illegal, anti-Party 
work he would come to a bad end, and any support from

J. V. S T A L I N 310 
me would be out of the question. He replied, in great 
embarrassment, that I had been misled; that he had 
indeed written to Adigamov, not, however, what was 
alleged, but something else; that he had always been a 
Party man and was so still, and he gave his word of 
honour that he would continue to be a Party man in future. 
Nevertheless, a week later he sent Adigamov a 
second secret letter, instructing him to establish contact 
with the Basmachi and with their leader Validov, and 
to ³burn² the letter. The whole thing, therefore, was 
vile, it was sheer deception, and it compelled me to break 
off all connection with Sultan-Galiyev. From that moment 
Sultan-Galiyev became for me a man beyond the 
pale of the Party, of the Soviets, and I considered it 
impossible to speak to him, although he tried several 
times to come to me and ³have a talk² with me. As far 
back as the beginning of 1919, the ³Left² comrades reproached 
me with supporting Sultan-Galiyev, with 
trying to save him for the Party, with wanting to spare 
him, in the hope that he would cease to be a nationalist 
and become a Marxist. I did, indeed, consider it my duty 
to support him for a time. There are so few intellectuals, 
so few thinking people, even so few literate people generally 
in the Eastern republics and regions, that one 
can count them on one¹s fingers. How can one help cherishing 
them? It would be criminal not to take all measures 
to save from corruption people of the East whom we 
need and to preserve them for the Party. But there is 
a limit to everything. And the limit in this case was 
reached when Sultan-Galiyev crossed over from the communist 
camp to the camp of the Basmachi. From that 
time on he ceased to exist for the Party. That is why he

FOURTH CONFERENCE 311 
found the Turkish ambassador more congenial than the 
Central Committee of our Party. 
I heard a similar reproach from Shamigulov, to the 
effect that, in spite of his insistence that we should finish 
with Validov at one stroke, I defended Validov 
and tried to preserve him for the Party. I did indeed 
defend Validov in the hope that he would reform. Worse 
people have reformed, as we know from the history of 
political parties. I decided that Shamigulov¹s solution 
of the problem was too simple. I did not follow his advice. 
It is true that a year later Shamigulov¹s forecast proved 
correct: Validov did not reform, he went over to the 
Basmachi. Nevertheless, the Party gained by the fact 
that we delayed Validov¹s desertion from the Party for a 
year. Had we settled with Validov in 1918, I am certain 
that comrades like Murtazin, Adigamov, Khalikov and 
others would not have remained in our ranks. (Voice: 
³Khalikov would have remained.²) Perhaps Khalikov 
would not have left us, but a whole group of comrades 
working in our ranks would have left with Validov. That 
is what we gained by our patience and foresight. 
I listened to Ryskulov, and I must say that his speech 
was not altogether sincere, it was semi-diplomatic (voice: 
³Quite true!²), and in general his speech made a bad 
impression. I expected more clarity and sincerity from 
him. Whatever Ryskulov may say, it is obvious that 
he has at home two secret letters from Sultan-Galiyev, 
which he has not shown to anyone, it is obvious that 
he was associated with Sultan-Galiyev ideologically. The 
fact that Ryskulov dissociates himself from the criminal 
aspect of the Sultan-Galiyev case, asserting that he is 
not involved with Sultan-Galiyev in the course leading

J. V. S T A L I N 312 
to Basmachism, is of no importance. That is not what 
we are concerned with at this conference. We are concerned 
with the intellectual, ideological ties with Sultan-
Galiyevism. That such ties did exist between Ryskulov 
and Sultan-Galiyev is obvious, comrades; Ryskulov 
himself cannot deny it. Is it not high time for him 
here, from this rostrum, at long last to dissociate himself 
from Sultan-Galiyevism emphatically and unreservedly? 
In this respect Ryskulov¹s speech was semidiplomatic 
and unsatisfactory. 
Enbayev also made a diplomatic and insincere speech. 
Is it not a fact that, after Sultan-Galiyev¹s arrest, Enbayev 
and a group of Tatar responsible workers, whom 
I consider splendid practical men in spite of their ideological 
instability, sent a demand to the Central Committee 
for his immediate release, fully vouching for him 
and hinting that the documents taken from Sultan- 
Galiyev were not genuine? Is that not a fact? But what 
did the investigation reveal? It revealed that all the 
documents were genuine. Their genuineness was admitted 
by Sultan-Galiyev himself, who, in fact, gave 
more information about his sins than is contained in 
the documents, who fully confessed his guilt, and, after 
confessing, repented. Is it not obvious that, after all this, 
Enbayev ought to have emphatically and unreservedly 
admitted his mistakes and to have dissociated himself 
from Sultan-Galiyev? But Enbayev did not do this. He 
found occasion to jeer at the ³Lefts,² but he would not 
emphatically, as a Communist should, dissociate himself 
from Sultan-Galiyevism, from the abyss into which 
Sultan-Galiyev had landed. Evidently he thought that 
diplomacy would save him.

FOURTH CONFERENCE 313 
Firdevs¹s speech was sheer diplomacy from beginning 
to end. Who the ideological leader was, whether Sultan- 
Galiyev led Firdevs, or whether Firdevs led Sultan- 
Galiyev, is a question I leave open, although I think 
that ideologically Firdevs led Sultan-Galiyev rather than 
the other way round. I see nothing particularly reprehensible 
in Sultan-Galiyev¹s exercises in theory. If Sultan-
Galiyev had confined himself to the ideology of Pan- 
Turkism and Pan-Islamism it would not have been so bad 
and I would say that this ideology, inspite of the ban pronounced 
by the resolution on the national question passed 
by the Tenth Party Congress, could be regarded as tolerable, 
and that we could confine ourselves to criticising it 
within the ranks of our Party. But when exercises in ideology 
end in establishing contacts with Basmach leaders, 
with Validov and others, it is utterly impossible to justify 
Basmach practices here on the ground that the ideology 
is innocent, as Firdevs tries to do. You can deceive nobody 
by such a justification of Sultan-Galiyev¹s activities. 
In that way it would be possible to find a justification 
for both imperialism and tsarism, for they too 
have their ideologies, which sometimes look innocent 
enough. One cannot reason in that way. You are not 
facing a tribunal, but a conference of responsible workers, 
who demand of you straightforwardness and sincerity, 
not diplomacy. 
Khojanov spoke well, in my opinion. And Ikramov 
did not speak badly either. But I must mention a passage 
in the speeches of these comrades which gives food for 
thought. Both said that there was no difference between 
present-day Turkestan and tsarist Turkestan, that only 
the signboard had been changed, that Turkestan had

J. V. S T A L I N 314 
remained what it was under the tsar. Comrades, if that 
was not a slip of the tongue, if it was a considered and 
deliberate statement, then it must be said that in that 
case the Basmachi are right and we are wrong. If Turkestan 
is in fact a colony, as it was under tsarism, then the 
Basmachi are right, and it is not we who should be trying 
Sultan-Galiyev, but Sultan-Galiyev who should be 
trying us for tolerating the existence of a colony in the 
framework of the Soviet regime. If that is true, I fail 
to understand why you yourselves have not gone over to 
Basmachism. Evidently, Khojanov and Ikramov uttered 
that passage in their speeches without thinking, for they 
cannot help knowing that present-day Soviet Turkestan 
is radically different from tsarist Turkestan. I wanted 
to point to that obscure passage in the speeches of these 
comrades in order that they should try to think this over 
and rectify their mistake. 
I take upon myself some of the charges Ikramov made 
against the work of the Central Committee, to the effect 
that we have not always been attentive and have not always 
succeeded in raising in time the practical questions 
dictated by conditions in the Eastern republics and regions. 
Of course, the Central Committee is overburdened 
with work and is unable to keep pace with events 
everywhere. It would be ridiculous to think that the 
Central Committee can keep pace with everything. Of 
course, there are few schools in Turkestan. The local 
languages have not yet become current in the state institutions, 
the institutions have not been made national 
in character. Culture in general is at a low level. All 
that is true. But can anybody seriously think that the 
Central Committee, or the Party as a whole, can raise

FOURTH CONFERENCE 315 
the cultural level of Turkestan in two or three years? We 
are all shouting and complaining that Russian culture, 
the culture of the Russian people, which is more cultured 
than the other peoples in the Union of Republics, 
is at a low level. Ilyich has repeatedly stated that we 
have little culture, that it is impossible to raise Russian 
culture appreciably in two or three, or even ten years. 
And if it is impossible to raise Russian culture appreciably 
in two or three, or even ten years, how can we demand 
a rapid rise of culture in the non-Russian backward regions 
with a low level of literacy? Is it not obvious that 
nine-tenths of the ³blame² falls on the conditions, on 
the backwardness, and that you cannot but take this 
into account? 
About the ³Lefts² and the Rights. 
Do they exist in the communist organisations in the 
regions and republics? Of course they do. That cannot 
be denied. 
Wherein lie the sins of the Rights? In the fact that 
the Rights are not and cannot be an antidote to, a reliable 
bulwark against, the nationalist tendencies which are 
developing and gaining strength in connection with the 
N.E.P. The fact that Sultan-Galiyevism did exist, that 
it created a certain circle of supporters in the Eastern 
republics, especially in Bashkiria and Tataria, leaves no 
doubt that the Right-wing elements, who in these republics 
comprise the overwhelming majority, are not a 
sufficiently strong bulwark against nationalism. 
I t should be borne in mind that our communist 
organisations in the border regions, in the republics and 
regions, can develop and stand firmly on their feet, can 
become genuine internationalist, Marxist cadres, only

J. V. S T A L I N 316 
if they overcome nationalism. Nationalism is the chief 
ideological obstacle to the training of Marxist cadres, 
of a Marxist vanguard, in the border regions and republics. 
The history of our Party shows that the Bolshevik 
Party, its Russian section, grew and gained strength 
in the fight against Menshevism; for Menshevism is the 
ideology of the bourgeoisie, Menshevism is a channel 
through which bourgeois ideology penetrates into our 
Party, and had the Party not overcome Menshevism 
it could not have stood firmly on its feet. Ilyich wrote 
about this a number of times. Only to the degree that 
it overcame Menshevism in its organisational and ideological 
forms did Bolshevism grow and gain strength as 
a real leading party. The same must be said of nationalism 
in relation to our communist organisations in the 
border regions and republics. Nationalism is playing 
the same role in relation to these organisations as Menshevism 
in the past played in relation to the Bolshevik 
Party. Only under cover of nationalism can various kinds 
of bourgeois, including Menshevik, influences penetrate 
our organisations in the border regions. Our organisations 
in the republics can become Marxist only if they 
are able to resist the nationalist ideas which are forcing 
their way into our Party in the border regions, and are 
forcing their way because the bourgeoisie is reviving, 
the N.E.P. is spreading, nationalism is growing, there 
are survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism, which also 
give an impetus to local nationalism, and there is the 
influence of foreign states, which support nationalism 
in every way. If our communist organisations in the 
national republics want to gain strength as genuinely 
Marxist organisations they must pass through the stage

FOURTH CONFERENCE 317 
of fighting this enemy in the republics and regions. 
There is no other way. And in this fight the Rights are 
weak. Weak because they are infected with scepticism 
with regard to the Party and easily yield to the influence 
of nationalism. Herein lies the sin of the Right wing of 
the communist organisations in the republics and regions. 
But no less, if not more, sinful are the ³Lefts² in 
the border regions. If the communist organisations in 
the border regions cannot grow strong and develop into 
genuinely Marxist cadres unless they overcome nationalism, 
these cadres themselves will be able to become 
mass organisations, to rally the majority of the working 
people around themselves, only if they learn to be flexible 
enough to draw into our state institutions all the 
national elements that are at all loyal, by making concessions 
to them, and if they learn to manoeuvre between 
a resolute fight against nationalism in the Party and an 
equally resolute fight to draw into Soviet work all the 
more or less loyal elements among the local people, the 
intelligentsia, and so on. The ³Lefts² in the border 
regions are more or less free from the sceptical attitude 
towards the Party, from the tendency to yield to the influence 
of nationalism. But the sins of the ³Lefts² lie 
in the fact that they are incapable of flexibility in relation 
to the bourgeois-democratic and the simply loyal 
elements of the population, they are unable and unwilling 
to manoeuvre in order to attract these elements, 
they distort the Party¹s line of winning over the majority 
of the toiling population of the country. But this 
flexibility and ability to manoeuvre between the fight 
against nationalism and the drawing of all the elements 
that are at all loyal into our state institutions must be

J. V. S T A L I N 318 
created and developed at all costs. It can be created and 
developed only if we take into account the entire complexity 
and the specific nature of the situation encountered 
in our regions and republics; if we do not simply engage in 
transplanting the models that are being created in the 
central industrial districts, which cannot be transplanted 
mechanically to the border regions; if we do not brush 
aside the nationalist-minded elements of the population, 
the nationalist-minded petty bourgeois; and if we learn to 
draw these elements into the general work of state administration. 
The sin of the ³Lefts² is that they are infected 
with sectarianism and fail to understand the paramount 
importance of the Party¹s complex tasks in the national 
republics and regions. 
While the Rights create the danger that by their 
tendency to yield to nationalism they may hinder the 
growth of our communist cadres in the border regions, 
the ³Lefts² create the danger for the Party that by their 
infatuation with an over-simplified and hasty ³communism² 
they may isolate our Party from the peasantry 
and from broad strata of the local population. 
Which of these dangers is the more formidable? If 
the comrades who are deviating towards the ³Left² intend 
to continue practising in the localities their policy 
of artificially splitting the population‹and this policy 
has been practised not only in Chechnya and in the Yakut 
Region, and not only in Turkestan . . . . (Ibrahimov: 
³They are tactics of differentiation.²) Ibrahimov has 
now thought of substituting the tactics of differentiation 
for the tactics of splitting, but that changes nothing. 
If, I say, they intend to continue practising their policy 
of splitting the population from above; if they think

FOURTH CONFERENCE 319 
that Russian models can be mechanically transplanted 
to a specifically national milieu regardless of the manner 
of life of the inhabitants and of the concrete conditions; 
if they think that in fighting nationalism everything 
that is national must be thrown overboard; in short, 
if the ³Left² Communists in the border regions intend 
to remain incorrigible, I must say that of the two, the 
³Left² danger may prove to be the more formidable. 
This is all I wanted to say about the ³Lefts² and 
the Rights. I have run ahead somewhat, but that is because 
the whole conference has run ahead and has anticipated 
the discussion of the second item. 
We must chastise the Rights in order to make them 
fight nationalism, to teach them to do so in order to 
forge real communist cadres from among local people. 
But we must also chastise the ³Lefts² in order to teach 
them to be flexible and to manoeuvre skilfully, so as to 
win over the broad masses of the population. All this 
must be done because, as Khojanov rightly remarked, 
the truth lies ³in between² the Rights and the ³Lefts.²

3. PRACTICAL MEASURES 
FOR IMPLEMENTING THE RESOLUTION 
ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION 
ADOPTED BY THE TWELFTH 
PARTY CONGRESS 
Report on the Second Item of the Agenda 
June 10 
Comrades, you have no doubt already received the 
draft platform* of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee on the national question. (Voices: ³Not 
everybody has it.²) This platform concerns the second 
item of the agenda with all the sub-items. At all events, 
everybody has received the conference agenda in the 
shape of the Central Committee¹s coded telegram. 
The Political Bureau¹s proposals may be divided into 
three groups. 
The first group of questions concerns the reinforcement 
of the communist cadres in the republics and 
regions from among local people. 
The second group of questions concerns everything 
connected with the implementation of the concrete decisions 
on the national question adopted by the Twelfth 
Congress, namely: questions about drawing working people 
of the local population into Party and Soviet affairs; 
questions about measures necessary for raising 
the cultural level of the local population; questions 
about improving the economic situation in the repub- 
* See this volume, pp. 299-308.‹Ed.

FOURTH CONFERENCE 321 
lics and regions with due regard to specific features 
of the manner of life; and lastly, questions about the 
co-operatives in the regions and republics, the transfer 
of factories, the creation of industrial centres, and so on. 
This group of questions concerns the economic, cultural 
and political tasks of the regions and republics, with 
due regard to local conditions. 
The third group of questions concerns the Constitution 
of the Union of Republics in general, and in particular 
the question of amending this Constitution with 
a view to setting up a second chamber of the Central 
Executive Committee of the Union of Republics. As you 
know, this last group of questions is connected with the 
forthcoming session of the Central Executive Committee 
of the Union of Republics. 
I pass to the first group of questions‹those concerning 
the methods of training and reinforcing Marxist 
cadres from among local people, who will be capable 
of serving as the most important and, in the long run, 
as the decisive bulwark of Soviet power in the border 
regions. If we examine the development of our Party 
(I refer to its Russian section, as the main section) and 
trace the principal stages in its development, and then, 
by analogy, draw a picture of the development of our 
communist organisations in the regions and republics 
in the immediate future, I think we shall find the key 
to the understanding of the specific features in these 
countries which distinguish the development of our 
Party in the border regions. 
The principal task in the first period of our Party¹s 
development, the development of its Russian section, 
was to create cadres, Marxist cadres. These Marxist

J. V. S T A L I N 322 
cadres were made, forged, in our fight with Menshevism. 
The task of these cadres then, at that period‹I am 
referring to the period from the foundation of the Bolshevik 
Party to the expulsion from the Party of the 
Liquidators, as the most pronounced representatives 
of Menshevism‹the main task was to win over to the 
Bolsheviks the most active, honest and outstanding 
members of the working class, to create cadres, to form 
a vanguard. The struggle here was waged primarily 
against tendencies of a bourgeois character‹especially 
against Menshevism‹which prevented the cadres from 
being combined into a single unit, as the main core of 
the Party. At that time it was not yet the task of the 
Party, as an immediate and vital need, to establish 
wide connections with the vast masses of the working 
class and the toiling peasantry, to win over those masses, 
to win a majority in the country. The Party had not 
yet got so far. 
Only in the next stage of our Party¹s development, 
only in its second stage, when these cadres had grown, 
when they had taken shape as the basic core of our Party, 
when the sympathies of the best elements among the 
working class had already been won, or almost won‹ 
only then was the Party confronted with the task, as 
an immediate and urgent need, of winning over the vast 
masses, of transforming the Party cadres into a real 
mass workers¹ party. During this period the core of our 
Party had to wage a struggle not so much against Menshevism 
as against the ³Left² elements within our Party, 
the ³Otzovists² of all kinds, who were attempting to 
substitute revolutionary phraseology for a serious study 
of the specific features of the new situation which arose

FOURTH CONFERENCE 323 
after 1905, who by their over-simplified ³revolutionary² 
tactics were hindering the conversion of our Party cadres 
into a genuine mass party, and who by their activities 
were creating the danger of the Party becoming divorced 
from the broad masses of the workers. It scarcely needs 
proof that without a resolute struggle against this ³Left² 
danger, without defeating it, the Party could not have 
won over the vast labouring masses. 
Such, approximately, is the picture of the fight on 
two fronts, against the Rights, i.e., the Mensheviks, 
and against the ³Lefts²; the picture of the development 
of the principal section of our Party, the Russian section. 
Comrade Lenin quite convincingly depicted this 
essential, inevitable development of the Communist 
Parties in his pamphlet ³Left-Wing² Communism, an 
Infantile Disorder. There he showed that the Communist 
Parties in the West must pass, and are already 
passing, through approximately the same stages of development. 
We, on our part, shall add that the same 
must be said of the development of our communist organisations 
and Communist Parties in the border regions. 
It should, however, be noted that, despite the analogy 
between what the Party experienced in the past and 
what our Party organisations in the border regions are 
experiencing now, there are, after all, certain important 
specific features in our Party¹s development in the national 
republics and regions, features which we must 
without fail take into account, for if we do not take 
them carefully into account we shall run the risk of 
committing a number of very gross errors in determining 
the tasks of training Marxist cadres from among local 
people in the border regions.

J. V. S T A L I N 324 
Let us pass to an examination of these specific features. 
The fight against the Right and ³Left² elements in 
our organisations in the border regions is necessary and 
obligatory, for otherwise we shall not be able to train 
Marxist cadres closely connected with the masses. That 
is clear. But the specific feature of the situation in the 
border regions, the feature that distinguishes it from our 
Party¹s development in the past, is that in the border 
regions the forging of cadres and their conversion into 
a mass party are taking place not under a bourgeois 
system, as was the case in the history of our Party, but 
under the Soviet system, under the dictatorship of the 
proletariat. At that time, under the bourgeois system, 
it was possible and necessary, because of the conditions 
of those times, to beat first of all the Mensheviks (in 
order to forge Marxist cadres) and then the Otzovists 
(in order to transform those cadres into a mass party); 
the fight against those two deviations filled two 
entire periods of our Party¹s history. Now, under present 
conditions, we cannot possibly do that, for the Party 
is now in power, and being in power, the Party needs 
in the border regions reliable Marxist cadres from among 
local people who are connected with the broad masses 
of the population. Now we cannot first of all defeat the 
Right danger with the help of the ³Lefts,² as was the 
case in the history of our Party, and then the ³Left² 
danger with the help of the Rights. Now we have to wage 
a fight on both fronts simultaneously, striving to defeat 
both dangers so as to obtain as a result in the border regions 
trained Marxist cadres of local people connected 
with the masses. At that time we could speak of cadres

FOURTH CONFERENCE 325 
who were not yet connected with the broad masses, but 
who were to become connected with them in the next 
period of development. Now it is ridiculous even to speak 
of that, because under the Soviet regime it is impossible 
to conceive of Marxist cadres not being connected with 
the broad masses in one way or another. They would be 
cadres who would have nothing in common either with 
Marxism or with a mass party. All this considerably 
complicates matters and dictates to our Party organisations 
in the border regions the need for waging a simultaneous 
struggle against the Rights and the ³Lefts.² 
Hence the stand our Party takes that it is necessary to 
wage a fight on two fronts, against both deviations 
simultaneously. 
Further, it should be noted that the development 
of our communist organisations in the border regions 
is not proceeding in isolation, as was the case in our 
Party¹s history in relation to its Russian section, but 
under the direct influence of the main core of our Party, 
which is experienced not only in forming Marxist cadres, 
but also in linking those cadres with the broad masses 
of the population and in revolutionary manoeuvring 
in the fight for Soviet power. The specific feature of the 
situation in the border regions in this respect is that our 
Party organisations in these countries, owing to the 
conditions under which Soviet power is developing 
there, can and must manoeuvre their forces for the purpose 
of strengthening their connections with the broad 
masses of the population, utilising for this purpose the 
rich experience of our Party during the preceding period. 
Until recently, the Central Committee of the R.C.P. 
usually carried out manoeuvring in the border regions

J. V. S T A L I N 326 
directly, over the heads of the communist organisations 
there, sometimes even by-passing those organisations, 
drawing all the more or less loyal national elements into 
the general work of Soviet construction. Now this work 
must be done by the organisations in the border regions 
themselves. They can do it, and must do it, bearing in 
mind that that is the best way of converting the Marxist 
cadres from among local people into a genuine mass party 
capable of leading the majority of the population 
of the country. 
Such are the two specific features which must be taken 
strictly into account when determining our Party¹s line 
in the border regions in the matter of training Marxist 
cadres, and of these cadres winning over the broad masses 
of the population. 
I pass to the second group of questions. Since not all 
the comrades have received the draft platform, I will 
read it and explain. 
First, ³measures for drawing the proletarian and 
semi-proletarian elements into Party and Soviet affairs.² 
Why is this needed? It is needed to bring the 
Party, and particularly the Soviet, apparatus closer to 
the population. These apparatuses must function in 
the languages that are understood by the broad masses 
of the people, otherwise it will be impossible to bring 
them closer to the population. Our Party¹s task is to 
make Soviet power near and dear to the masses, but this 
task can be fulfilled only by making this power understood 
by the masses. Those who are at the head of the 
state institutions, and the institutions themselves, must 
function in the language understood by the people. The 
chauvinistic elements who are destroying the feeling of

FOURTH CONFERENCE 327 
friendship and solidarity between the peoples in the 
Union of Republics must be expelled from these institutions; 
our institutions, both in Moscow and in the republics, 
must be purged of such elements, and local 
people who know the language and customs of the population 
must be placed at the head of the state institutions 
in the republics. 
I remember that two years ago, the Chairman of the 
Council of People¹s Commissars in the Kirghiz Republic 
was Pestkovsky, who could not speak the Kirghiz 
language. Already at that time this circumstance gave 
rise to enormous difficulties in the matter of strengthening 
the ties between the Government of the Kirghiz 
Republic and the masses of the Kirghiz peasants. That 
is precisely why the Party arranged for a Kirghiz to 
be Chairman of the Council of People¹s Commissars of 
the Kirghiz Republic. 
I also remember that last year a group of comrades 
from Bashkiria proposed that a Russian comrade be put 
forward as Chairman of the Council of People¹s Commissars 
of Bashkiria. The Party emphatically rejected 
this proposal and secured the nomination of a Bashkir 
for this post. 
The task is to pursue this line, and, in general, the 
line of gradually making the governmental institutions 
national in character in all the national republics and 
regions, and first of all in such an important republic as 
the Ukraine. 
Secondly, ³to choose and enlist the more or less loyal 
elements among the local intelligentsia, while at the 
same time training Soviet cadres from among the members 
of the Party.² This proposition does not call for

J. V. S T A L I N 328 
special explanation. Now that the working class is in 
power and has rallied the majority of the population 
around itself, there are no grounds for fearing to draw 
the more or less loyal elements, even including former 
³Octobrists,² into the work of Soviet construction. On 
the contrary, all these elements must without fail be 
drawn into the work in the national regions and republics 
in order to assimilate and Sovietise them in the course 
of the work itself. 
Thirdly, ³to arrange non-Party conferences of workers 
and peasants at which members of the Government 
should report on the measures taken by the Soviet Government.² 
I know that many People¹s Commissars in the 
republics, in the Kirghiz Republic, for example, are 
unwilling to visit the districts, to attend meetings of 
peasants, to speak at meetings and inform the broad 
masses about what the Party and the Soviet Government 
are doing in connection with questions that are particularly 
important to the peasants. We must put a stop 
to this state of affairs. Non-Party conferences of workers 
and peasants must be convened without fail, and at them 
the masses must be informed about the Soviet Government¹s 
activities. Unless this is done we cannot even 
dream of bringing the state apparatus closer to the people. 
Further, ³measures to raise the cultural level of the 
local population.² Several measures are proposed, but, 
of course, the list cannot be regarded as exhaustive. 
These measures are: a) ³to organise clubs (non-Party) 
and other educational institutions to be conducted in 
the local languages²; b) ³to enlarge the network of educational 
institutions of all grades to be conducted in 
the local languages ³; c) ³to enlist the services of the more

FOURTH CONFERENCE 329 
or less loyal school-teachers²; d) ³to create a network of 
societies for the dissemination of literacy in the local 
languages²; e) ³to organise publishing activity.² All 
these measures are clear and intelligible and, therefore, 
do not need special explanation. 
Further, ³economic construction in the national 
republics and regions from the standpoint of the specific 
national features of their manner of life.² The relevant 
measures proposed by the Political Bureau are: a) ³to 
regulate and, where necessary, to stop the transference 
of populations²; b) ³to provide land for the local working 
population out of the state land fund²; c) ³to make 
agricultural credit available to the local population²; 
d) ³to expand irrigation work²; e) ³to transfer factories 
and mills to republics in which raw materials abound²; 
f) ³to organise trade and technical schools²; g) ³to organise 
agricultural courses,² and lastly, h) ³to give the 
co-operatives, and especially the producers¹ co-operatives, 
all possible assistance (with a view to attracting 
handicraftsmen).² 
I must dwell on the last point owing to its special 
importance. In the past, under the tsar, development 
proceeded in such a way that the kulaks grew, agricultural 
capital developed, the bulk of the middle peasants 
were in a state of unstable equilibrium, while the broad 
masses of the peasants, the broad masses of small peasant 
proprietors, writhed in the clutches of ruin and poverty. 
Now, however, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, 
when credit, the land and power are in the hands of the 
working class, development cannot proceed along the 
old lines, notwithstanding the conditions of the N.E.P., 
notwithstanding the revival of private capital. Those

J. V. S T A L I N 330 
comrades are absolutely wrong who assert that in view of 
the development of the N.E.P. we must again go through 
the old history of developing kulaks at the cost of wholesale 
ruin for the majority of the peasants. That path 
is not our path. Under the new conditions, when the 
proletariat is in power and holds in its hands all the 
basic threads of our economy, development must proceed 
along a different path, along the path of uniting the small 
proprietors of the villages in all kinds of co-operative 
societies, which will be backed by the state in their struggle 
against private capital; along the path of gradually 
drawing the millions of small peasant proprietors into 
socialist construction through the co-operatives; along 
the path of gradually improving the economic conditions 
of the small peasant proprietors (and not of impoverishing 
them). In this respect, ³all possible assistance 
to the co-operatives² in the border regions, in these 
predominantly agricultural countries, is of prime importance 
for the future economic development of the 
Union of Republics. 
Further, ³practical measures for the organisation of 
national military units.² I think that we have delayed 
considerably in drawing up measures of this kind. It is 
our duty to organise national military units. Of course, 
they cannot be organised in a day; but we can, and must, 
proceed at once to set up military schools in the republics 
and regions for the purpose of training within a certain 
period, from among local people, commanders who could 
later serve as a core for the organisation of national mili 
tary units. It is absolutely necessary to start this and to 
push it forward. If we had reliable national military 
units with reliable commanders in republics like Tur

FOURTH CONFERENCE 331 
kestan, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Georgia, Armenia 
and Azerbaijan, our republic would be in a far better 
position than it is now both in regard to defence and 
in regard to the contingency of our having to take 
action. We must start this work at once. Of course, this 
will involve an increase in the strength of our army by 
20-25 thousand men, but this cannot be regarded as an 
insuperable obstacle. 
I shall not dwell at length on the remaining points 
(see the draft platform), for their significance is selfevident 
and needs no explanation. 
The third group of questions consists of those connected 
with the institution of a second chamber of the 
Central Executive Committee of the Union and the 
organisation of the People¹s Commissariats of the Union 
of Republics. Here the principal questions, the most 
conspicuous ones, are singled out and, of course, the 
list of such questions cannot be regarded as complete. 
The Political Bureau conceives the second chamber 
as a component part of the Central Executive Committee 
of the U.S.S.R. Proposals were made that, in addition 
to the existing Central Executive Committee, there should 
be set up a Supreme Soviet of Nationalities separate 
from the Central Executive Committee. This project was 
rejected and the Political Bureau decided that it was 
more advisable to divide the Central Executive Committee 
itself into two chambers: the first, which can be called 
the Union Soviet, to be elected by the Congress of Soviets 
of the Union of Republics, and the second, which should 
be called the Soviet of Nationalities, to be elected by the 
Central Executive Committees of the republics and by the 
regional congresses of national regions in the proportion

cadres were made, forged, in our fight with Menshevism. 
The task of these cadres then, at that period‹I am 
referring to the period from the foundation of the Bolshevik 
Party to the expulsion from the Party of the 
Liquidators, as the most pronounced representatives 
of Menshevism‹the main task was to win over to the 
Bolsheviks the most active, honest and outstanding 
members of the working class, to create cadres, to form 
a vanguard. The struggle here was waged primarily 
against tendencies of a bourgeois character‹especially 
against Menshevism‹which prevented the cadres from 
being combined into a single unit, as the main core of 
the Party. At that time it was not yet the task of the 
Party, as an immediate and vital need, to establish 
wide connections with the vast masses of the working 
class and the toiling peasantry, to win over those masses, 
to win a majority in the country. The Party had not 
yet got so far. 
Only in the next stage of our Party¹s development, 
only in its second stage, when these cadres had grown, 
when they had taken shape as the basic core of our Party, 
when the sympathies of the best elements among the 
working class had already been won, or almost won‹ 
only then was the Party confronted with the task, as 
an immediate and urgent need, of winning over the vast 
masses, of transforming the Party cadres into a real 
mass workers¹ party. During this period the core of our 
Party had to wage a struggle not so much against Menshevism 
as against the ³Left² elements within our Party, 
the ³Otzovists² of all kinds, who were attempting to 
substitute revolutionary phraseology for a serious study 
of the specific features of the new situation which arose

FOURTH CONFERENCE 333 
Council of People ¹s Commissars of the Union of Republics, 
while the other five Commissariats are directive 
bodies, i.e., the Supreme Council of National Economy, 
the People¹s Commissariat of Food, the People¹s Commissariat 
of Finance, the People¹s Commissariat of 
Labour, and the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection 
are subordinate to two authorities, while the remaining 
six Commissariats are independent. This project was criticised 
by some of the Ukrainians, Rakovsky, Skrypnik, 
and others. The Political Bureau, however, rejected the 
proposal of the Ukrainians that the People¹s Commissariat 
of Foreign Affairs and the People¹s Commissariat 
of Foreign Trade be transferred from the category of 
merged Commissariats to the directive category and, in 
the main, accepted the principal clauses of the Constitution 
in keeping with the decisions adopted last year. 
Such, in general, are the considerations that guided 
the Political Bureau in drawing up the draft platform. 
I think that on the question of the Constitution of the 
Union of Republics and of the second chamber, the conference 
will have to limit itself to a brief exchange of 
opinions, the more so that this question is being studied by 
a commission of the Plenum of the Central Committee.77 
The question of the practical measures to implement the 
resolutions of the Twelfth Congress will, in my opinion, 
have to be discussed in greater detail. As for the question 
of strengthening the local Marxist cadres, we shall have 
to devote the greater part of the debate to this matter. 
I think that it would be advisable before opening the 
debate to hear the reports of the comrades from the republics 
and regions on the basis of the information they 
have brought from their localities.

4. REPLY TO THE DISCUSSION 
June 12 
First of all I would like to say a few words about 
the reports made by the comrades, and about the character 
of the conference in general, in the light of the reports 
presented. Although this is the fourth conference 
of this kind held since Soviet power came into existence, 
it is the only one that can be called a full conference, 
having heard more or less full and substantiated 
reports from the republics and regions. It is evident 
from the reports that the communist cadres in the regions 
and republics have grown more mature and are learning 
to work independently. I think that the wealth of information 
the comrades have given us, the experience of 
the work performed in the regions and republics which 
the comrades related to us here, should certainly be 
brought to the knowledge of the whole of our Party in the 
shape of the minutes of this conference. The people have 
grown more mature and are making progress, they are 
learning to govern‹such is the first conclusion to be 
drawn from the reports, the first impression that one 
gets from them. 
Passing to the contents of the reports, we can divide 
the material presented into two groups: reports from 
the Socialist Republics, and reports from the People¹s, 
non-Socialist, Republics (Bukhara, Khorezm).

FOURTH CONFERENCE 335 
Let us proceed to examine the first group of reports. 
It is evident from these reports that as regards bringing 
the Party and, particularly, the state apparatus closer 
to the language and manner of life of the people, Georgia 
must be considered the most developed and advanced 
republic. Next to Georgia comes Armenia. The other 
republics and regions are behind them. Such, to my mind, 
is the indisputable conclusion. This is due to the fact 
that Georgia and Armenia are more highly cultured than 
the others. The percentage of literates in Georgia is 
fairly high‹as much as 80; in Armenia it is not less 
than 40. That is the secret why these two countries are 
ahead of the other republics. From this it follows that the 
more literate and cultured a country, a republic, or a 
region is, the closer is the Party and Soviet apparatus 
to the people, to its language, to its manner of life. All 
this, provided other conditions are equal, of course. 
This is obvious, and there is nothing new in this conclusion; 
and precisely because there is nothing new in it, 
this conclusion is often forgotten and, not infrequently, 
efforts are made to attribute cultural backwardness, and 
hence, backwardness in state affairs, to ³mistakes² in 
the Party¹s policy, to conflicts, and so forth, whereas 
the basis of all this is insufficient literacy, lack of culture. 
If you want to make your country an advanced 
country, that is, to raise the level of its statehood, then 
increase the literacy of the population, raise the culture 
of your country, the rest will come. 
Approaching the matter from that angle, and appraising 
the situation in the individual republics in the light 
of these reports, it must be admitted that the situation 
in Turkestan, the present state of affairs there, is

J. V. S T A L I N 336 
the most unsatisfactory, and is the most alarming. Cultural 
backwardness, a terribly low percentage of literacy, 
divorce of the state apparatus from the language and 
manner of life of the peoples of Turkestan, a terribly 
slow tempo of development‹such is the picture. And 
yet it is obvious that, of all the Soviet republics, Turkestan 
is the most important from the standpoint of 
revolutionising the East; and not only because Turkestan 
presents a combination of nationalities most closely connected 
with the East, but also because, owing to its 
geographical situation, it cuts right into the heart of 
the East, which is the most exploited, and which has 
accumulated in its midst the most explosive material 
for the fight against imperialism. That is why presentday 
Turkestan is the weakest point of Soviet power. 
The task is to transform Turkestan into a model republic, 
into an outpost for revolutionising the East. That is 
precisely why it is necessary to concentrate attention 
on Turkestan with a view to raising the cultural level of 
the masses, to making the state apparatus national in 
character, and so forth. We must carry out this task at all 
costs, sparing no effort, and shrinking from no sacrifice. 
The second weak point of Soviet power is the Ukraine. 
The state of affairs there as regards culture, literacy, 
etc., is the same, or almost the same, as in Turkestan. 
The state apparatus is as remote from the language and 
manner of life of the people as it is in Turkestan. And 
yet the Ukraine has the same significance for the peoples 
of the West as Turkestan has for the peoples of the East. 
The situation in the Ukraine is still more complicated 
by certain specific features of the country¹s industrial 
development. The point is that the basic industries,

FOURTH CONFERENCE 337 
coal and metallurgy, appeared in the Ukraine not from 
below, not as a result of the natural development of her 
national economy, but from above; they were introduced, 
artificially implanted, from outside. Consequently 
the proletariat in those industries is not of local origin, 
its language is not Ukrainian. The result of this is that 
the exercise of cultural influence by the towns upon the 
countryside and the establishment of the bond between 
the proletariat and the peasantry are considerably hindered 
by these differences in the national composition 
of the proletariat and the peasantry. All these circumstances 
must be taken into account in the work of transforming 
the Ukraine into a model republic. And in view 
of her enormous significance for the peoples of the West, 
it is absolutely essential to transform her into a model 
republic. 
I pass to the reports on Khorezm and Bukhara. 
I shall not speak about Khorezm because of the absence 
of the Khorezm representative; it would be unfair to 
criticise the work of the Khorezm Communist Party and 
of the Government of Khorezm merely on the basis of 
the information at the disposal of the Central Committee. 
What Broido said here about Khorezm concerns the past. 
It has little relation to the present situation in Khorezm. 
Concerning the Party there, he said that fifty per cent 
of the members are merchants and the like. Perhaps 
that was the case in the past, but at the present time the 
Party is being purged; not a single ³uniform Party card² 
has yet been issued to Khorezm; properly speaking, 
there is no Party there, it will be possible to speak of a 
Party only when the purge is completed. It is said that 
there are several thousand members of the Party there.

J. V. S T A L I N 338 
I think that after the purge not more than some hundreds 
of Party members will be left. The situation was exactly 
the same in Bukhara last year, when 16,000 members 
were registered in the Party there; after the purge not 
more than a thousand were left. 
I pass to the report on Bukhara. Speaking of Bukhara, 
I must first of all say a word or two about the general 
tone and character of the reports presented. I consider 
that, on the whole, the reports on the republics and regions 
were truthful and, on the whole, did not diverge 
from reality. Only one report diverged very widely from 
reality, that was the report on Bukhara. It was not even 
a report, it was sheer diplomacy, for everything that is 
bad in Bukhara was obscured, glossed over, whereas everything 
that glitters on the surface and strikes the eye 
was pushed into the foreground, for display. Conclusion‹
all¹s well in Bukhara. I think that we have gathered 
at this conference not for the purpose of playing at 
diplomacy with one another, of making eyes at one an 
other, while surreptitiously trying to lead one another 
by the nose, but for the purpose of telling the whole 
truth, of revealing, exposing all the evils in the communist 
way, and of devising means for improvement. Only 
in this way can we make progress. In this respect, the 
report on Bukhara differs from the other reports by its 
untruthfulness. It was not by chance that I asked the 
reporter here about the composition of the Council of 
Nazirs in Bukhara. The Council of Nazirs is the Council 
of People¹s Commissars. Are there any dekhans, i.e., 
peasants, on it? The reporter did not answer. But I have 
information about this; it turns out that there is not a 
single peasant in the Bukhara Government. The nine, or

FOURTH CONFERENCE 339 
eleven, members of the government include the son of 
a rich merchant, a trader, an intellectual, a mullah, a 
trader, an intellectual, another trader, but not a single 
dekhan. And yet, as is well known, Bukhara is exclusively 
a peasant country. 
This question is directly related to the question of 
the Bukhara Government¹s policy. What is the policy 
of this government that is headed by Communists? Does 
it serve the interests of the peasantry, of its own peasantry? 
I would like to mention only two facts which illustrate 
the policy of the Bukhara Government that is 
headed by Communists. From a document signed by 
highly responsible comrades and old members of the 
Party it is evident, for example, that of the credits the 
State Bank of Bukhara has granted since it came in existence, 
75 per cent have gone to private merchants, whereas 
the peasant co-operatives have received 2 per cent. 
In absolute figures it works out like this: 7,000,000 
gold rubles to the merchants, and 220,000 gold rubles 
to the peasants. Further, in Bukhara the land has not 
been confiscated. But the Emir¹s cattle were confiscated 
. . . for the benefit of the peasants. But what do we 
find? From this same document it appears that about 
2,000 head of cattle were confiscated for the benefit of 
the peasants, but of this number the peasants received 
only about 200; the rest were sold, to wealthy citizens 
of course. 
And this government calls itself a Soviet, a People¹s, 
government! It scarcely needs proof that in the activities 
of the Bukhara Government just described 
there is nothing either of a People¹s or of a Soviet 
character.

J. V. S T A L I N 340 
The reporter painted a very radiant picture of the 
attitude of the Bukhara people towards the R.S.F.S.R. 
and the Union of Republics. According to what he said, 
all is well in this respect too. The Bukhara Republic, 
i t appears, wants to join the Union. Evidently the 
reporter thinks that it is enough to want to enter the 
Union of Republics for the gates to be flung open. No, 
comrades, the matter is not so simple. You have to ask 
first whether you will be allowed to enter the Union 
of Republics. To be able to join the Union you must 
first show the peoples of the Union that you have 
earned the right to join; you have to win this right. 
I must remind the Bukhara comrades that the Union 
of Republics must not be regarded as a dumping 
ground. 
Lastly, to conclude the first part of my reply to the 
discussion on the reports, I should like to touch upon 
a characteristic feature of them. Not one of the reporters 
answered the question that is on the agenda of this 
conference, namely: whether there are unused, unengaged 
reserves of local people. Nobody answered this question, 
nobody even touched upon it, except Grinko, who, however, 
is not a reporter. And yet this question is of firstrate 
importance. Are there in the republics, or in the 
regions, local responsible workers who are free, who are 
not being used? If there are, why are they not being 
used? If there are no such reserves, and yet a shortage of 
workers is experienced, with what national elements are 
the vacant places in the Party or Soviet apparatuses being 
filled? All these questions are of the highest importance 
for the Party. I know that in the republics and regions 
there are some leading workers, mostly Russians, who

FOURTH CONFERENCE 341 
sometimes block the way for local people, hinder their 
promotion to certain posts, push them into the background. 
Such cases happen, and this is one of the causes of discontent 
in the republics and regions. But the greatest 
and basic cause of discontent is that there are terribly 
few unengaged reserves of local people fit for the work; 
most likely there are none at all. That is the whole point. 
Since there is a shortage of local workers, it is obviously 
necessary to engage non-local workers for the work, 
people of other nationalities, for time will not wait; 
we must build and govern, and cadres of local people 
grow slowly. I think that here the workers from the 
regions and republics showed a certain guile in saying 
nothing about this. And yet it is obvious that nine-tenths 
of the misunderstandings are due to the shortage of responsible 
workers from among local people. Only one 
conclusion can be drawn from this: the Party must 
be set the urgent task of accelerating the formation of 
cadres of Soviet and Party workers from among local 
people. 
From the reports I pass to the speeches. I must observe, 
comrades, that not one of the speakers criticised 
the statement of principles in the draft platform submitted 
by the Political Bureau. (Voice: ³It is above criticism.²) 
I take this as evidence of the conference¹s agreement, 
of the conference¹s solidarity with the principles 
that are formulated in this part of the platform. 
(Voices: ³Quite true!²) 
Trotsky¹s addendum, which he spoke about, or insertion 
(it concerns the part dealing with principles), 
ought to be adopted, for it in no way alters the character 
of that part of the resolution; more than that, it naturally

J. V. S T A L I N 342 
follows from it. The more so because, in essence, Trotsky¹s 
addendum is a repetition of the well-known point 
in the resolution on the national question adopted by 
the Tenth Congress, where it is said that Petrograd and 
Moscow models must not be mechanically transplanted 
to the regions and republics. It is, of course, a repetition, 
but I think that sometimes it does no harm to repeat 
certain things. In view of this, I do not intend to 
dwell at length on that part of the resolution which deals 
with principles. Skrypnik¹s speech gives some ground 
for the conclusion that he interprets that part in his 
own way, and in face of the main task‹to combat 
Great-Russian chauvinism, which is the chief danger‹ 
he tries to obscure the other danger, the danger of local 
nationalism. But such an interpretation is profoundly 
mistaken. 
The second part of the Political Bureau¹s platform 
concerns the questions of the character of the Union of 
Republics, and of certain amendments to the Constitution 
of the Union of Republics from the standpoint of 
instituting a so-called second chamber. I must say that 
on this point the Political Bureau disagrees somewhat 
with the Ukrainian comrades. What is formulated in 
the Political Bureau¹s draft platform, the Political Bureau 
adopted unanimously. But some points are disputed 
by Rakovsky. This, incidentally, was apparent in the 
Commission of the Plenum of the Central Committee. 
Perhaps we ought not to discuss this, because this question 
is not to be settled here. I have already reported 
on this part of the platform; I said that this question 
was being studied by the Commission of the Plenum of 
the Central Committee and by the Commission of the

FOURTH CONFERENCE 343 
Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the 
Union.78 But since the question has been raised I cannot 
ignore it. 
It is wrong to say that the question of confederation 
or federation is a trivial one. Was it accidental that, 
when examining the well-known draft Constitution adopted 
at the Congress of the Union of Republics, the Ukrainian 
comrades deleted from it the phrase which said 
that the republics ³are uniting into a single union state²? 
Was that accidental? Did they not do that? Why did they 
delete that phrase? Was it accidental that the Ukrainian 
comrades proposed in their counter-draft that the People¹s 
Commissariat of Foreign Trade and the People¹s 
Commissariat of Foreign Affairs should not be merged 
but be transferred to the directive category? What becomes 
of the single union state if each republic retains 
its own People¹s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs and 
People¹s Commissariat of Foreign Trade? Was it accidental 
that in their counter-draft the Ukrainians reduced 
the power of the Presidium of the Central Executive 
Committee to nil by splitting it up between two presidiums 
of the two chambers? All these amendments of Rakovsky¹s 
were registered and examined by the Commission 
of the Plenum of the Central Committee, and rejected. 
Why, then, repeat them here? I regard this persistence 
on the part of some of the Ukrainian comrades as evidence 
of a desire to obtain in the definition of the character 
of the Union something midway between a confederation 
and a federation, with a leaning towards confederation. 
It is obvious, however, that we are creating not 
a confederation, but a federation of republics, a single 
union state, uniting military, foreign, foreign trade and

J. V. S T A L I N 344 
other affairs, a state which in no way diminishes the 
sovereignty of the individual republics. 
If the Union is to have a People¹s Commissariat of 
Foreign Affairs, a People¹s Commissariat of Foreign 
Trade, and so forth, and the republics constituting the 
Union are also to have all these Commissariats, it is obvious 
that it will be impossible for the Union as a whole 
to come before the outside world as a single state. One 
thing or the other: either we merge these apparatuses and 
face the external enemy as a single Union, or we do not 
merge them and create not a union state, but a conglomeration 
of republics, in which case every republic must 
have its own parallel apparatus. I think that in this 
matter truth is on the side of Comrade Manuilsky, and 
not on the side of Rakovsky and Skrypnik. 
From questions of state I pass to questions of a purely 
concrete, practical character, connected partly with 
the Political Bureau¹s practical proposals, and partly 
with the amendments that may be moved here by the 
comrades who are engaged in practical work. Being the 
reporter on behalf of the Political Bureau, I did not, 
and could not, say that the list of concrete, practical 
proposals made by the Political Bureau is exhaustive. 
On the contrary, I said at the very outset that there may 
be omissions in the list, and that additions were inevitable. 
Skrypnik is proposing one such addition in relation 
to the trade unions. That one is acceptable. I also 
accept some of the additions proposed by Comrade Mikoyan. 
As regards a fund for publishing work, and for the 
press in general in some of the backward republics and 
regions, an amendment is certainly needed. That question 
was overlooked. So also was the question of schools in

FOURTH CONFERENCE 345 
some regions, and even republics. Primary schools are 
not included in the State Budget. This is certainly an 
omission, and there may be a heap of such omissions. 
I therefore suggest to the comrades engaged in practical 
work, who spoke a lot about the state of their organisations, 
but made less effort to propose something concrete, 
to think about this and to submit their concrete addenda, 
amendments, etc., to the Central Committee, which will 
unify them, insert them in the relevant points and circulate 
them to the organisations. 
I cannot pass over in silence a proposal made by 
Grinko to the effect that certain easier conditions should 
be created to facilitate local people among the less cultured 
and, perhaps, less proletarian nationalities entering 
the Party and being promoted to its leading bodies. 
The proposal is correct and, in my opinion, it ought to 
be adopted. 
I conclude my reply to the discussion with the following 
motion: that the Political Bureau¹s draft platform 
on the national question be adopted as a basis, 
Trotsky¹s amendment to be taken into consideration. 
That the Central Committee be requested to classify 
amendments of a practical character that have been, or 
may be, proposed, and to embody them in the relevant 
points of the platform; that the Central Committee be 
requested to have the draft platform, the minutes, the 
resolution and the most important documents left by 
the reporters printed in a week¹s time and distributed 
to the organisations. That the draft platform be adopted 
without setting up a special commission. 
I have not touched on the question of setting up a 
commission on the national question under the Central

J. V. S T A L I N 346 
Committee. Comrades, I have some doubt about the advisability 
of creating such an organisation, firstly because 
the republics and regions will certainly not provide 
top-level workers for this body. I am sure of that. Secondly, 
I think that the Regional Committees and national 
Central Committees will not agree to yield to the 
Central Committee¹s commission even a particle of their 
rights in the distribution of responsible workers. At the 
present time, when distributing forces, we usually consult 
the Regional Committees and national Central 
Committees. If this commission is set up, the centre of 
gravity will naturally shift to it. There is no analogy 
between a commission on the national question and 
commissions on questions concerning the co-operatives, 
or work among the peasants. Commissions on work in 
the countryside, and on co-operatives, usually draw up 
general instructions. On the national question, however, 
we need not general instructions, but the indication of 
concrete steps to be taken in each republic and region, 
and this a general commission will be unable to do. It 
is doubtful whether any commission can draw up and 
adopt any decisions for, let us say, the Ukrainian Republic: 
two or three men from the Ukraine cannot act as 
substitutes for the Central Committee of the C.P.(B.) 
of the Ukraine. That is why I think that a commission 
will not produce any effective results. The step 
that is here proposed‹to appoint people from the 
nationalities to the chief departments of the Central 
Committee‹is to my mind quite sufficient for the time 
being. If no particular success is achieved within the 
next six months, the question can then be raised of setting 
up a special commission.

5. REPLY TO SPEECHES 
June 12 
Since I have been attacked (laughter), permit me to 
answer the point about the ³one and indivisible.² None 
other than Stalin, in the resolution on the national question, 
denounced the ³one and indivisible² in Point 8. 
Obviously, what was meant was not ³indivisible,² but 
federation, whereas the Ukrainians are trying to force 
confederation upon us. That is the first question. 
The second question is about Rakovsky. I repeat, 
for I have already said it once, that the Constitution 
that was adopted at the First Congress of Soviets of the 
U.S.S.R. says that such and such republics ³are uniting 
into a single union state²‹³the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics.² The Ukrainians sent their counter-draft 
to the Central Committee. That draft says: such and such 
republics ³are forming a Union of Socialist Republics.² 
The words ³are uniting into a single union state² were 
thrown out. Six words were thrown out. Why? Was that 
accidental? What has become of federation? I also perceive 
the germ of confederalism in Rakovsky¹s action in 
throwing out of the clause in the Constitution that was 
adopted at the First Congress, the words describing the 
Presidium as being ³vested with supreme authority in 
the intervals between sessions,² and in dividing power

J. V. S T A L I N 348 
between the presidiums of two chambers, i.e., reducing 
the Union power to a fiction. Why did he do that? Because 
he is opposed to the idea of a union state, opposed 
to real Union power. That is the second question. 
The third: in the draft proposed by the Ukrainians, 
the People¹s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs and the 
People¹s Commissariat of Foreign Trade are not merged, 
but are transferred from the merged category to the directive 
category. 
Such are the three reasons which cause me to perceive 
the germ of confederation in Rakovsky¹s proposals. Why 
is there such a divergence between your proposals and 
the text of the Constitution, which the Ukrainian delegation 
also accepted? (Rakovsky: ³We¹ve had the Twelfth 
Congress.²) 
Excuse me. The Twelfth Congress rejected your amendments 
and adopted the wording: ³uniting the republics 
into a single union state.² 
I can see that during the period from the First Congress 
of the Union of Republics to the Twelfth Party Congress 
and the present Conference, some of the Ukrainian 
comrades have undergone a certain evolution from federalism 
to confederalism. Well, I am in favour of federation, 
i.e., opposed to confederation, i.e., opposed to the

THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 
AND THE QUESTION 
OF THE MIDDLE STRATA 
The question of the middle strata is undoubtedly one 
of the basic questions of the workers¹ revolution. The 
middle strata are the peasantry and the small urban working 
people. The oppressed nationalities, nine-tenths of 
whom consist of middle strata, should also be put in 
this category. As you see, these are the strata whose economic 
status puts them midway between the proletariat 
and the capitalist class. The relative importance of these 
strata is determined by two circumstances: firstly, these 
strata constitute the majority, or, at any rate, a large 
minority of the population of the existing states; secondly, 
they constitute the important reserves from which 
the capitalist class recruits its army against the proletariat. 
The proletariat cannot retain power unless it enjoys 
the sympathy and support of the middle strata, primarily 
of the peasantry, especially in a country like our Union 
of Republics. The proletariat cannot even seriously 
contemplate seizing power if these strata have not been 
at least neutralised, if they have not yet managed to 
break away from the capitalist class, and if the bulk 
of them still serve as the army of capital. Hence the

J. V. S T A L I N 350 
fight for the middle strata, the fight for the peasantry, 
which was a conspicuous feature of the whole of our revolution 
from 1905 to 1917, a fight which is still far from 
ended, and which will continue to be waged in the 
future. 
One of the reasons for the defeat of the 1848 Revolution 
in France was that it failed to evoke a sympathetic 
response among the French peasantry. One of the reasons 
for the fall of the Paris Commune was that it encountered 
the opposition of the middle strata, especially of the 
peasantry. The same must be said of the Russian revolution 
of 1905. 
Basing themselves on the experience of the European 
revolutions, certain vulgar Marxists, headed by Kautsky, 
came to the conclusion that the middle strata, especially 
the peasantry, are almost the born enemies of the workers¹ 
revolution, that, therefore, we must reckon with a lengthier 
period of development, as a result of which the proletariat 
will become the majority of the nation and the proper 
conditions for the victory of the workers¹ revolution 
will thereby be created. On the basis of that conclusion, 
they, these vulgar Marxists, warned the proletariat against 
³premature² revolution. On the basis of that conclusion, 
they, from ³motives of principle,² left the middle strata 
entirely at the disposal of capital. On the basis of that 
conclusion, they prophesied the doom of the Russian October 
Revolution, on the grounds that the proletariat in 
Russia constituted a minority, that Russia was a peasant 
country, and, therefore, a victorious workers¹ revolution 
in Russia was impossible. 
It is noteworthy that Marx himself had an entirely 
different appraisal of the middle strata, especially of

OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE QUESTION OF MIDDLE STRATA 351 
the peasantry. Whereas the vulgar Marxists, washing 
their hands of the peasantry and leaving it entirely at 
the political disposal of capital, noisily bragged about 
their ³firm principles,² Marx, the most true to principle 
of all Marxists, persistently advised the Communist 
Party not to lose sight of the peasantry, to win i t 
over to the side of the proletariat and to make sure 
of its support in the future proletarian revolution. 
We know that in the Œfifties, after the defeat of the 
February Revolution in France and in Germany, Marx 
wrote to Engels, and through him to the Communist 
Party of Germany: 
³The whole thing in Germany will depend on the possibility 
of backing the proletarian revolution by some second edition of 
the Peasant War.²79 
That was written about the Germany of the Œfifties, 
a peasant country, where the proletariat comprised a 
small minority, where the proletariat was less organised 
than the proletariat was in Russia in 1917, and where 
the peasantry, owing to its position, was less disposed 
to support a proletarian revolution than the peasantry 
in Russia in 1917. 
The October Revolution undoubtedly represented 
that happy combination of a ³peasant war² and a ³proletarian 
revolution² of which Marx wrote, despite all 
the ³highly principled² chatterboxes. The October Revolution 
proved that such a combination is possible and 
can be brought about. The October Revolution proved 
that the proletariat can seize power and retain it, if it 
succeeds in wresting the middle strata, primarily the 
peasantry, from the capitalist class, if it succeeds in

J. V. S T A L I N 352 
converting these strata from reserves of capital into reserves 
of the proletariat. 
In brief: the October Revolution was the first of all 
the revolutions in the world to bring into the forefront 
the question of the middle strata, and primarily of the 
peasantry, and the first to solve it successfully, despite 
all the ³theories² and lamentations of the heroes of the 
Second International. 
That is the first merit of the October Revolution, if 
one may speak of merit in such a connection. 
But the matter did not stop there. The October Revolution 
went further and tried to rally the oppressed nationalities 
around the proletariat. We have already said 
above that nine-tenths of the populations of these nationalities 
consist of peasants and of small urban working 
people. That, however, does not exhaust the concept 
³oppressed nationality.² Oppressed nationalities are 
usually oppressed not only as peasants and as urban 
working people, but also as nationalities, i.e., as the 
toilers of a definite nationality, language, culture, manner 
of life, habits and customs. The double oppression 
cannot help revolutionising the labouring masses of the 
oppressed nationalities, cannot help impelling them to 
fight the principal force of oppression‹capital. This 
circumstance formed the basis on which the proletariat 
succeeded in combining the ³proletarian revolution² 
not only with a ³peasant war,² but also with a ³national 
war.² All this could not fail to extend the field of action 
of the proletarian revolution far beyond the borders of 
Russia; it could not fail to jeopardise the deepest reserves 
of capital. Whereas the fight for the middle strata 
of a given dominant nationality is a fight for the imme

OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE QUESTION OF MIDDLE STRATA 353 
diate reserves of capital, the fight for the emancipation 
of the oppressed nationalities could not help becoming 
a fight to win particular reserves of capital, the deepest of 
them, a fight to liberate the colonial and unequal peoples 
from the yoke of capital. This latter fight is still far 
from ended. More than that, it has not yet achieved 
even the first decisive successes. But this fight for the 
deep reserves was started by the October Revolution, 
and it will undoubtedly expand, step by step, with the 
further development of imperialism, with the growth 
of the might of our Union of Republics, and with the 
development of the proletarian revolution in the 
West. 
In brief: the October Revolution actually initiated 
the fight of the proletariat for the deep reserves of capital 
in the shape of the masses of the people in the oppressed 
and unequal countries; it was the first to raise 
the banner of the struggle to win these reserves. That is 
its second merit. 
In our country the peasantry was won over under 
the banner of socialism. The peasantry received land 
at the hands of the proletariat, defeated the landlords 
with the aid of the proletariat and rose to power 
under the leadership of the proletariat; consequently, it 
could not but feel, could not but realise, that the 
process of its emancipation was proceeding, and would 
continue, under the banner of the proletariat, under its 
red banner. This could not but convert the banner of 
socialism, which was formerly a bogey to the peasantry, 
into a banner which won its attention and aided 
its emancipation from subjection, poverty and oppression.

J. V. S T A L I N 354 
The same is true, but to an even greater degree, of 
the oppressed nationalities. The battle-cry for the emancipation 
of the nationalities, backed by such facts as 
the liberation of Finland, the withdrawal of troops from 
Persia and China, the formation of the Union of Republics, 
the moral support openly given to the peoples of 
Turkey, China, Hindustan and Egypt‹this battle-cry 
was first sounded by the people who were the victors 
in the October Revolution. The fact that Russia, which 
was formerly regarded by the oppressed nationalities as 
a symbol of oppression, has now, after it has become 
socialist, been transformed into a symbol of emancipation, 
cannot be called an accident. Nor is it an accident that 
the name of the leader of the October Revolution, Comrade 
Lenin, is now the most beloved name pronounced 
by the downtrodden, oppressed peasants and revolutionary 
intelligentsia of the colonial and unequal countries. 
In the past, the oppressed and downtrodden slaves of 
the vast Roman Empire regarded Christianity as a rock 
of salvation. We are now reaching the point where socialism 
may serve (and is already beginning to serve!) as 
the banner of liberation for the millions who inhabit 
the vast colonial states of imperialism. It can hardly 
be doubted that this circumstance has greatly facilitated 
the task of combating prejudices against socialism, 
and has cleared the way for the penetration of socialist 
ideas into the most remote corners of the oppressed countries. 
Formerly it was difficult for a Socialist to come 
out openly among the non-proletarian, middle strata of 
the oppressed or oppressor countries; but today he can 
come forward openly and advocate socialist ideas among 
these strata and expect to be listened to, and even heeded,

OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND THE QUESTION OF MIDDLE STRATA 355 
for he i s backed by so cogent an argument as the 
October Revolution. That, too, is a result of the October 
Revolution. 
In brief: the October Revolution cleared the way 
for socialist ideas among the middle, non-proletarian, 
peasant strata of all nationalities and races; it made the 
banner of socialism popular among them. That is the 
third merit of the October Revolution.

THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST 
CONGRESS OF WORKING WOMEN AND 
PEASANT WOMEN80 
Five years ago, the Central Committee of our Party 
convened in Moscow the First All-Russian Congress of 
Working Women and Peasant Women. Over a thousand 
delegates, representing not less than a million women 
toilers, gathered at the congress. That congress 
was a landmark in our Party¹s work among women 
toilers. The inestimable merit of that congress was that 
it laid the foundation for organising political enlightenment 
of the working women and peasant women in our 
Republic. 
Some people might think that there is nothing exceptional 
about that, that the Party has always engaged in 
the political enlightenment of the masses, including women, 
that the political enlightenment of women cannot 
be of great importance, seeing that we have united 
cadres consisting of workers and peasants. That opinion 
is radically wrong. Now that power has passed 
into the hands of the workers and peasants, the political 
enlightenment of women toilers is of paramount 
importance.

THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY 357 
And for the following reasons. 
Our country has a population of about 140,000,000; 
of these, no less than half are women, mainly working 
women and peasant women, who are downtrodden, unenlightened 
and ignorant. Since our country has earnestly 
set to work to build the new, Soviet life, is it not obvious 
that the women, who constitute half its population, 
will be like a weight on its feet every time a step forward 
is taken if they remain downtrodden, unenlightened and 
ignorant? 
The working woman stands side by side with the 
working man. Together with him she is carrying out the 
common task of building our industry. She can be of assistance 
in this common task if she is politically conscious, 
if she is politically enlightened. But she may wreck 
the common task if she is downtrodden and ignorant, 
wreck it not maliciously, of course, but because of her 
ignorance. 
The peasant woman stands side by side with the 
peasant. Together with him she is carrying out the common 
task of developing our agriculture, of making 
it prosperous, of making it flourish. She can be 
of tremendous assistance in this matter if she rids herself 
of her ignorance. On the other hand, she may 
hinder the whole matter if she remains the captive of 
ignorance. 
Working women and peasant women are free citizens, 
equal with working men and peasants. They take part in 
the election of our Soviets and co-operatives, and they 
can be elected to these bodies. The working women and 
peasant women can improve our Soviets and co-operatives, 
strengthen and develop them, if they are politically

J. V. S T A L I N 358 
enlightened. But they can weaken and undermine them 
if they are ignorant. 
Lastly, the working women and peasant women are 
mothers; they are rearing our youth‹the future of our 
country. They can either warp a child¹s soul or rear for 
us a younger generation that will be of healthy mind and 
capable of promoting our country¹s progress, depending 
upon whether the mothers sympathise with the Soviet 
system or whether they follow in the wake of the 
priests, the kulaks, the bourgeoisie. 
That is why the political enlightenment of working 
women and peasant women is now, when the workers 
and peasants have set to work to build the new life, a 
matter of paramount importance for the achievement 
of real victory over the bourgeoisie. 
That is why the significance of the First Congress 
of Working Women and Peasant Women, which initiated 
the work of political enlightenment among women 
toilers, is really inestimable. 
Five years ago, at the First Congress of Working 
Women and Peasant Women, the Party¹s immediate 
task was to draw hundreds of thousands of working women 
into the common task of building the new, Soviet 
life; and in the front ranks stood the working women in 
the industrial districts, for they were the most active 
and politically conscious elements among the women 
toilers. It must be admitted that no little has been done 
in this respect during the past five years, although much 
still remains to be done. 
The Party¹s immediate task now is to draw the millions 
of peasant women into the common task of building 
our Soviet life. The work of the past five years has

THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY 359 
already resulted in the promotion of a number of leaders 
from the ranks of the peasant women. Let us hope that 
the ranks of the peasant women leaders will be reinforced 
with additional enlightened peasant women. Let us 
hope that the Party will successfully cope with this task 
too.

SPEECH AT A CELEBRATION MEETING 
AT THE MILITARY ACADEMY 
November 17, 1923 
(Brief Newspaper Report) 
At the celebration of the fourth anniversary of our 
Red Cavalry, a speech was delivered by the founder of 
the Cavalry Army and its honorary Red Army man, 
Comrade Stalin. 
Comrade Stalin emphasised that at the time when 
the basic nucleus of the cavalry, the embryo of the future 
Cavalry Army, was being organised, its initiators came 
into conflict with the opinion of leading military circles 
and military experts who denied the necessity of organising 
any cavalry at all. 
The most characteristic page of the history of the 
Cavalry Army was written in the summer of 1919, when 
our cavalry became a combination of masses of cavalry 
with masses of machine guns. The celebrated ³tachanka²* 
is the symbol of that combination. 
However numerous our cavalry may be, if in its 
operations it is unable to combine the power of the horse 
with the power of machine guns and artillery, it will 
cease to be a formidable force. 
The most glorious page in the history of the Cavalry 
Army was written at the close of 1919, when twelve regi- 
* A light horse-drawn cart on which a machine gun was 
mounted.‹Tr.

SPEECH AT A CELEBRATION MEETING AT THE MILITARY ACADEMY 361 
ments of our cavalry routed some twenty-two enemy regiments 
at the approaches to Voronezh. That event marked 
the actual conversion of our Cavalry Corps into a Cavalry 
Army. 
The characteristic feature of that period was that 
at that stage our cavalry acquired still another quality 
which enabled it to achieve victory over Denikin¹s cavalry, 
namely: it attached to itself several infantry units, 
which it usually transported in carts, and employed as a 
screen against the enemy, so as to be able to take a short 
rest under cover of this screen, recuperate its strength, 
and then strike another blow at the enemy. That was the 
combination of cavalry with infantry‹the latter being 
an auxiliary force. This combination, this additional 
new quality, transformed our cavalry into a formidable 
mobile force, which struck terror in the enemy. 
In conclusion, Comrade Stalin said: ³Comrades, I am 
not the kind of man to go into raptures, but I must say 
that if our Cavalry Army retains these new qualities, 
our cavalry and its leader, Comrade Budyonny, will be 
invincible.²

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 
Report Delivered at an Enlarged Meeting of the Krasnaya 
Presnya District Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) 
With Group Organisers, Members of the Debating Society 
and of the Bureau of the Party Units 
December 2, 1923 
Comrades, first of all I must say that I am delivering 
a report here in my personal capacity and not in the name 
of the Central Committee of the Party. If the meeting 
is willing to hear such a report, I am at your service. 
(Voices: ³Yes.²) This does not mean that I disagree with 
the Central Committee in any way on this question; not 
at all. I am speaking here in my personal capacity only 
because the commission of the Central Committee for 
drafting measures to improve the internal situation in 
the Party81 is to present its findings to the Central Committee 
in a day or two; these findings have not yet been 
presented, and therefore I have as yet no formal right to 
speak in the name of the Central Committee, although I 
am sure that what I am about to say to you will, in the 
main, express the Central Committee¹s position on these 
questions. 
DISCUSSION‹A SIGN 
OF THE PARTY¹S STRENGTH 
The first question I would like to raise here is that of 
the significance of the discussion that is now taking 
place in the press and in the Party units. What does 
this discussion show? What does it indicate? Is it a

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 363 
storm that has burst into the calm life of the Party? Is 
this discussion a sign of the Party¹s disintegration, 
its decay, as some say, or of its degeneration, as 
others say? 
I think, comrades, that it is neither one nor the other: 
there is neither degeneration nor disintegration. The 
fact of the matter is that the Party has grown more mature 
during the past period; it has adequately rid itself 
of useless ballast; it has become more proletarian. You 
know that two years ago we had not less than 700,000 
members; you know that several thousand members 
have dropped out, or have been kicked out, of the Party. 
Further, the Party membership has improved, its quality 
has risen in this period as a result of the improvement 
in the conditions of the working class due to the revival 
of industry, as a result of the return of the old skilled 
workers from the countryside, and as a result of the new 
wave of cultural development that is spreading among 
the industrial workers. 
In short, owing to all these circumstances, the Party 
has grown more mature, its quality has risen, its needs 
have grown, it has become more exacting, it wants to 
know more than it has known up to now, and it wants 
to decide more than it has up to now. 
The discussion which has opened is not a sign of the 
Party¹s weakness, still less is it a sign of its disintegration 
or degeneration; it is a sign of strength, a sign of 
firmness, a sign of the improvement in the quality of 
the Party¹s membership, a sign of its increased activity.

J. V. S T A L I N 364 
CAUSES OF THE DISCUSSION 
The second question that confronts us is: what has 
caused the question of internal Party policy to become 
so acute precisely in the present period, in the autumn 
of this year? How is this to be explained? What were 
the causes? I think, comrades, that there were two 
causes. 
The first cause was the wave of discontent and strikes 
over wages that swept through certain districts of the 
republic in August of this year. The fact of the matter 
is that this strike wave exposed the defects in our organisations; 
it revealed the isolation of our organisations‹ 
both Party and trade-union‹from the events taking place 
in the factories. And in connection with this strike 
wave the existence was discovered within our Party of 
several secret organisations of an essentially anti-communist 
nature, which strove to disintegrate the Party. 
All these defects revealed by the strike wave were exposed 
to the Party so glaringly, and with such a sobering 
effect, that i t felt the necessity for internal Party 
changes. 
The second cause of the acuteness of the question 
of internal Party policy precisely at the present moment 
was the wholesale release of Party comrades to go on 
vacation. It is natural, of course, for comrades to go on 
vacation, but this assumed such a mass character, that 
Party activity became considerably weaker precisely 
at the time when the discontent arose in the factories, 
and that greatly helped to expose the accumulated defects 
just at this period, in the autumn of this year.

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 365 
DEFECTS IN INTERNAL PARTY LIFE 
I have mentioned defects in our Party life that were 
exposed in the autumn of this year, and which brought 
up the question of improving internal Party life. What 
are these defects in internal Party life? Is it that the 
Party line was wrong, as some comrades think; or that, 
although the Party¹s line was correct, in practice it departed 
from the right road, was distorted because of 
certain subjective and objective conditions? 
I think that the chief defect in our internal Party 
life is that, although the Party¹s line, as expressed in 
the decisions of our congresses, is correct, in the localities 
(not everywhere, of course, but in certain districts) 
it was put into practice in an incorrect way. While the 
proletarian-democratic line of our Party was correct, the 
way it was put into practice in the localities resulted in 
cases of bureaucratic distortion of this line. 
That is the chief defect. The existence of contradictions 
between the basic Party line as laid down by the 
Congresses (Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth), and the way 
our organisations put this line into practice in the localities‹
that is the foundation of all the defects in internal 
Party life. 
The Party line says that the major questions of our 
Party activities, except, of course, those that brook no 
delay, or those that are military or diplomatic secrets, 
must without fail be discussed at Party meetings. That 
i s what the Party line says. But in Party practice 
in the localities, not everywhere, of course, it was considered 
that there is really no great need for a number 
of questions concerning internal Party practice to be

J. V. S T A L I N 366 
discussed at Party meetings since the Central Committee 
and the other leading organisations will decide these 
questions. 
The Party line says that our Party officials must 
without fail be elected unless there are insuperable obstacles 
to this, such as absence of the necessary Party 
standing, and so forth. You know that, according to the 
Party rules, secretaries of Gubernia Committees must 
have a pre-October Party standing, secretaries of Uyezd 
Committees must have at least three years¹, and units 
secretaries a year¹s, Party standing. In Party practice, 
however, it was often considered that since a certain 
Party standing was needed, no real elections were 
needed. 
The Party line says that the Party membership must 
be kept informed about the work of the economic organisations, 
the factories and trusts, for, naturally, our Party 
units are morally responsible to the non-Party masses 
for the defects in the factories. Nevertheless, in Party 
practice it was considered that since there is a Central 
Committee which issues directives to the economic organisations, 
and since these economic organisations are 
bound by those directives, the latter will be carried out 
without control from below by the mass of the Party 
membership. 
The Party line says that responsible workers in different 
branches of work, whether Party, economic, tradeunion, 
or military workers, notwithstanding their specialisation 
in their own particular work, are interconnected, 
constitute inseparable parts of one whole, for they 
are all working in the common cause of the proletariat, 
which cannot be torn into parts. In Party practice, how

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 367 
ever, it was considered that since there is specialisation, 
division of labour according to properly Party activity 
and economic, military, etc., activity, the Party officials 
are not responsible for those working in the economic 
sphere, the latter are not responsible for the Party officials, 
and, in general, that the weakening and even 
loss of connection between them are inevitable. 
Such, comrades, are, in general, the contradictions 
between the Party line, as registered in a number of decisions 
of our Congresses, from the Tenth to the Twelfth, 
and Party practice. 
I am far from blaming the local organisations for 
this distortion of the Party line, for, when you come to 
examine it, this is not so much the fault as the misfortune 
of our local organisations. The nature of this misfortune, 
and how things could have taken this turn, I 
shall tell you later on, but I wanted to register this 
fact in order to reveal this contradiction to you and 
then try to propose measures for improvement. 
I am also far from considering our Central Committee 
to be blameless. It, too, has sinned, as has every 
institution and organisation; i t , too, shares part of 
the blame and part of the misfortune: blame, at least, 
for not, whatever the reason, exposing these defects 
in time, and for not taking measures to eliminate 
them. 
But that is not the point now. The point now is to 
ascertain the causes of the defects I have just spoken 
about. Indeed, how did these defects arise, and how can 
they be removed?

J. V. S T A L I N 368 
THE CAUSES OF THE DEFECTS 
The first cause is that our Party organisations have 
not yet rid themselves, or have still not altogether rid 
themselves, of certain survivals of the war period, a 
period that has passed, but has left in the minds of our 
responsible workers vestiges of the military regime in 
the Party. I think that these survivals find expression 
in the view that our Party is not an independently acting 
organism, not an independently acting, militant organisation 
of the proletariat, but something in the nature of 
a system of institutions, something in the nature of a 
complex of institutions in which there are officials 
of lower rank and officials of higher rank. That, 
comrades, is a profoundly mistaken view that has nothing 
in common with Marxism; that view is a survival 
that we have inherited from the war period, when we 
militarised the Party, when the question of the independent 
activity of the mass of the Party membership had 
necessarily to be shifted into the background and military 
orders were of decisive importance. I do not remember 
that this view was ever definitely expressed; nevertheless, 
it, or elements of it, still influences our work. Comrades, 
we must combat such views with all our might, 
for they are a very real danger and create favourable conditions 
for the distortion in practice of the essentially 
correct line of our Party. 
The second cause is that our state apparatus, which 
is bureaucratic to a considerable degree, exerts a certain 
amount of pressure on the Party and the Party workers. 
In 1917, when we were forging ahead, towards October, 
we imagined that we would have a Commune, a free

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 369 
association of working people, that we would put an end 
to bureaucracy in government institutions, and that it 
would be possible, if not in the immediate period, then 
within two or three short periods, to transform the state 
into a free association of working people. Practice has 
shown, however, that this is still an ideal which is a 
long way off, that to rid the state of the elements of bureaucracy, 
to transform Soviet society into a free association 
of working people, the people must have a high 
level of culture, peace conditions must be fully guaranteed 
all around us so as to remove the necessity of maintaining 
a large standing army, which entails heavy expenditure 
and cumbersome administrative departments, 
the very existence of which leaves its impress upon all 
the other state institutions. Our state apparatus is bureaucratic 
to a considerable degree, and it will remain 
so for a long time to come. Our Party comrades work 
in this apparatus, and the situation‹I might say the 
atmosphere‹in this bureaucratic apparatus is such that 
it helps to bureaucratise our Party workers and our Party 
organisations. 
The third cause of the defects, comrades, is that 
some of our units are not sufficiently active, they are 
backward, and in some cases, particularly in the border 
regions, they are even wholly illiterate. In these districts, 
the units display little activity and are politically and 
culturally backward. That circumstance, too, undoubtedly 
creates a favourable soil for the distortion of the 
Party line. 
The fourth cause is the absence of a sufficient number 
of trained Party comrades in the localities. Recently, 
in the Central Committee, I heard the report of a

J. V. S T A L I N 370 
representative of one of the Ukrainian organisations. The 
reporter was a very capable comrade who shows great promise. 
He said that of 130 units, 80 have secretaries who 
were appointed by the Gubernia Committee. In answer 
to the remark that this organisation was acting wrongly 
in this respect, the comrade pleaded that there were no 
literate people in the units, that they consisted of new 
members, that the units themselves ask for secretaries 
to be sent them, and so forth. I may grant that half of 
what this comrade said was an overstatement, that the 
matter is not only that there are no trained people in the 
units, but also that the Gubernia Committee was overzealous 
and followed the old tradition. But even if the 
Gubernia Committee was correct only to the extent of fifty 
per cent, is it not obvious that if there are such units in the 
Ukraine, how many more like them must there be in the 
border regions, where the organisations are young, where 
there are fewer Party cadres and less literacy than in 
the Ukraine? That is also one of the factors that create 
favourable conditions for the distortion in practice of 
the essentially correct Party line. 
Lastly, the fifth cause‹insufficient information. 
We sent out too little information, and this applies primarily 
to the Central Committee, possibly because it is 
overburdened with work. We receive too little information 
from the localities. This must cease. This is also 
a serious cause of the defects that have accumulated 
within the Party.

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 371 
HOW SHOULD THE DEFECTS 
IN INTERNAL PARTY LIFE 
BE REMOVED? 
What measures must be adopted to remove these defects? 
The first thing is tirelessly, by every means, to combat 
the survivals and habits of the war period in our 
Party, to combat the erroneous view that our Party is a 
system of institutions, and not a militant organisation 
of the proletariat, which is intellectually vigorous, acts 
independently, lives a full life, is destroying the old and 
creating the new. 
Secondly, the activity of the mass of the Party membership 
must be increased; all questions of interest to 
the membership in so far as they can be openly discussed 
must be submitted to it for open discussion, and 
the possibility ensured of free criticism of all proposals 
made by the different Party bodies. Only in this way will 
it be possible to convert Party discipline into really conscious, 
really iron discipline; only in this way will it be 
possible to increase the political, economic and cultural 
experience of the mass of Party members; only in this 
way will it be possible to create the conditions necessary 
to enable the Party membership, step by step, to 
promote new active workers, new leaders, from its ranks. 
Thirdly, the principle of election must be applied 
in practice to all Party bodies and official posts, if there 
are no insuperable obstacles to this such as lack of the 
necessary Party standing, and so forth. We must eliminate 
the practice of ignoring the will of the majority of 
the organisations in promoting comrades to responsible

J. V. S T A L I N 372 
Party posts, and we must see to it that the principle 
of election is actually applied. 
Fourthly, there must exist under the Central Committee 
and the Gubernia and Regional Committees permanently 
functioning conferences of responsible workers 
in all fields of work‹economic, Party, trade-union and 
military; these conferences must be held regularly and 
discuss any question they consider it necessary to discuss; 
the interconnection between the workers in all fields 
must not be broken; all these workers must feel that 
they are all members of a single Party family, working 
in a common cause, the cause of the proletariat, which 
is indivisible; the Central Committee and the local organisations 
must create an environment that will enable 
the Party to acquire and test the experience of our responsible 
workers in all spheres of work. 
Fifthly, our Party units in the factories must be 
drawn into dealing with the various questions relating 
to the course of affairs in the respective enterprises and 
trusts. Things must be so arranged that the units are 
kept informed about the work of the administrations 
of our enterprises and trusts and are able to exert an 
influence on this work. You, as representatives of units, 
are aware how great is the moral responsibility of our 
factory units to the non-Party masses for the course of 
affairs in the factories. For the unit to be able to lead 
and win the following of the non-Party masses in the 
factory, for it to be able to bear responsibility for the 
course of affairs in the factory‹and it certainly has a 
moral responsibility to the non-Party masses for defects 
in the work of the factory‹the unit must be kept informed 
about these affairs, it must be possible for it to in

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 373 
fluence them in one way or another. Therefore, the units 
must be drawn into the discussion of economic questions 
relating to their factories, and economic conferences 
of representatives of the factory units in a given trust 
must be called from time to time to discuss questions 
relating to the affairs of the trust. This is one of the surest 
ways both of enlarging the economic experience of 
the Party membership and of organising control from 
below. 
Sixthly, the quality of the membership of our Party 
units must be improved. Zinoviev has already said in 
an article of his that here and there the quality of the 
membership of our Party units is below that of the 
surrounding non-Party masses. 
That statement, of course, must not be generalised 
and applied to all the units. It would be more exact 
to say the following for example: our Party units would 
be on a much higher cultural level than they are now, 
and would have much greater authority among non- 
Party people, if we had not denuded these units, if we 
had not taken from them people we needed for economic, 
administrative, trade-union and all sorts of other work. 
If our working-class comrades, the cadres we have taken 
from the units during the past six years, were to return 
to their units, does it need proof that those units would 
stand head and shoulders above all the non-Party workers, 
even the most advanced? Precisely because the 
Party has no other cadres with which to improve the 
state apparatus, precisely because the Party will be 
obliged to continue using that source, our units will 
remain on a somewhat unsatisfactory cultural level unless 
we take urgent measures to improve the quality

J. V. S T A L I N 374 
of their membership. First of all, Party educational work 
in the units must be increased to the utmost; furthermore, 
we must get rid of the excessive formalism our local 
organisations sometimes display in accepting workingclass 
comrades into the Party. I think that we must not 
allow ourselves to be bound by formalism; the Party can, 
and must, create easier conditions for the acceptance of 
new members from the ranks of the working class. That 
has already begun in the local organisations. The Party 
must take this matter in hand and launch an organised 
campaign for creating easier access to the Party for new 
members from workers at the bench. 
Seventhly, work must be intensified among the non- 
Party workers. This is another means of improving the 
internal Party situation, of increasing the activity of 
the Party membership. I must say that our organisations 
are still paying little attention to the task of drawing 
non-Party workers into our Soviets. Take, for example, 
the elections to the Moscow Soviet that are being held 
now. I consider that one of the big defects in these elections 
is that too few non-Party people are being elected. 
It is said that there exists a decision of the organisation to 
the effect that at least a certain number, a certain percentage, 
etc., of non-Party people are to be elected; but I see 
that, in fact, a far smaller number is being elected. It is 
said that the masses are eager to elect only Communists. I 
have my doubts about that, comrades. I think that unless 
we show a certain degree of confidence in the non- 
Party people they may answer by becoming very distrustful 
of our organisations. This confidence in the non- 
Party people is absolutely necessary, comrades. Communists 
must be induced to withdraw their candidatures.

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 375 
Speeches must not be delivered urging the election only 
of Communists; non-Party people must be encouraged, 
they must be drawn into the work of administering the 
state. We shall gain by this and in return receive the 
reciprocal confidence of the non-Party people in our organisations. 
The elections in Moscow are an example 
of the degree to which our organisations are beginning 
to isolate themselves within their Party shell instead 
of enlarging their field of activity and, step by step, 
rallying the non-Party people around themselves. 
Eighthly, work among the peasants must be intensified. 
I do not know why our village units, which in 
some places are wilting, are losing their members and 
are not trusted much by the peasants (this must be 
admitted)‹I do not know why, for instance, two practical 
tasks cannot be set these units: firstly, to interpret 
and popularise the Soviet laws which affect peasant 
life; secondly, to agitate for and disseminate elementary 
agronomic knowledge, if only the knowledge that it is 
necessary to plough the fields in proper time, to sift 
seed, etc. Do you know, comrades, that if every peasant 
were to decide to devote a little labour to the sifting 
of seed, it would be possible without land improvement, 
and without introducing new machines, to obtain an increase 
in crop yield amounting to about ten poods per 
dessiatin? And what does an increase in crop yield of ten 
poods per dessiatin mean? It means an increase in the 
gross crop of a thousand million poods per annum. And 
all this could be achieved without great effort. Why should 
not our village units take up this matter? Is it less important 
than talking about Curzon¹s policy? The peasants 
would then realise that the Communists have stopped

J. V. S T A L I N 376 
engaging in empty talk and have got down to real 
business; and then our village units would win the boundless 
confidence of the peasants. 
There is no need for me to stress how necessary it 
is, for improving and reviving Party life, to intensify 
Party and political educational work among the youth, 
the source of new cadres, in the Red Army, among women 
delegates, and among non-Party people in general. 
Nor will I dwell upon the importance of increasing 
the interchange of information, about which I have already 
spoken, of increasing the supply of information 
from the top downwards and from below upwards. 
Such, comrades, are the measures for improvement, 
the course towards internal Party democracy which the 
Central Committee set as far back as September of this 
year, and which must be put into practice by all Party 
organisations from top to bottom. 
I would now like to deal with two extremes, two 
obsessions, on the question of workers¹ democracy that 
were to be noted in some of the discussion articles in 
Pravda. 
The first extreme concerns the election principle. 
It manifests itself in some comrades wanting to have 
elections ³throughout.² Since we stand for the election 
principle, let us go the whole hog in electing! Party 
standing? What do we want that for? Elect whomever 
you please. That is a mistaken view, comrades. The 
Party will not accept it. Of course, we are not now at 
war; we are in a period of peaceful development. But we 
are now living under the NEP. Do not forget that, 
comrades. The Party began the purge not during, but 
after the war. Why? Because, during the war, fear of

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 377 
defeat drew the Party together into one whole, and some 
of the disruptive elements in the Party were compelled 
to keep to the general line of the Party, which was faced 
with the question of life or death. Now these bonds have 
fallen away, for we are not now at war; now we have 
the NEP, we have permitted a revival of capitalism, and 
the bourgeoisie is reviving. True, all this helps to purge 
the Party, to strengthen it; but on the other hand, we 
are being enveloped in a new atmosphere by the nascent 
and growing bourgeoisie, which is not very strong 
yet, but which has already succeeded in beating some 
of our co-operatives and trading organisations in internal 
trade. It was precisely after the introduction of 
the NEP that the Party began the purge and reduced 
its membership by half; it was precisely after the introduction 
of the NEP that the Party decided that, in 
order to protect our organisations from the contagion 
of the NEP, it was necessary, for example, to hinder 
the influx of non-proletarian elements into the Party, 
that it was necessary that Party officials should have 
a definite Party standing, and so forth. Was the Party 
right in taking these precautionary measures, which restricted 
³expanded² democracy? I think it was. That is 
why I think that we must have democracy, we must have 
the election principle, but the restrictive measures 
that were adopted by the Eleventh and Twelfth Congresses, 
at least the chief ones, must still remain in force. 
The second extreme concerns the question of the limits 
of the discussion. This extreme manifests itself 
in some comrades demanding unlimited discussion; they 
think that the discussion of problems is the be all and 
end all of Party work and forget about the other aspect

J. V. S T A L I N 378 
of Party work, namely, action, which calls for the implementation 
of the Party¹s decisions. At all events, this 
was the impression I gained from the short article by 
Radzin, who tried to substantiate the principle of unlimited 
discussion by a reference to Trotsky, who is alleged 
to have said that ³the Party is a voluntary association 
of like-minded people.² I searched for that sentence 
in Trotsky¹s works, but could not find it. Trotsky could 
scarcely have uttered it as a finished formula for the definition 
of the Party; and if he did utter it, he could scarcely 
have stopped there. The Party is not only an association 
of like-minded people; it is also an association 
of like-acting people, it is a militant association of likeacting 
people who are fighting on a common ideological 
basis (programme, tactics). I think that the reference to 
Trotsky is out of place, for I know Trotsky as one of 
the members of the Central Committee who most of all 
stress the active side of Party work. I think, therefore, 
that Radzin himself must bear responsibility for this 
definition. But what does this definition lead to? One 
of two possibilities: either that the Party will degenerate 
into a sect, into a philosophical school, for only 
in such narrow organisations is complete like-mindedness 
possible; or that it will become a permanent debating 
society, eternally discussing and eternally arguing, until 
the point is reached where factions form and the Party 
is split. Our Party cannot accept either of these possibilities. 
This is why I think that the discussion of problems 
is needed, a discussion is needed, but limits must 
be set to such discussion in order to safeguard the Party, 
to safeguard this fighting unit of the proletariat, against 
degenerating into a debating society.

THE PARTY¹S TASKS 379 
In concluding my report, I must warn you, comrades, 
against these two extremes. I think that if we reject 
both these extremes and honestly and resolutely steer 
the course towards internal Party democracy that the 
Central Committee set already in September of this 
year, we shall certainly achieve an improvement in our 
Party work. (Applause.) 
Pravda, No. 277, 
December 6, 1923

THE DISCUSSION, 
RAFAIL, THE ARTICLES 
BY PREOBRAZHENSKY AND SAPRONOV, 
AND TROTSKY¹S LETTER 
THE DISCUSSION 
The discussion on the situation within the Party 
that opened a few weeks ago is evidently drawing to a 
close; that is, as far as Moscow and Petrograd are concerned. 
As is known, Petrograd has declared in favour 
of the line of the Party. The principal districts of Moscow 
have also declared in favour of the Central Committee¹s 
line. The general city meeting of active workers 
of the Moscow organisation held on December 11 fully 
endorsed the organisational and political line of the 
Central Committee of the Party. There is no ground for 
doubting that the forthcoming general Party conference 
of the Moscow organisation will follow in the footsteps 
of its districts. The opposition, which is a bloc of a section 
of the ³Left² Communists (Preobrazhensky, Stukov, 
Pyatakov, and others) with the so-called Democratic 
Centralists (Rafail, Sapronov, and others), has suffered 
a crushing defeat. 
The course of the discussion, and the changes that the 
opposition went through during the period of the discussion, 
are interesting. 
The opposition began by demanding nothing more nor 
less than a revision of the main line in internal Party

THE DISCUSSION 381 
affairs and internal Party policy which the Party 
has been pursuing during the past two years, during the 
whole NEP period. While demanding the full implementation 
of the resolution passed by the Tenth Congress 
on internal Party democracy, the opposition at the same 
time insisted on the removal of the restrictions (prohibition 
of groups, the Party-standing rule, etc.) that were 
adopted by the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Party Congresses. 
But the opposition did not stop at this. It asserted 
that the Party has practically been turned into an 
army type of organisation, that Party discipline has 
been turned into military discipline, and demanded that 
the entire staff of the Party apparatus be shaken up from 
top to bottom, that the principal responsible workers 
be removed from their posts, etc. Of strong language and 
abuse of the Central Committee there was, of course, 
no lack. The columns of Pravda were replete with articles, 
long and short, accusing the Central Committee of all 
the mortal sins. It is a wonder that it was not accused of 
causing the earthquake in Japan. 
During this period the Central Committee as a whole 
did not intervene in the discussion in the columns of 
Pravda, leaving the members of the Party full freedom 
to criticise. It did not even think it necessary to repudiate 
the absurd charges that were often made by critics, 
being of the opinion that the members of the Party are 
sufficiently politically conscious to decide the questions 
under discussion themselves. 
That was, so to speak, the first period of the discussion. 
Later, when people got tired of strong language, 
when abuse ceased to have effect and the members of

J. V. S T A L I N 382 
the Party demanded a business-like discussion 
of the question, the second period of the discussion 
set in. This period opened with the publication of 
the resolution of the Central Committee and the Central 
Control Commission on Party affairs.82 On the 
basis of the decision of the October Plenum of the Central 
Committee,83 which endorsed the course towards 
internal Party democracy, the Political Bureau of the 
Central Committee and the Presidium of the Central 
Control Commission drew up the well-known resolution 
indicating the conditions for giving effect to internal 
Party democracy. This marked a turning point in the 
discussion. It now became impossible to keep to general 
criticism. When the Central Committee and the Central 
Control Commission presented their concrete plan the 
opposition was faced with the alternative of either accepting 
this plan or of presenting a parallel, equally concrete, 
plan of i t s own for giving effect to internal Party 
democracy. At once it was discovered that the opposition 
was unable to counter the Central Committee¹s plan with 
a plan of its own that would satisfy the demands of the 
Party organisations. The opposition began to retreat. 
The demand for cancellation of the main line of the past 
two years in internal Party affairs ceased to be 
part of the opposition¹s arsenal. The demand of the opposition 
for the removal of the restrictions on democracy 
that were adopted by the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth 
Party Congresses also paled and faded. The opposition 
pushed into the background and moderated its demand 
that the apparatus be shaken up from top to bottom. 
It deemed it wise to substitute for all these demands 
the proposals that it was necessary ³to formulate pre

THE DISCUSSION 383 
cisely the question of factions,² ³to arrange for the election 
of all Party bodies which hitherto have been appointed,² 
³to abolish the appointment system,² etc. It is 
characteristic that even these much moderated proposals 
of the opposition were rejected by the Krasnaya Presnya 
and Zamoskvorechye district Party organisations, 
which endorsed the resolution of the Central Committee 
and the Central Control Commission by overwhelming 
majorities. 
This was, so to speak, the second period of the discussion. 
We have now entered the third period. The characteristic 
feature of this period is the further retreat, I would 
say the disorderly retreat, of the opposition. This time, 
even the latter¹s faded and much moderated demands 
have dropped out of its resolution. Preobrazhensky¹s 
last resolution (the third, I think), which was submitted 
to the meeting of active workers of the Moscow organisation 
(over 1,000 present), reads as follows: 
³Only the speedy, unanimous and sincere implementation 
of the Political Bureau¹s resolutions and, in particular, the renovation 
of the internal Party apparatus by means of new elections, 
can guarantee our Party¹s transition to the new course without 
shocks and internal struggle, and strengthen the actual solidarity 
and unity of its ranks.² 
The fact that the meeting rejected even this very 
innocuous proposal of the opposition cannot be regarded 
as accidental. Nor was it an accident that the meeting, 
by an overwhelming majority, adopted a resolution ³to 
endorse the political and organisational line of the Central 
Committee.²

J. V. S T A L I N 384 
RAFAIL 
I think that Rafail is the most consistent and thorough 
going representative of the present opposition, or, 
to be more exact, of the present opposition bloc. At one 
of the discussion meetings Rafail said that our Party has 
practically been turned into an army organisation, that 
its discipline is army discipline, and that, in view of 
this, it is necessary to shake up the entire Party apparatus 
from top to bottom, because it is unfit and alien to 
the genuine Party spirit. It seems to me that these or 
similar thoughts are floating in the minds of the members 
of the present opposition, but for various reasons 
they dare not express them. It must be admitted that 
in this respect Rafail has proved to be bolder than his 
colleagues in the opposition. 
Nevertheless, Rafail is absolutely wrong. He is wrong 
not only from the formal aspect, but also, and primarily, 
in substance. If our Party has indeed been turned, or 
is even only beginning to be turned, into an army organisation, 
is it not obvious that we would now have neither 
a Party in the proper sense of the term, nor the dictatorship 
of the proletariat, nor the revolution? 
What is an army? 
An army is a self-contained organisation built from 
above. The very nature of an army presupposes the existence 
at its head of a General Staff, which is appointed 
from above, and which forms the army on the principle 
of compulsion. The General Staff not only forms the army, 
but also supplies it with food, clothing, footwear, etc. 
The material dependence of the entire army on the General 
Staff is complete. This, incidentally, is the basis

THE DISCUSSION 385 
of that army discipline, breach of which entails a specific 
form of the supreme penalty‹death by shooting. This 
also explains the fact that the General Staff can move 
the army wherever and whenever it pleases, guided only 
by its own strategic plans. 
What is the Party? 
The Party is the advanced detachment of the proletariat, 
built from below on the voluntary principle. The 
Party also has its General Staff, but it is not appointed 
from above, it is elected from below by the whole Party. 
The General Staff does not form the Party; on the 
contrary, the Party forms its General Staff. The Party 
forms itself on the voluntary principle. Nor does 
there exist that material dependence of the Party as a 
whole upon its General Staff that we spoke of above in 
relation to the army. The Party General Staff does not 
provide the Party with supplies, does not feed and clothe 
it. This, incidentally, explains the fact that the Party 
General Staff cannot move the ranks of the Party arbitrarily 
wherever and whenever it pleases, that the Party 
General Staff can lead the Party as a whole only in conformity 
with the economic and political interests of the 
class of which the Party is itself a part. Hence the specific 
character of Party discipline, which, in the main, 
is based on the method of persuasion, as distinct from 
army discipline, which, in the main, is based on the 
method of compulsion. Hence the fundamental difference 
between the supreme penalty in the Party (expulsion) 
and the supreme penalty in the army (death by 
shooting). 
It is sufficient to compare these two definitions to 
realise how monstrous is Rafail¹s mistake.

J. V. S T A L I N 386 
The Party, he says, has been turned into an army organisation. 
But how is it possible to turn the Party into 
an army organisation if it is not materially dependent 
upon its General Staff, if it is built from below on the 
voluntary principle, and if it itself forms its General 
Staff? How, then, can one explain the influx of workers 
into the Party, the growth of its influence among the 
non-Party masses, its popularity among working people 
all over the world? 
One of two things: 
Either the Party is utterly passive and voiceless‹ 
but then how is one to explain the fact that such a passive 
and voiceless party is the leader of the most revolutionary 
proletariat in the world and for several years 
already has been governing the most revolutionary country 
in the world? 
Or the Party is active and displays initiative‹but 
then one cannot understand why a party, which is so 
active, which displays such initiative, has not by now 
overthrown the military regime in the Party, assuming 
that such a regime actually reigns in the Party. 
Is it not clear that our Party, which has made three 
revolutions, which routed Kolchak and Denikin, and 
is now shaking the foundations of world imperialism, 
that this Party would not have tolerated for one week 
that military regime and order-and-obey system that 
Rafail talks about so lightly and recklessly, that it would 
have smashed them in a trice, and would have introduced 
a new regime without waiting for a call from Rafail? 
But: a frightful dream, but thank God only a dream. 
The fact of the matter is, firstly, that Rafail confused 
the Party with an army and an army with the Party,

THE DISCUSSION 387 
for, evidently, he is not clear in his mind about what 
the Party and what an army is. Secondly, the fact of the 
matter is that, evidently, Rafail himself does not believe 
in his discovery; he is forced to utter ³frightful² words 
about an order-and-obey system in the Party so as to 
justify the principal slogans of the present opposition: 
a) freedom to form factional groups; and b) removal 
from their posts of the leading elements of the Party from 
top to bottom. 
Evidently, Rafail feels that it is impossible to push 
through these slogans without the aid of ³frightful² words. 
That is the whole essence of the matter. 
PREOBRAZHENSKY¹S ARTICLE 
Preobrazhensky thinks that the chief cause of the 
defects in internal Party life is that the main Party line 
in Party affairs is wrong. He asserts that ³for two 
years now, the Party has been pursuing an essentially 
wrong line in its internal Party policy,² that ³the Party¹s 
main line in internal Party affairs and internal 
Party policy during the N.E.P. period² has proved to 
be wrong. 
What has been the Party¹s main line since the N.E.P. 
was introduced? At its Tenth Congress, the Party adopted 
a resolution on workers¹ democracy. Was the Party 
right in adopting such a resolution? Preobrazhensky thinks 
it was right. At the same Tenth Congress the Party imposed 
a very severe restriction on democracy in the shape 
of the ban on the formation of groups. Was the Party 
right in imposing such a restriction? Preobrazhensky 
thinks that the Party was wrong, because, in his opinion,

J. V. S T A L I N 388 
such a restriction shackles independent Party thinking. 
At the Eleventh Congress the Party imposed further restrictions 
on democracy in the shape of the definite Party-
standing rule, etc. The Twelfth Party Congress only 
reaffirmed these restrictions. Was the Party right in 
imposing these restrictions as a safeguard against pettybourgeois 
tendencies under the conditions created by the 
N.E.P.? Preobrazhensky thinks that the Party was wrong, 
because, in his opinion, these restrictions shackled the 
initiative of the Party organisations. The conclusion is 
obvious: Preobrazhensky proposes that the Party¹s main 
line in this sphere that was adopted at the Tenth and 
Eleventh Congresses under the conditions created by the 
N.E.P. should be rescinded. 
The Tenth and Eleventh Congresses, however, took 
place under the direct leadership of Comrade Lenin. The 
resolution of the Tenth Congress prohibiting the formation 
of groups (the resolution on unity) was moved and 
steered through the congress by Comrade Lenin. The 
subsequent restrictions on democracy in the shape of 
the definite Party-standing rule, etc., were adopted by 
the Eleventh Congress with the close participation of 
Comrade Lenin. Does not Preobrazhensky realise that, 
in effect, he is proposing that the Party line under the 
conditions created by the NEP, the line that is organically 
connected with Leninism, should be rescinded? Is not 
Preobrazhensky beginning to understand that his proposal 
to rescind the Party¹s main line in Party affairs 
under the conditions created by the NEP is, in effect, 
a repetition of some of the proposals in the notorious 
³anonymous platform,²84 which demanded the revision 
of Leninism?

THE DISCUSSION 389 
It is sufficient to put these questions to realise that 
the Party will not follow in Preobrazhensky¹s footsteps. 
What, indeed, does Preobrazhensky propose? He proposes 
nothing more nor less than a reversion to Party 
life ³on the lines of 1917-18.² What distinguished the 
years 1917-18 in this respect? The fact that, at that 
time, we had groups and factions in our Party, that there 
was an open fight between the groups at that time, that 
the Party was then passing through a critical period, 
during which its fate hung in the balance. Preobrazhensky 
is demanding that this state of affairs in the Party, 
a state of affairs that was abolished by the Tenth Congress, 
should be restored, at least ³partly.² Can the 
Party take this path? No, it cannot. Firstly, because 
the restoration of Party life on the lines that existed 
in 1917-18, when there was no NEP, does not, and 
cannot, meet the Party¹s needs under the conditions prevailing 
in 1923, when there is the NEP. Secondly, because 
the restoration of the former situation of factional 
struggle would inevitably result in the disruption of 
Party unity, especially now that Comrade Lenin is 
absent. 
Preobrazhensky is inclined to depict the conditions 
of internal Party life in 1917-18 as something desirable 
and ideal. But we know of a great many dark sides of 
this period of internal Party life, which caused the Party 
very severe shocks. I do not think that the internal 
Party struggle among the Bolsheviks ever reached such 
intensity as it did in that period, the period of the Brest 
Peace. It is well known, for example, that the ³Left² 
Communists, who at that time constituted a separate

J. V. S T A L I N 390 
faction, went to the length of talking seriously about 
replacing the existing Council of People¹s Commissars 
by an other Council of People¹s Commissars consisting of 
new people belonging to the ³Left² communist faction. 
Some of the members of the present opposition‹Preobrazhensky, 
Pyatakov, Stukov and others‹then belonged 
to the ³Left² communist faction. 
Is Preobrazhensky thinking of ³restoring² those old 
³ideal² conditions in our Party? 
It is obvious, at all events, that the Party will not 
agree to this ³restoration.² 
SAPRONOV¹S ARTICLE 
Sapronov thinks that the chief cause of the defects 
in internal Party life is the presence in the Party¹s 
apparatuses of ³Party pedants,² ³schoolmistresses,² who 
are busy ³teaching the Party members² according to 
³the school method,² and are thus hindering the real 
training of the Party members in the course of the struggle. 
Although dubbing the responsible workers in our 
Party apparatus ³schoolmistresses,² Sapronov does not 
think of asking where these people came from, and how 
it came to pass that ³Party pedants² gained control of 
the work of our Party. Advancing this more than reckless 
and demagogic proposition as proved, Sapronov forgot 
that a Marxist cannot be satisfied with mere assertions, 
but must first of all understand a phenomenon, if it 
really exists at all, and explain it, in order then to propose 
effective measures for improvement. But evidently Sapronov 
does not care a rap about Marxism. He wants at 
all costs to malign the Party apparatus‹and all the rest

THE DISCUSSION 391 
will follow. And so, in Sapronov¹s opinion, the evil will 
of ³Party pedants² is the cause of the defects in our internal 
Party life. An excellent explanation, it must be 
admitted. 
Only we do not understand: 
1) How could these ³schoolmistresses² and ³Party 
pedants² retain the leadership of the most revolutionary 
proletariat in the world? 
2) How could our ³Party schoolchildren² who are 
being taught by these ³schoolmistresses² retain the leadership 
of the most revolutionary country in the world? 
At all events it is clear that it is easier to talk about 
³Party pedants² than to understand and appreciate the 
very great merit of our Party apparatus. 
How does Sapronov propose to remedy the defects 
in our internal Party life? His remedy is as simple as his 
diagnosis. ³Change our officers,² remove the present 
responsible workers from their posts‹such is Sapronov¹s 
remedy. This he regards as the principal guarantee that 
internal Party democracy will be practised. From the 
point of view of democracy, I am far from denying the 
importance of new elections as a means of improving our 
internal Party life; but to regard that as the principal 
guarantee means to understand neither internal Party 
life nor its defects. In the ranks of the opposition there 
are men like Byeloborodov, whose ³democracy² is still 
remembered by the workers in Rostov; Rosenholtz, whose 
³democracy² was a misery to our water transport workers 
and railwaymen; Pyatakov, whose ³democracy² 
made the whole of the Donets Basin not only cry out, 
but positively howl; Alsky, with the nature of whose 
³democracy² everybody is familiar; Byk, from whose

J. V. S T A L I N 392 
³democracy² Khorezm is still groaning. Does Sapronov 
think that i f the places of the ³Party pedants² are 
taken by the ³esteemed comrades² enumerated above, 
democracy will triumph in the Party? Permit me to have 
some doubts about that. 
Evidently, there are two kinds of democracy: the 
democracy of the mass of Party members, who are eager 
to display initiative and to take an active part in the 
work of Party leadership, and the ³democracy² of disgruntled 
Party big-wigs who think that dismissing some 
and putting others in their place is the essence of democracy. 
The Party will stand for the first kind of democracy 
and will carry it out with an iron hand. But the Party 
will throw out the ³democracy² of the disgruntled Party 
big-wigs, which has nothing in common with genuine 
internal Party democracy, workers¹ democracy. 
To ensure internal Party democracy it is necessary, 
first of all, to rid the minds of some of our responsible 
workers of the survivals and habits of the war period, 
which cause them to regard the Party not as an independently 
acting organism, but as a system of official 
institutions. But these survivals cannot be got rid of in 
a short space of time. 
To ensure internal Party democracy it is necessary, 
secondly, to do away with the pressure exerted by our 
bureaucratic state apparatus, which has about a million 
employees, upon our Party apparatus, which has no more 
than 20,000-30,000 workers. But it is impossible to do 
away with the pressure of this cumbersome machine and 
gain mastery over it in a short space of time. 
To ensure internal Party democracy it is necessary, 
thirdly, to raise the cultural level of our backward units,

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


DISTRIBUTION 
393 
of which there are quite a number, and to distribute 
our active workers correctly over the entire territory 
of the Union; but that, too, can not be achieved in a 
short space of time. 
As you see, to ensure complete democracy is not so 
simple a matter as Sapronov thinks, that is, of course, if 
by democracy we mean not Sapronov¹s empty, formal 
democracy, but real, workers¹, genuine democracy. 
Obviously, the entire Party from top to bottom must 
exert its will to ensure and put into effect genuine 
internal Party democracy. 
TROTSKY¹S LETTER 
The resolution of the Central Committee and the Central 
Control Commission on internal Party democracy, 
published on December 7, was adopted unanimously. 
Trotsky voted for this resolution. It might have been 
expected, therefore, that the members of the Central 
Committee, including Trotsky, would come forward in 
a united front with a call to Party members for unanimous 
support of the Central Committee and its resolution. 
This expectation, however, has not been realised. 
The other day Trotsky issued a letter to the Party conferences 
which cannot be interpreted otherwise than as 
an attempt to weaken the will of the Party membership 
for unity in supporting the Central Committee and its 
position. 
Judge for yourselves. 
After referring to bureaucracy in the Party apparatus 
and the danger of degeneration of the old guard, i.e., 
the Leninists, the main core of our Party, Trotsky writes: 
THE DISCUSSION

J. V. S T A L I N 394 
³The degeneration of the Œold guard¹ has been observed in history 
more than once. Let us take the latest and most glaring historical 
example: the leaders and the parties of the Second International. 
We know that Wilhelm Liebknecht, Bebel, Singer, 
Victor Adler, Kautsky, Bernstein, Lafargue, Guesde, and others, 
were the immediate and direct pupils of Marx and Engels. We 
know, however, that all those leaders‹some partly, and others 
wholly‹degenerated into opportunism.². . . ³We, that is, we 
Œold ones,¹ must say that our generation, which naturally plays 
a leading role in the Party, has no self-sufficient guarantee against 
the gradual and imperceptible weakening of the proletarian and 
revolutionary spirit, assuming that the Party tolerates a further 
growth and consolidation of the bureaucratic-apparatus methods 
of policy which are transforming the younger generation into 
passive educational material and are inevitably creating estrangement 
between the apparatus and the membership, between 
the old and the young.². . . ³The youth‹the Party¹s truest 
barometer‹react most sharply of all against Party bureaucracy.². 
. . ³The youth must capture the revolutionary formulas 
by storm. . . .² 
First, I must dispel a possible misunderstanding. 
As is evident from his letter, Trotsky includes himself 
among the Bolshevik old guard, thereby showing readiness 
to take upon himself the charges that may be hurled 
at the old guard if i t does indeed take the path of 
degeneration. It must be admitted that this readiness 
for self-sacrifice is undoubtedly a noble trait. But I must 
protect Trotsky from Trotsky, because, for obvious reasons, 
he cannot, and should not, bear responsibility for 
the possible degeneration of the principal cadres of the 
Bolshevik old guard. Sacrifice is a good thing, of course, 
but do the old Bolsheviks need it? I think that they 
do not. 
Secondly, it is impossible to understand how opportunists 
and Mensheviks like Bernstein, Adler, Kautsky,

THE DISCUSSION 395 
Guesde, and the others, can be put on a par with the 
Bolshevik old guard, which has always fought, and I 
hope will continue to fight with honour, against opportunism, 
the Mensheviks and the Second International. What 
is the cause of this muddle and confusion? Who needs it, 
bearing in mind the interests of the Party and not ulterior 
motives that by no means aim at defence of the 
old guard? How is one to interpret these insinuations 
about opportunism in relation to the old Bolsheviks, 
who matured in the struggle against opportunism? 
Thirdly, I do not by any means think that the old 
Bolsheviks are absolutely guaranteed against the danger 
of degeneration any more than I have grounds for asserting 
that we are absolutely guaranteed against, say, an 
earthquake. As a possibility, such a danger can and should 
be assumed. But does this mean that such a danger is 
real, that it exists? I think that it does not. Trotsky himself 
has adduced no evidence to show that the danger 
of degeneration is a real danger. Nevertheless, there are 
a number of elements within our Party who are capable 
of giving rise to a real danger of degeneration of certain 
ranks of our Party. I have in mind that section of 
the Mensheviks who joined our Party unwillingly, 
and who have not yet got rid of their old opportunist 
habits. The following is what Comrade Lenin wrote about 
these Mensheviks, and about this danger, at the time 
of the Party purge: 
³Every opportunist is distinguished for his adaptability . . . 
and the Mensheviks, as opportunists, adapt themselves Œon principle,¹ 
so to speak, to the prevailing trend among the workers 
and assume a protective colouring, just as a hare¹s coat turns 
white in the winter. It is necessary to know this specific feature

J. V. S T A L I N 396 
of the Mensheviks and take it into account. And taking it into 
account means purging the Party of approximately ninety-nine 
out of every hundred of the Mensheviks who joined the Russian 
Communist Party after 1918, i.e., when the victory of the Bolsheviks 
first became probable and then certain.² (see Vol. XXVII, 
p. 13.) 
How could it happen that Trotsky, who lost sight of 
this and similar, really existing dangers, pushed into 
the foreground a possible danger, the danger of the degeneration 
of the Bolshevik old guard? How can one shut 
one¹s eyes to a real danger and push into the foreground 
an unreal, possible danger, if one has the interests of the 
Party in view and not the object of undermining the prestige 
of the majority in the Central Committee, the leading 
core of the Bolshevik old guard? Is it not obvious that 
³approaches² of this kind can only bring grist to the 
mill of the opposition? 
Fourthly, what reasons did Trotsky have for contrasting 
the ³old ones,² who may degenerate, to the 
³youth,² the Party¹s ³truest barometer²; for contrasting 
the ³old guard,² who may become bureaucratic, to the 
³young guard,² which must ³capture the revolutionary 
formulas by storm²? What grounds had he for drawing 
this contrast, and what did he need it for? Have not the 
youth and the old guard always marched in a united 
front against internal and external enemies? Is not the 
unity between the ³old ones² and the ³young ones² 
the basic strength of our revolution? What was the object 
of this attempt to discredit the old guard and demagogically 
to flatter the youth if not to cause and widen a 
fissure between these principal detachments of our Party? 
Who needs all this, if one has the interests of the Party

THE DISCUSSION 397 
in view, its unity and solidarity, and not an attempt to 
shake this unity for the benefit of the opposition? 
Is that the way to defend the Central Committee and 
its resolution on internal Party democracy, which, moreover, 
was adopted unanimously? 
But evidently, that was not Trotsky¹s object in issuing 
his letter to the Party conferences. Evidently 
there was a different intention here, namely: diplomatically 
to support the opposition in its struggle against 
the Central Committee of the Party while pretending to 
support the Central Committee¹s resolution. 
That, in fact, explains the stamp of duplicity that 
Trotsky¹s letter bears. 
Trotsky is in a bloc with the Democratic Centralists 
and with a section of the ³Left² Communists‹therein 
lies the political significance of Trotsky¹s action.

A NECESSARY COMMENT 
(Concerning Rafail) 
In my article in Pravda (No. 285) ³The Discussion, 
Rafail, etc.² I said that according to a statement Rafail 
made at a meeting in the Presnya District ³our 
Party has practically been turned into an army organisation, 
its discipline is army discipline and, in view 
of this, it is necessary to shake up the entire Party apparatus 
from top to bottom, because it is unfit.² Concerning 
this, Rafail says in his article in Pravda that 
I did not correctly convey his views, that I ³simplified² 
them ³in the heat of debate,² and so forth. Rafail 
says that he merely drew an analogy (comparison) 
between the Party and an army, that analogy is not 
identity. ³The system of administration in the Party 
is analogous to the system of administration in an 
army‹this does not mean,² he says, ³that it is an exact 
copy; it only draws a parallel.² 
Is Rafail right? 
No. And for the following reasons. 
First. In his speech at the meeting in the Presnya 
District, Rafail did not simply compare the Party with 
an army, as he now asserts, but actually identified it 
with an army, being of the opinion that the Party is

A NECESSARY COMMENT 399 
built on the lines of an army. I have before me the verbatim 
report of Rafail¹s speech, revised by the speaker. 
There it is stated: ³Our entire Party is built on the 
lines of an army from top to bottom.² It can scarcely 
be denied that we have here not simply an analogy, 
but an identification of the Party¹s structure with that 
of an army; the two are placed on a par. 
Can it be asserted that our Party is built on the 
lines of an army? Obviously not, for the Party is built 
from below, on the voluntary principle; it is not materially 
dependent on its General Staff, which the Party 
elects. An army, however, is, of course, built from above, 
on the basis of compulsion; it is completely dependent 
materially upon its General Staff, which is not elected, 
but appointed from above. Etc., etc. 
Secondly. Rafail does not simply compare the system 
of administration in the Party with that in an army, 
but puts one on a par with the other, identifies them, 
without any ³verbal frills.² This is what he writes in 
his article: ³We assert that the system of administration 
in the Party is identical with the system of administration 
in an army not on any extraneous grounds, but 
on the basis of an objective analysis of the state of the 
Party.² It is impossible to deny that here Rafail does 
not confine himself to drawing an analogy between the 
administration of the Party and that of an army, for 
he ³simply² identifies them, ³without verbal frills.² 
Can these two systems of administration be identified? 
No, they cannot; for the system of administration 
in an army, as a system, is incompatible with the very 
nature of the Party and with its methods of influencing 
both its own members and the non-Party masses.

J. V. S T A L I N 400 
Thirdly. Rafail asserts in his article that, in the last 
analysis, the fate of the Party as a whole, and of its 
individual members, depends upon the Registration and 
Distribution Department of the Central Committee, 
that ³the members of the Party are regarded as mobilised, 
the Registration and Distribution Department 
puts everybody in his job, nobody has the slightest right 
to choose his work, and it is the Registration and Distribution 
Department, or ŒGeneral Staff,¹ that determines 
the amount of supplies, i.e., pay, form of work, 
etc.² Is all this true? Of course not! In peace time, 
the Registration and Distribution Department of the 
Central Committee usually deals in the course of a year 
with barely eight to ten thousand people. We know 
from the Central Committee¹s report to the Twelfth 
Congress of the R.C.P.85 that, in 1922, the Registration 
and Distribution Department of the Central Committee 
dealt with 10,700 people (i.e., half the number it dealt 
with in 1921). If from this number we subtract 1,500 
people sent by their local organisations to various educational 
institutions, and the people who went on sick 
leave (over 400), there remain something over 8,000. 
Of these, the Central Committee, in the course of the 
year, distributed 5,167 responsible workers (i.e., less than 
half of the total number dealt with by the Registration 
and Distribution Department). But at that time the Party 
as a whole had not 5,000, and not 10,000, but about 
500,000 members, the bulk of whom were not, and could 
not, be affected by the distribution work of the Registration 
and Distribution Department of the Central Committee. 
Evidently, Rafail has forgotten that in peace 
time the Central Committee usually distributes only

A NECESSARY COMMENT 401 
responsible workers, that the Registration and Distribution 
Department of the Central Committee does 
not, cannot, and should not, determine the ³pay² of all 
the members of the Party, who now number over 400,000. 
Why did Rafail have to exaggerate in this ridiculous 
way? Evidently, in order to prove ³with facts² the 
³identity² between the system of administration in the 
Party and that in an army. 
Such are the facts. 
That is why I thought, and s t i l l think, that Rafail 
³is not clear in his mind about what the Party and 
what an army is.² 
As regards the passages Rafail quotes from the decisions 
of the Tenth Congress, they have nothing to do 
with the present case, for they apply only to the survivals 
of the war period in our Party and not to the alleged 
³identity between the system of administration 
in the Party and that in an army.² 
Rafail is right when he says that mistakes must 
be corrected, that one must not persist in one¹s mistakes. 
And that is precisely why I do not lose hope that 
Rafail will, in the end, correct the mistakes he has made.

A P P E N D I C E S 
Appendix 1 
DECLARATION 
ON THE FORMATION OF THE UNION 
OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS 
Since the Soviet republics were formed, the states of the world 
have split into two camps: the camp of capitalism and the camp 
of socialism. 
There, in the camp of capitalism, we have national animosity 
and inequality, colonial slavery and chauvinism, national oppression 
and pogroms, imperialist brutalities and wars. 
Here, in the camp of socialism, we have mutual confidence 
and peace, national freedom and equality, the peaceful co-existence 
and fraternal co-operation of peoples. 
The attempts made by the capitalist world during the course 
of decades to solve the problem of nationalities by combining the 
free development of peoples with the system of exploitation of 
man by man have proved fruitless. On the contrary, the skein of 
national contradictions is becoming more and more entangled and 
is threatening the very existence of capitalism. The bourgeoisie 
has proved to be incapable of bringing about the co-operation of 
peoples. 
Only in the camp of the Soviets, only in the conditions of the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, which has rallied the majority of 
the population around itself, has it been possible to eradicate 
national oppression, to create an atmosphere of mutual confidence, 
and to lay the foundation for the fraternal co-operation of peoples. 
It was these circumstances alone that enabled the Soviet republics 
to repel the attacks of the imperialists of the whole world, 
home and foreign. 
It was these circumstances alone that enabled them to bring 
the Civil War to a successful conclusion, to preserve their existence 
and begin peaceful economic construction.

APPENDICES 404 
But the years of war have left their traces. Ruined fields, 
idle factories, shattered productive forces and exhausted economic 
resources left as a heritage by the war render inadequate the individual 
efforts of the individual republics to build up their economy. 
The restoration of the national economy has proved to be 
impossible while the republics continue to exist separately. 
On the other hand, the instability of the international situation 
and the danger of new attacks render inevitable the creation 
of a united front of the Soviet republics in face of the capitalist 
encirclement. 
Lastly, the very structure of Soviet power, which is international 
in its class nature, impels the toiling masses of the Soviet 
republics to unite into a single socialist family. 
All these circumstances imperatively demand the union of 
the Soviet republics into a single union state, capable of ensuring 
external security, internal economic progress and the unhampered 
national development of the peoples. 
The will of the peoples of the Soviet republics, who recently 
assembled at their Congresses of Soviets and unanimously resolved 
to form a ³Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,² is a reliable 
guarantee that this Union is a voluntary association of peoples 
enjoying equal rights, that each republic is guaranteed the right 
of freely seceding from the Union, that admission to the Union 
is open to all Socialist Soviet Republics, whether now existing 
or hereafter to arise, that the new union state will prove to be 
a worthy crown to the foundation for the peaceful co-existence 
and fraternal co-operation of the peoples that was laid in October 
1917, and that i t will serve as a sure bulwark against world 
capitalism and as a new and decisive step towards the union of 
the working people of all countries into a World Socialist Soviet 
Republic. 
Declaring all this before the whole world, and solemnly proclaiming 
the firmness of the foundations of Soviet power as expressed 
in the Constitutions of the Socialist Soviet Republics by whom 
we have been empowered, we, the delegates of these republics, 
acting in accordance with our mandates, have resolved to sign 
a treaty on the formation of a ³Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.²

1 The conference of Communists of the Tyurk peoples of the 
R.S.F.S.R., convened by the Central Committee of the 
R.C.P.(B.), took place in Moscow on January 1-2, 1921. It 
was attended by Party workers from Azerbaijan, Bashkiria, 
Turkestan, Tataria, Daghestan, the Terek Region, Kirghizia 
and the Crimea. It discussed the report of the Central Bureau 
of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East, and 
organisational and other questions. On January 2, J. V. Stalin 
delivered a report on the organisational question (no verbatim 
report was taken). On J. V. Stalin¹s report, the conference 
adopted ³Regulations Governing the Central Bureau for Work 
Among the Tyurk Peoples of the R.S.F.S.R.,² in conformity 
with which the Central Bureau of Communist Organisations 
of the Peoples of the East, which had existed since 1918, was 
transformed into the Central Bureau for Agitation and Propaganda 
Among the Tyurk Peoples of the R.S.F.S.R. p. 1

At this congress, J. V. Stalin delivered a speech on the military 
question (see Works, Vol. 4, pp. 258-59); and he was a member 
of the Military Commission set up by the congress to draft 
the resolution on this question. p. 3

at the Eighth Congress of Soviets, in the All-Russian Central 
Council of Trade Unions, and in the Moscow Gubernia Council of 
Trade Unions, that was held on December 30, 1920. p. 9 
5 The theses: ³The Immediate Tasks of the Party in the National 
Question² were discussed at a meeting of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) on February 
5 , 1921, and a commission headed by V. I . Lenin and 
J. V. Stalin was appointed to make the final draft. The theses 
were published in Pravda, No. 29, of February 10, 1921; they 
were also published as a separate pamphlet in the same year.

6 Pan-Islamism‹a reactionary religious and political ideology 
which arose in the second half of the XIX century in 
Sultan Turkey among the Turkish landlords, bourgeoisie, and 
clergy. Later on it spread among the propertied classes of the 
other Moslem peoples. Pan-Islamism professed the unification 
in one whole of all the peoples who worship Islam (Moslem 
religion). With the help of Pan-Islamism the ruling classes of 
the Moslem peoples were striving to strengthen their positions 
and to stifle the revolutionary movement of the toiling peoples 
of the East. 
The aim of Pan-Turkism is to subject all the Turkish peoples 
to Turkish rule. It arose during the Balkan wars of 1912-13. 
During the war of 1914-18 it developed into an extremely aggressive 
and chauvinistic ideology. In Russia, after the October 
Socialist Revolution, Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism were 
utilised by counter-revolutionary elements for the purpose 
of combating the Soviet power. 
Subsequently the Anglo-American imperialists utilised Pan- 
Islamism and Pan-Turkism as their agency in the preparation for

NOTES 413 
an imperialist war against the U.S.S.R. and the People¹s Democracies 
and for the purpose of suppressing the national liberation 
movement. p. 29 
7 The Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) was held on March 8-16, 
1921. It discussed the reports of the Central Committee and 
the Central Control Commission, and also reports on the trade 
unions and their role in the economic life of the country, on 
the tax in kind, on Party affairs, on the immediate tasks 
of the Party in the national question, on Party unity and the 
anarcho-syndicalist deviation, etc. The political report of the 
Central Committee, and the reports on the tax in kind, on 
Party unity, and on the anarcho-syndicalist deviation, were 
made by V. I. Lenin. The congress summed up the discussion 
that had taken place on the trade-union question and by an 
overwhelming majority endorsed Lenin¹s platform. In its 
resolution on ³Party Unity, ² drafted by V. I . Lenin, the 
congress condemned all the factional groups, ordered their 
immediate dissolution, and pointed out that Party unity was 
the fundamental condition for the success of the proletarian 
dictatorship. The congress adopted V. I. Lenin¹s resolution 
on ³The Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in Our Party,² 
which condemned the so-called ³Workers¹ Opposition² and 
declared that propaganda of the ideas of the anarcho-syndicalist 
deviation was incompatible with membership of the 
Communist Party. The Tenth Congress adopted a decision 
to pass from the produce surplus appropriation system to the 
tax in kind, to pass to the New Economic Policy. J. V. Stalin¹s 
report on ³The Immediate Tasks of the Party in the National 
Question² was heard on March 10. The congress unanimously 
adopted J. V. Stalin¹s theses on this question as a basis, and 
appointed a commission to elaborate them further. J. V. Stalin 
reported on the results of the commission¹s work at the evening 
session on March 15. The resolution that he proposed on behalf 
of the commission was unanimously adopted by the congress, 
which condemned the anti-Party deviations on the national 
question, i.e., dominant-nation (Great-Russian) chauvinism 
and local nationalism, as being harmful and dangerous to

NOTES 414 
communism and proletarian internationalism. The congress particularly 
condemned dominant-nation chauvinism as being the 
chief danger. (Concerning the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.)

8 The symposium entitled A Plan for the Electrification of the 
R.S.F.S.R. Report of the State Commission for the Electrification 
of Russia to the Eighth Congress of Soviets was published 
in December 1920 by the Scientific and Technical Department 
of the Supreme Council of National Economy. p. 50 
9 Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn (Economic Life)‹a daily newspaper, 
organ of the economic and financial People¹s Commissariats 
and institutions of the R.S.F.S.R. and U.S.S.R. (Supreme 
Council of National Economy, Council of Labour and Defence, 
State Planning Commission, State Bank, People¹s Commissariat 
of Finance, and others); it was published from November 
1918 to November 1937. p. 51 
10 The Two-and-a-Half International‹the ³International Association 
of Labour and Socialist Parties²‹was formed in 
Vienna in February 1921 at an inaugural conference of Centrist 
parties and groups which, owing to the pressure of the revolutionary-
minded workers, had temporarily seceded from the 
Second International. While criticising the Second International 
in words, the leaders of the Two-and-a-Half International 
(F. Adler, O. Bauer, L. Martov, and others) in fact pursued 
an opportunist policy on all the major questions of the proletarian 
movement, and strove to use the association to counteract 
the growing influence of the Communists among the 
masses of the workers. In 1923, the Two-and-a-Half International 
rejoined the Second International. p. 52 
11 The ³Council of Action and Propaganda of the Peoples of 
the East² was formed by decision of the First Congress of the

NOTES 415 
Peoples of the East, held in Baku in September 1920. The 
object of the council was to support and unite the liberation 
movement of the East. It existed for about a year. p. 56 
12 The First Congress of Working Women of the Highland Socialist 
Soviet Republic was held in Vladikavkaz on June 16-18, 
1921. There were present 152 women delegates: Chechens, 
Ossetians, Tatars, Kabardinians, Balkarians, etc., who came 
from remote highland villages. The congress discussed the 
following questions: the economic and legal position of women 
in the East before and after the revolution; the handicraft industries 
and the part played in them by the Highland women; 
public education and women of the East; mother and child 
welfare, etc. J. V. Stalin¹s telegram was read at the congress 
at the evening session of June 18. The congress sent a telegram 
of greetings to J. V. Stalin. p. 61 
13 The Autonomous Highland Socialist Soviet Republic was 
formed on the basis of a Decree of the All-Russian Central 
Executive Committee on January 20, 1921. Originally, the 
Highland A.S.S.R. consisted of the Chechen, Nazran, Vladikavkaz, 
Kabardinian, Balkarian and Karachayev territories. In 
the period 1921-24 a number of Autonomous National Regions 
were formed from the Highland A.S.S.R. By a Decree of 
the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on July 7, 1924, 
the Highland A.S.S.R. was dissolved. p. 61

14-22, 1917. It was convened by the Menshevik and Socialist-
Revolutionary leaders of the All-Russian Central Executive 
Committee of the Soviets of Workers¹ and Soldiers¹ Deputies 
and of the Executive Committee of the Soviets of Peasants¹ 
Deputies, and attended by representatives of the socialist 
parties, compromising Soviets, trade unions, Zemstvos, 
commercial and industrial circles and military units. The conference 
set up a Pre-parliament (The Provisional Council of 
the Republic) as an advisory body to the Provisional Government. 
With the assistance of the Pre-parliament the compromisers 
hoped to halt the revolution and to divert the country 
from the path of a Soviet revolution to the path of bourgeois 
constitutional development. p. 77

28 J. V. Stalin arrived in Tiflis at the end of June 1921 from 
Nalchik (where he had been taking a cure) to attend a plenary 
session of the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee of 
the R.C.P.(B.) held jointly with representatives of the local 
Party and trade-union organisations. The session, which lasted 
from July 2 to July 7, discussed important questions of political 
and economic affairs in the Transcaucasian Soviet 
Republics. In the resolution it adopted on the report on the 
political situation, drafted under J. V. Stalin¹s direction, the 
Plenum defined the tasks of the Transcaucasian Communists 
and struck a decisive blow at the nationalist deviators. The 
Plenum adopted a decision to set up a commission to unite 
the economic activities of the Transcaucasian Soviet Republics. 
It also discussed the following questions: the condition 
of the Transcaucasian railway; currency circulation 
in the Transcaucasian Soviet Republics; the autonomy of Nagorny 
Karabakh; Aj a r i a ; the situation in Abkhazia, et c . 
At a general meeting of the Tiflis Party organisation held on 
July 6, J. V. Stalin delivered a report on ³The Immediate Tasks 
of Communism in Georgia and Transcaucasia.² This report 
was published in the newspaper Pravda Gruzii, No. 108 of 
July 13, 1921, and in the same year was also published in pamphlet 
form by the Caucasian Bureau of the Central Committee 
of the R.C.P.(B.). p. 90 
29 Mussavatists‹the members of the ³Mussavat² Party, a nationalist 
party of the bourgeoisie and landlords in Azerbaijan, 
formed in 1912. In the period of the October Revolution and 
the Civil War it was the chief counter-revolutionary force 
in Azerbaijan. Supported by the Turkish, and later, by the

NOTES 418 
British interventionists, the Mussavatists were in power in 
Azerbaijan from September 1918 to April 1920, when the Mussavat 
government was overthrown by the joint efforts of the 
Baku workers and the Azerbaijanian peasants, and of the Red 
Army, which came to their assistance. p. 97 
30 Dashnaks‹the members of the ³Dashnaktsutyun² Party, 
an Armenian bourgeois-nationalist party, formed in the 1890¹s. 
In 1918-20, the Dashnaks headed the bourgeois-nationalist 
government of Armenia and transformed that country into 
a British interventionist base for fighting Soviet Russia. The 
Dashnak government was overthrown in November 1920 as 
a result of the struggle waged against it by the working people 
of Armenia, who were assisted by the Red Army. p. 97 
31 This refers to the military and political agreement concluded 
between Great Britain and France in 1904. It marked the beginning 
of the formation of the Entente, the imperialist 
alliance of Great Britain, France and tsarist Russia. p. 99

Moscow 1952, pp. 55-68). p. 103

35 This refers to the conference on the limitation of armaments 
and on Pacific and Far Eastern questions that took place in 
Washington from November 12, 1921 to February 6, 1922. 
The conference was attended by representatives of the United 
States, Great Britain and her Dominions, Japan, France, 
Italy, China, Belgium, Holland and Portugal. Soviet Russia

NOTES 419 
was not invited, notwithstanding the protest of the Soviet 
Government. The Washington Conference marked the culmination 
of the post-war re-division of the world, and was an 
attempt to establish a new correlation of imperialist forces 
in the Pacific. The agreements signed in Washington fixed 
the strength of the naval armaments of the imperialist powers 
and the latter¹s rights to islands in the Pacific and established 
the principle of the ³open door² in China, i.e., ³equal 
opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations 
throughout the territory of China.² Far from removing the contradictions 
among the imperialist powers, the Washington Conference 
intensified them. p. 121 
36 Zvezda (The Star)‹a legal Bolshevik newspaper published 
in St. Petersburg from December 16, 1910 to April 22, 1912, 
first weekly and later two or three times a week. It was under 
the ideological guidance of V. I. Lenin, who regularly sent 
articles for it from abroad. Regular contributors to the paper 
were V. M. Molotov; M. S. Olminsky, N. G. Poletayev, 
N. N. Baturin, K. S. Yeremeyev and others. Contributions 
were also received from Maxim Gorky. In the spring of 1912, 
when J. V. Stalin was in St. Petersburg, the paper came out 
under his direction, and he wrote a number of articles for it 
(see Works, Vol. 2, pp. 231-54). The circulation of individual 
issues of the paper reached 50,000 to 60,000. Zvezda paved 
the way for the publication of the Bolshevik daily Pravda. 
On April 22, 1912, the tsarist government suppressed Zvezda. 
It was succeeded by Nevskaya Zvezda, which continued publication 
until October 1912. p. 132 
37 Quoted from J. V. Stalin¹s article ³Our Aims,² published

39 The trial of the Socialist-Revolutionaries by the Supreme 
Revolutionary Tribunal took place in Moscow, in 1922, from 
June 8 to August 7. Of the 34 accused, 11 were members of the

NOTES 420 
Central Committee of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. 
The trial established that from the very first days of the October 
Socialist Revolution, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party 
had fought against the Soviet power, had organised armed 
revolts and conspiracies, had supported the foreign interventionists 
and had committed terroristic acts against leaders of 
the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet Government. p. 137 
40 This refers to the international economic conferences held 
in Genoa (April 10-May 19, 1922) and at The Hague (June 15- 
July 20, 1922). The Genoa Conference was called for the purpose 
of determining the relations between the capitalist world 
and Soviet Russia. The conference was attended, on the one 
side, by representatives of Great Britain, Frame, Italy, Japan 
and of other capitalist states, and, on the other side, by representatives 
of Soviet Russia. The representatives of the capitalist 
countries presented the Soviet delegation with demands 
which, if conceded, would have meant transforming the land 
of Soviets into a colony of West-European capital (the demand 
for payment of all war and pre-war debts, for restitution to 
foreigners of nationalised property formerly owned by them, 
etc.). The Soviet delegation rejected the claims of the foreign 
capitalists. The matter was referred to a conference of experts 
that was convened at The Hague. The Hague Conference also 
failed to reach agreement owing to the irreconcilability of the 
points of view of the two sides. p. 137 
41 J. V. Stalin headed the commission set up by the Plenum of the 
Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) on October 6, 1922, 
to draft the Bill for uniting the R.S.F.S.R., the Ukrainian 
S.S.R., the Transcaucasian Federation and the Byelorussian 
S.S.R. into a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This commission 
directed all the preparations for the First Congress 
of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. p. 141

1922, by the plenipotentiary representatives of the independent 
republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Byelo

russia, the Ukraine, Khorezm, Bukhara, the Far Eastern Republic 
and the R.S.F.S.R., authorising the R.S.F.S.R. 
to represent these republics at the European economic conference 
in Genoa. p. 143 
43 The Far Eastern Republic included the Pribaikal, the Transbaikal, 
the Amur Region, and the Maritime Province, Kamchatka, 
and the northern part of Sakhalin. It existed from April 1920 
to November 1922. p. 144 
44 The Transcaucasian Federation‹the Federative Union of 
Socialist Soviet Republics of Transcaucasia, was founded 
on March 12, 1922, at a plenipotentiary conference of representatives 
of the Central Executive Committees of Georgia, Azerbaijan 
and Armenia. In December 1922, the Federative Union 
was transformed into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative 
Soviet Republic (T.S.F.S.R.). The Transcaucasian Federation 
existed until 1936. In conformity with the Constitution of the 
U.S.S.R. adopted in 1936, the Armenian, Azerbaijanian and 
Georgian Soviet Socialist Republics entered the U.S.S.R. as 
Union Republics. (Concerning the Transcaucasian Federation, 
see this volume, pp. 231-36, 256-62.) p. 145 
45 The Bukhara and Khorezm People¹s Soviet Republics were 
formed in 1920 as a result of the successful people¹s insurrections 
in the former Khanates of Bukhara and Khiva. At the end 
of 1924 and beginning of 1925, as a result of the demarcation 
of states in Central Asia on a national basis, the territory 
of the Bukhara and Khorezm Republics became part of the 
newly formed Turkmenian and Uzbek Union Soviet Socialist 
Republics, the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic 
and the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Region. p. 145 
46 The Tenth All-Russian Congress of Soviets took place in Moscow 
on December 23-27, 1922. There were present 2,215 delegates, 
of whom 488 were delegates from the treaty republics‹the Transcaucasian 
S.F.S.R., the Ukrainian S.S.R. and the Byelorussian 
S.S.R.‹who had come to Moscow to attend the First

NOTES 422 
Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. and had been invited to 
attend the Tenth All-Russian Congress as guests of honour. 
The Tenth All-Russian Congress of Soviets discussed the following: 
report of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee 
and the Council of People¹s Commissars on the republic¹s 
home and foreign policy; report on the state of industry; report 
of the People¹s Commissariat of Agriculture (summary of 
work done to improve peasant farming); report of the People¹s 
Commissariat of Education; report of the People¹s Commissariat 
of Finance; proposal of the treaty Soviet republics on the 
creation of a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. On December 
26, J. V. Stalin delivered a report on uniting the Soviet 
republics. The resolution moved by him was adopted 
unanimously. After J. V. Stalin had delivered his report, the 
representatives of the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia 
and Byelorussia addressed the congress and on behalf of their 
respective peoples welcomed the union of the Soviet republics 
into a single union state‹the U.S.S.R. p. 148 
47 This refers to the negotiations of the Soviet Government with 
the British industrialist Urquhart for the conclusion of a concession 
agreement for the exploitation of mineral deposits in 
the Urals and in Kazakhstan. The draft agreement was rejected 
by the Council of People¹s Commissars on October 6, 1922, 
owing to the extortionate terms demanded by Urquhart, and 
also to the British Conservative Government¹s hostile policy towards 
Soviet Russia. The Soviet Government¹s refusal to conclude 
an agreement with Urquhart served the bourgeois press 
as a pretext for intensifying its anti-Soviet campaign. p. 151 
48 The Lausanne Conference (November 20, 1922 to July 24, 
1923) was called on the initiative of France, Great Britain 
and Italy to discuss the Near Eastern question (conclusion 
of a peace treaty between Greece and Turkey, delimitation 
of Turkey¹s frontiers, adoption of a convention governing the 
Straits, etc.). In addition to the above-mentioned countries, 
the following were represented: Japan, Rumania, Yugoslavia, 
Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey (representatives of the United

States were present as observers). Soviet Russia was invited 
to the conference only for the discussion of the question of the 
Straits (the Bosphorus, the Dardanelles). At the conference,

52 The Sverdlov University‹the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Communist 
University named after Y. M. Sverdlov. 
In 1918, on the initiative of Y. M. Sverdlov, the All-Russian 
Central Executive Committee organised short-term courses 
for agitators and propagandists. In January 1919, these courses 
were renamed the School for Soviet Work. By a decision adopted 
at the Eighth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.), the school was 
made the basis for setting up the Central School for Soviet and 
Party Work. In the latter half of 1919 this school was transformed 
into the Sverdlov Workers¹ and Peasants! Communist 
University. p. 163

54 During the mass political demonstration in Petrograd on April 
20-21, 1917, a group of members of the Petrograd Committee 
of the Bolshevik Party (Bagdatyev and others), despite the Central 
Committee¹s instructions that the demonstration was to 
be a peaceful one, put forward the slogan of the immediate overthrow 
of the Provisional Government. The Central Committee 
condemned the action of these ³Left² adventurers (see

Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers¹ 
and Soldiers¹ Deputies on March 7, 1917, for the purpose 
of establishing contact with the Provisional Government, of 
³influencing² it and of ³supervising² its activities. Actually, 
the ³Contact Committee² helped to carry out the Provisional 
Government¹s bourgeois policy and tried to restrain the masses 
of the workers from waging a revolutionary struggle to transfer 
all power to the Soviets. The ³Contact Committee² existed 
until May 1917, when representatives of the Mensheviks and 
Socialist-Revolutionaries actually entered the Provisional 
Government. p. 179

they were published in Pravda, No. 65. p. 184 
59 Smyena Vekh (Change of Landmarks)‹a bourgeois political 
trend that arose in 1921 among the Russian whiteguard émigrés 
abroad. It was headed by a group consisting of N. Ustryalov, 
Y. Kluchnikov, and others, who published the magazine Smyena 
Vekh (at first a symposium was published with this title): The 
Smyena-Vekhist ideology expressed the views of that section 
of the bourgeoisie which had abandoned the open armed struggle 
against the Soviet Government. They considered that with 
the adoption of the New Economic Policy the Soviet system 
would gradually change into bourgeois democracy. p. 190

61 The Twelfth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) was held on April 
17-25, 1923. This was the first congress since the October Socialist 
Revolution that V. I. Lenin was unable to attend. The congress 
discussed the reports of the Central Committee, of the 
Central Control Commission and of the Russian delegation in the 
Executive Committee of the Comintern, and also reports on: 
industry, national factors in Party and state affairs 
taxation policy in the countryside, delimitation of administrative 
areas, etc. In its decisions the congress took into account 
all the directives given by V. I. Lenin in his last articles and 
letters. The congress summed up the results of the two years 
of the New Economic Policy and gave a determined rebuff 
to Trotsky, Bukharin and their adherents, who interpreted the 
N.E.P. as a retreat from the socialist position. The congress devoted 
great attention to the organisational and national questions. 
At the evening sitting on April 17, J. V. Stalin delivered the 
Central Committee¹s organisational report. In the resolution it 
adopted on this report, the congress endorsed Lenin¹s plan for 
the reorganisation of the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Inspection 
and the Central Control Commission, and noted an improvement 
in the organisational apparatus of the Central Committee and in 
all organisational activities. J. V. Stalin¹s report on ³National 
Factors in Party and State Affairs² was heard on April 23. 
The debate on this report continued during April 23 and 24, and 
further discussion was referred to the committee on the national 
question that was set up by the congress, and which conducted 
its proceedings under the direct guidance of J. V. Stalin. On 
April 25, the congress passed the resolution submitted by the 
committee. This resolution was based on J. V. Stalin¹s theses. The 
congress exposed the nationalist deviators and called on the 
Party resolutely to combat the deviations on the national 
question‹Great-Russian chauvinism and local bourgeois 
nationalism. (Concerning the Twelfth Congress of the 
R.C.P.(B.), see History of the C.P.S.U.(B.), Short Course,
