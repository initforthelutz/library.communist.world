PREFACE AND POSTSCRIPT 
TO RURAL SURVEYS 
March and April 1941
PREFACE 
March 17, 1941
The present rural policy of the Party is not one of Agrarian Revolution 
as during the ten years' civil war, but is a rural policy for the 
National United Front Against Japan. The whole Party should carry 
out the Central Committee's directives of July 7 and December 25, 
1940,1 and the directives of the forthcoming Seventh National Congress. 
The following material is being published to help comrades 
find a method for studying problems. Many of our comrades still 
have a crude and careless style of work, do not seek to understand 
things thoroughly and may even be completely ignorant of conditions 
at the lower levels, and yet they are responsible for directing work. 
This is an extremely dangerous state of affairs. Without a really 
concrete knowledge of the actual conditions of the classes in Chinese 
society there can be no really good leadership. 
The only way to know conditions is to make social investigations, 
to investigate the conditions of each social class in real life. For 
those charged with directing work, the basic method for knowing 
conditions is to concentrate on a few cities and villages according 
to a plan, use the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, i.e., the method 
of class analysis, and make a number of thorough investigations. 
Only thus can we acquire even the most rudimentary knowledge of 
China's social problems. 
To do this, first, direct your eyes downward, do not hold your 
head high and gaze at the sky. Unless a person is interested in turning 
his eyes downward and is determined to do so, he will never in his 
whole life really understand things in China. 
11

12 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Second, hold fact-finding meetings. Certainly, no all-round knowledge 
can be acquired merely by glancing this way and that and 
listening to hearsay. Of the data I obtained through fact-finding 
meetings, those on Hunan Province and on Chingkangshan have been 
lost. The materials published here consist mainly of the ³Survey of 
Hsingkuo², the ³Survey of Changkang Township² and the ³Survey of 
Tsaihsi Township². Holding fact-finding meetings is the simplest, most 
practicable and most reliable method, from which I have derived 
much benefit; it is a better school than any university. Those attending 
such meetings should be really experienced cadres of middle and 
lower ranks, or ordinary people. In my investigations of five counties 
in Hunan Province and two counties in Chingkangshan, I approached 
responsible cadres of middle rank; in the Hsunwu investigation I 
approached cadres of the middle and lower ranks, a poor hsiutsai,2 
a bankrupt ex-president of the chamber of commerce and a petty 
official in charge of county revenue who had lost his job. All of these 
people gave me a great deal of information I had never even heard 
of. The man who for the first time gave me a complete picture of the 
rottenness of Chinese jails was a petty jailer I met during my investigation 
in Hengshan County, Hunan. In my investigations of Hsingkuo 
County and Changkang and Tsaihsi townships, I approached 
comrades working at the township level and ordinary peasants. These 
cadres, the peasants, the hsiutsei, the jailer, the merchant and the 
revenue clerk were all my esteemed teachers, and as their pupil I 
had to be respectful and diligent and comradely in my attitude; 
otherwise they would have paid no attention to me, and, though they 
knew, would not have spoken or, if they spoke, would not have told 
all they knew. A fact-finding meeting need not be large; from three 
to five or seven or eight people are enough. Ample time must be 
allowed and an outline for the investigation must be prepared; 
furthermore, one must personally ask questions, take notes and have 
discussions with those at the meeting. Therefore one certainly cannot 
make an investigation, or do it well, without zeal, a determination 
to direct one's eyes downward and a thirst for knowledge, and without 
shedding the ugly mantle of pretentiousness and becoming a 
willing pupil. It has to be understood that the masses are the real 
heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, and without 
this understanding it is impossible to acquire even the most 
rudimentary knowledge.

13 PREFACE AND POSTFACE TO RURAL SURVEYS 
I should like to repeat that the main purpose of publishing this 
reference material is to indicate a method for finding out the conditions 
prevailing at the lower levels; it is not to have comrades 
memorize the specific material and the conclusions drawn from it. 
Speaking generally, the infant bourgeoisie of China has not been 
able, and never will be able, to provide relatively comprehensive 
or even rudimentary material on social conditions, as the bourgeoisie 
in Europe, America and Japan has done; we have therefore no 
alternative but to collect it ourselves. Speaking specifically, people 
engaged in practical work must at all times keep abreast of changing 
conditions, and this is something for which no Communist Party in 
any country can depend on others. Therefore, everyone engaged in 
practical work must investigate conditions at the lower levels. Such 
investigation is especially necessary for those who know theory but 
do not know the actual conditions, for otherwise they will not be 
able to link theory with practice. Although my assertion, ³No investigation, 
no right to speak², has been ridiculed as ³narrow empiricism², 
to this day I do not regret having made it; what is more, I still insist 
that without investigation there cannot possibly be any right to speak. 
There are many people who ³the moment they alight from the official 
carriage² make a hullabaloo, spout opinions, criticize this and condemn 
that; but, in fact, ten out of ten of them will meet with failure. 
For such views or criticisms, which are not based on thorough 
investigation, are nothing but ignorant twaddle. Countless times our 
Party suffered at the hands of these ³imperial envoys², who rushed 
here, there and everywhere. Stalin rightly says that ³theory becomes 
purposeless if it is not connected with revolutionary practice². And he 
rightly adds that ³practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined 
by revolutionary theory².3 Nobody should be labelled a ³narrow 
empiricist² except the ³practical man² who gropes in the dark and 
lacks perspective and foresight. 
Today I still feel keenly the necessity for thorough research into 
Chinese and world affairs; this is related to the scantiness of my 
own knowledge of Chinese and world affairs and does not imply 
that I know everything and that others are ignorant. It is my wish 
to go on being a pupil, learning from the masses, together with all 
other Party comrades.

POSTSCRIPT 
April 19, 1941
The experience of the period of the ten years¹ civil war is the 
best and most pertinent for the present period, the War of Resistance 
Against Japan. This refers to the aspect of how to link ourselves 
with the masses and mobilize them against the enemy, but not to the 
aspect of the tactical line. The Party's present tactical line is different 
in principle from that of the past. Formerly, the Party¹s tactical line 
was to oppose the landlords and the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie; 
now, it is to unite with all those landlords and members of 
the bourgeoisie who are not against resisting Japan. Even in the 
latter stage of the ten years¹ civil war, it was incorrect not to have 
adopted differing policies towards the reactionary government and 
political party which were launching armed attacks on us on the 
one hand, and towards all the social strata of a capitalist character 
under our own rule on the other; it was also incorrect not to have 
adopted differing policies towards the different groups within the 
reactionary government and political party. At that time, a policy 
of ³all struggle² was pursued towards every section of society other 
than the peasantry and the lower strata of the urban petty bourgeoisie, 
and this policy was undoubtedly wrong. In agrarian policy, 
it was also wrong to repudiate the correct policy adopted in the early 
and middle periods of the ten years¹ civil war,4 whereby the landlords 
were given the same allotment of land as the peasants so that 
they could engage in farming and would not become displaced or 
go up into the mountains as bandits and disrupt public order. The 
Party's policy is now of necessity a different one; it is not ³all struggle 
and no alliance², neither is it ³all alliance and no struggle² (like the 
Chen Tu-hsiuism of 1927). Instead, it is a policy of uniting with all 
social strata opposed to Japanese imperialism, of forming a united 
front with and yet of waging struggles against them, struggles that 
differ in form according to the different degrees in which their 
vacillating or reactionary side manifests itself in capitulation to the 
enemy and opposition to the Communist Party and the people. The 
present policy is a dual policy which synthesizes ³alliance² and 
³struggle². In labour policy, it is the dual policy of suitably improving 
the workers' livelihood and of not hampering the proper development 
of the capitalist economy. In agrarian policy, it is the dual

15 PREFACE AND POSTFACE TO RURAL SURVEYS 
policy of requiring the landlords to reduce rent and interest and of 
stipulating that the peasants should pay this reduced rent and interest. 
In the sphere of political rights, it is the dual policy of allowing all 
the anti-Japanese landlords and capitalists the same rights of person 
and the same political and property rights as the workers and peasants 
and yet of guarding against possible counter-revolutionary activity 
on their part. State-owned and co-operative economy should be 
developed, but the main economic sector in the rural base areas today 
consists not of state but of private enterprises, and the sector of 
non-monopoly capitalism in our economy should be given the opportunity 
to develop and be used against Japanese imperialism and 
the semi-feudal system. This is the most revolutionary policy for 
China today, and to oppose or impede its execution is undoubtedly 
a mistake. To preserve the communist purity of Party members 
scrupulously and resolutely, and to protect the useful part of the 
capitalist sector of the social economy and enable it to develop appropriately, 
are both indispensable tasks for us in the period of 
resisting Japan and building a democratic republic. In this period it 
is possible that some Communists may be corrupted by the bourgeoisie 
and that capitalist ideas may emerge among members of the 
Party, and we must fight against these decadent ideas; however, we 
should not mistakenly carry over the struggle against capitalist ideas 
within the Party to the field of social economy and oppose the 
capitalist sector of the economy. We must draw a clear line of 
demarcation between the two. The Communist Party of China is 
working in a complicated environment, and every Party member, 
and especially every cadre, must temper himself to become a fighter 
who understands Marxist tactics. A one-sided and over-simplified 
approach to problems can never lead the revolution to victory.

4 The first period of the ten years¹ civil war lasted from late 1927 to late 
1928 and is generally known as the Chingkangshan period; the middle period ran 
from early 1929 to the autumn of 1931, that is, from the establishment of the Central 
Red Base Area to the victorious conclusion of the campaign against the third 
³encirclement and suppression²; and the third period from late 1931 to late 1934, 
that is, from the victorious conclusion of that campaign to the enlarged meeting of 
the Political Bureau at Tsunyi in Kweichow Province called by the Central Committee 
of the Party. The Tsunyi Meeting of January 1935 put an end to the domination of 
the ³Left² opportunist line in the Party, which had lasted from 1931 to 1934, and 
steered the Party back to the correct line.

REFORM OUR STUDY 
May 1941
I propose that we should reform the method and the system 
of study throughout the Party. The reasons are as follows: 
I 
The twenty years of the Communist Party of China have been 
twenty years in which the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism has 
become more and more integrated with the concrete practice of the 
Chinese revolution. If we recall how superficial and meagre our understanding 
of Marxism-Leninism and of the Chinese revolution was 
during our Party¹s infancy, we can see how much deeper and richer 
it is now. For a hundred years, the finest sons and daughters of the 
disaster-ridden Chinese nation fought and sacrificed their lives, one 
stepping into the breach as another fell, in quest of the truth that 
would save the country and the people. This moves us to song and 
tears. But it was only after World War I and the October Revolution 
in Russia that we found Marxism-Leninism, the best of truths, the 
best of weapons for liberating our nation. And the Communist Party 
of China has been the initiator, propagandist and organizer in the 
wielding of this weapon. As soon as it was linked with the concrete 
practice of the Chinese revolution, the universal truth of Marxism- 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung made this report to a cadres¹ meeting in Yenan The 
report and the two articles, ³Rectify the Party¹s Style of Work² and ³Oppose 
Stereotyped Party Writing², are Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s basic works on the rectification 
movement In these he summed up, on the ideological plane, past differences 
in the Party over the Party line and analysed the petty-bourgeois ideology and style 
which, masquerading as Marxism-Leninism, were prevalent in the Party, and which 
chiefly manifested themselves in subjectivist and sectarian tendencies, their form 
17

18 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Leninism gave an entirely new complexion to the Chinese revolution. 
Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party, 
basing itself on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, has taken 
a further step in its study of the concrete practice of this war and 
in its study of China and the world today, and has also made a 
beginning in the study of Chinese history. These are all very 
good signs. 
II 
However, we still have shortcomings, and very big ones too. 
Unless we correct these shortcomings, we shall not, in my opinion, 
be able to take another step forward in our work and in our great 
cause of integrating the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with 
the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. 
First, take the study of current conditions. We have achieved 
some success in our study of present domestic and international conditions, 
but for such a large political party as ours, the material we 
have collected is fragmentary and our research work unsystematic 
on each and every aspect of these subjects, whether it be the political, 
military, economic or cultural aspect. Generally speaking, in the last 
twenty years we have not done systematic and thorough work in 
collecting and studying material on these aspects, and we are lacking 
in a climate of investigation and study of objective reality. To behave 
like ³a blindfolded man catching sparrows², or ³a blind man groping 
for fish², to be crude and careless, to indulge in verbiage, to rest 
content with a smattering of knowledge  such is the extremely bad 
style of work that still exists among many comrades in our Party, 
a style utterly opposed to the fundamental spirit of Marxism- 
Leninism. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have taught us that it is 
necessary to study conditions conscientiously and to proceed from 
objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of our 
comrades act in direct violation of this truth. 
of expression being stereotyped Party writing. Comrade Mao Tse-tung called for a 
Patty-wide movement of Marxist-Leninist education to rectify style of work in 
accordance with the ideological principle of Marxism-Leninism. His call very quickly 
led to a great debate between proletarian and petty-bourgeois ideology inside and 
outside the Party. This consolidated the position of proletarian ideology inside and 
outside the Party, enabled the broad ranks of cadres to take a great step forward 
ideologically and the Party to achieve unprecedented unity.

19 REFORM OUR STUDY 
Second, take the study of history. Although a few Party members 
and sympathizers have undertaken this work, it has not been done 
in an organized way. Many Party members are still in a fog about 
Chinese history, whether of the last hundred years or of ancient 
times. There are many Marxist-Leninist scholars who cannot open 
their mouths without citing ancient Greece; but as for their own 
ancestors  sorry, they have been forgotten. There is no climate 
of serious study either of current conditions or of past history. 
Third, take the study of international revolutionary experience, 
the study of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Many comrades 
seem to study Marxism-Leninism not to meet the needs of 
revolutionary practice, but purely for the sake of study. Consequently, 
though they read, they cannot digest. They can only cite odd quotations 
from Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin in a one-sided manner, 
but are unable to apply the stand, viewpoint and method of Marx, 
Engels, Lenin and Stalin to the concrete study of China¹s present 
conditions and her history or to the concrete analysis and solution 
of the problems of the Chinese revolution. Such an attitude towards 
Marxism-Leninism does a great deal of harm, particularly among 
cadres of the middle and higher ranks. 
The three aspects I have just mentioned, neglect of the study of 
current conditions, neglect of the study of history and neglect of 
the application of Marxism-Leninism, all constitute an extremely bad 
style of work. Its spread has harmed many of our comrades. 
There are indeed many comrades in our ranks who have been 
led astray by this style of work. Unwilling to carry on systematic and 
thorough investigation and study of the specific conditions inside 
and outside the country, the province, county or district, they issue 
orders on no other basis than their scanty knowledge and ³It must be 
so because it seems so to me². Does not this subjectivist style still 
exist among a great many comrades? 
There are some who are proud, instead of ashamed, of knowing 
nothing or very little of our own history. What is particularly significant 
is that very few really know the history of the Communist Party of 
China and the history of China in the hundred years since the Opium 
War. Hardly anyone has seriously taken up the study of the economic, 
political, military and cultural history of the last hundred years. 
Ignorant of their own country, some people can only relate tales of 
ancient Greece and other foreign lands, and even this knowledge is 
quite pathetic, consisting of odds and ends from old foreign books.

20 MAO TSE-TUNG 
For several decades, many of the returned students from abroad 
have suffered from this malady. Coming home from Europe, America 
or Japan, they can only parrot things foreign. They become gramophones 
and forget their duty to understand and create new things. 
This malady has also infected the Communist Party. 
Although we are studying Marxism, the way many of our people 
study it runs directly counter to Marxism. That is to say, they violate 
the fundamental principle earnestly enjoined on us by Marx, Engels, 
Lenin and Stalin, the unity of theory and practice. Having violated 
this principle, they invent an opposite principle of their own, the 
separation of theory from practice. In the schools and in the education 
of cadres at work, teachers of philosophy do not guide students to 
study the logic of the Chinese revolution; teachers of economics do 
not guide them to study the characteristics of the Chinese economy; 
teachers of political science do not guide them to study the tactics 
of the Chinese revolution; teachers of military science do not guide 
them to study the strategy and tactics adapted to China¹s special 
features; and so on and so forth. Consequently, error is disseminated, 
doing people great harm. A person does not know how to apply in 
Fuhsien1 what he has learned in Yenan. Professors of economics 
cannot explain the relationship between the Border Region currency 
and the Kuomintang currency,2 so naturally the students cannot explain 
it either. Thus a perverse mentality has been created among 
many students; instead of showing an interest in China¹s problems 
and taking the Party¹s directives seriously, they give all their hearts 
to the supposedly eternal and immutable dogmas learned from 
their teachers. 
Of course, what I have just said refers to the worst type in our 
Party, and I am not saying that it is the general case. However, 
people of this type do exist; what is more, there are quite a few 
of them and they cause a great deal of harm. This matter should not 
be treated lightly. 
III 
In order to explain this idea further, I should like to contrast 
two opposite attitudes. 
First, there is the subjectivist attitude.

21 REFORM OUR STUDY 
With this attitude, a person does not make a systematic and 
thorough study of the environment, but works by sheer subjective 
enthusiasm and has a blurred picture of the face of China today. 
With this attitude, he chops up history, knows only ancient Greece 
but not China and is in a fog about the China of yesterday and the 
day before yesterday. With this attitude, a person studies Marxist- 
Leninist theory in the abstract and without any aim. He goes to Marx, 
Engels, Lenin and Stalin not to seek the stand, viewpoint and method 
with which to solve the theoretical and tactical problems of the 
Chinese revolution but to study theory purely for theory¹s sake. He 
does not shoot the arrow at the target but shoots at random. Marx, 
Engels, Lenin and Stalin have taught us that we should proceed 
from objective realities and that we should derive laws from them 
to serve as our guide to action. For this purpose, we should, as 
Marx has said, appropriate the material in detail and subject it 
to scientific analysis and synthesis.3 Many of our people do not 
act in this way but do the opposite. A good number of them are 
doing research work but have no interest in studying either the China 
of today or the China of yesterday and confine their interest to the 
study of empty ³theories² divorced from reality. Many others are 
doing practical work, but they too pay no attention to the study of 
objective conditions, often rely on sheer enthusiasm and substitute 
their personal feelings for policy. Both kinds of people, relying on 
the subjective, ignore the existence of objective realities. When 
making speeches, they indulge in a long string of headings, A, B, C, D, 
1, 2, 3, 4, and when writing articles, they turn out a lot of verbiage. 
They have no intention of seeking truth from facts, but only a desire 
to curry favour by claptrap. They are flashy without substance, brittle 
without solidity. They are always right, they are the Number One 
authority under Heaven, ³imperial envoys² who rush everywhere. 
Such is the style of work of some comrades in our ranks. To govern 
one¹s own conduct by this style is to harm oneself, to teach it to 
others is to harm others, and to use it to direct the revolution is to 
harm the revolution. To sum up, this subjectivist method which is 
contrary to science and Marxism-Leninism is a formidable enemy 
of the Communist Party, the working class, the people and the nation; 
it is a manifestation of impurity in Party spirit. A formidable enemy 
stands before us, and we must overthrow him. Only when subjectivism 
is overthrown can the truth of Marxism-Leninism prevail, can Party 
spirit be strengthened, can the revolution be victorious. We must

22 MAO TSE-TUNG 
assert that the absence of a scientific attitude, that is, the absence 
of the Marxist-Leninist approach of uniting theory and practice, 
means that Party spirit is either absent or deficient. 
There is a couplet which portrays this type of person. It runs: 
The reed growing on the wall  top-heavy, thin-stemmed and 
shallow of root; 
The bamboo shoot in the hills  sharp-tongued, thick-skinned 
and hollow inside. 
Is this not an apt description of those who do not have a scientific 
attitude, who can only recite words and phrases from the works of 
Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin and who enjoy a reputation unwarranted 
by any real learning? If anyone really wishes to cure himself 
of his malady, I advise him to commit this couplet to memory 
or to show still more courage and paste it on the wall of his room. 
Marxism-Leninism is a science, and science means honest, solid 
knowledge; there is no room for playing tricks. Let us, then, be honest. 
Secondly, there is the Marxist-Leninist attitude. 
With this attitude, a person applies the theory and method of 
Marxism-Leninism to the systematic and thorough investigation and 
study of the environment. He does not work by enthusiasm alone 
but, as Stalin says, combines revolutionary sweep with practicalness.4 
With this attitude he will not chop up history. It is not enough for 
him to know ancient Greece, he must know China; he must know 
the revolutionary history not only of foreign countries but also of 
China, not only the China of today but also the China of yesterday 
and of the day before yesterday. With this attitude, one studies the 
theory of Marxism-Leninism with a purpose, that is, to integrate 
Marxist-Leninist theory with the actual movement of the Chinese 
revolution and to seek from this theory the stand, viewpoint and 
method with which to solve the theoretical and tactical problems of 
the Chinese revolution. Such an attitude is one of shooting the arrow 
at the target. The ³target² is the Chinese revolution, the ³arrow² is 
Marxism-Leninism. We Chinese Communists have been seeking this 
arrow because we want to hit the target of the Chinese revolution 
and of the revolution of the East. To take such an attitude is to seek 
truth from facts. ³Facts² are all the things that exist objectively, 
³truth² means their internal relations, that is, the laws governing 
them, and ³to seek² means to study. We should proceed from the 
actual conditions inside and outside the country, the province, county

23 REFORM OUR STUDY 
or district, and derive from them, as our guide to action, laws which 
are inherent in them and not imaginary, that is, we should find the 
internal relations of the events occurring around us. And in order 
to do that we must rely not on subjective imagination, not on momentary 
enthusiasm, not on lifeless books, but on facts that exist 
objectively; we must appropriate the material in detail and, guided 
by the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, draw correct conclusions 
from it. Such conclusions are not mere lists of phenomena in 
A, B, C, D order or writings full of platitudes, but are scientific 
conclusions. Such an attitude is one of seeking truth from facts and 
not of currying favour by claptrap. It is the manifestation of Party 
spirit, the Marxist-Leninist style of uniting theory and practice. It 
is the attitude every Communist Party member should have at the 
very least. He who adopts this attitude will be neither ³top-heavy, 
thin-stemmed and shallow of root² nor ³sharp-tongued, thick-skinned 
and hollow inside². 
IV 
In accordance with the above views, I would like to make the 
following proposals: 
1. We should place before the whole Party the task of making 
a systematic and thorough study of the situation around us. On the 
basis of the theory and method of Marxism-Leninism, we should 
make a detailed investigation and study of developments in the 
economic, financial, political, military, cultural and party activities of 
our enemies, our friends and ourselves, and then draw the proper 
and necessary conclusions. To this end, we should direct our comrades¹ 
attention to the investigation and study of these practical matters. 
We should get our comrades to understand that the twofold 
basic task of the leading bodies of the Communist Party is to know 
conditions and to master policy; the former means knowing the world 
and the latter changing the world. We should get our comrades to 
understand that without investigation there is no right to speak, and 
that bombastic twaddle and a mere list of phenomena in 1, 2, 3, 4 
order are of no use. Take propaganda work, for instance; if we do 
not know the situation with regard to the propaganda of our enemies, 
our friends and ourselves, we shall be unable to decide on a correct

24 MAO TSE-TUNG 
propaganda policy. In the work of any department, it is necessary 
to know the situation first and only then can the work be well handled. 
The fundamental link in changing the Party¹s style of work is to 
carry out plans for investigation and study throughout the Party. 
2. As for China¹s history in the last hundred years, we should 
assemble qualified persons to study it, in co-operation and with a 
proper division of labour, and so overcome the present disorganized 
state of affairs. First it is necessary to make analytical studies in the 
several fields of economic history, political history, military history 
and cultural history, and only then will it be possible to make 
synthetical studies. 
3. As for education for cadres whether at work or in schools for 
cadres, a policy should be established of focusing such education on 
the study of the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and 
using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and 
the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation 
should be discarded. Moreover, in studying Marxism-Leninism, we 
should use the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
(Bolsheviks), Short Course as the principal material. It is the best 
synthesis and summing-up of the world communist movement of 
the past hundred years, a model of the integration of theory and 
practice, and so far the only comprehensive model in the whole world. 
When we see how Lenin and Stalin integrated the universal truth of 
Marxism with the concrete practice of the Soviet revolution and 
thereby developed Marxism, we shall know how we should work 
in China. 
We have made many detours. But error is often the precursor 
of what is correct. I am confident that in the context of the Chinese 
revolution and the world revolution, which is so intensely alive and 
so richly varied, this reform of our study will certainly yield good 
results.

EXPOSE THE PLOT 
FOR A FAR EASTERN MUNICH 
May 25, 1941
1. A compromise between Japan and the United States at the 
expense of China and the creation of an Eastern Munich against 
communism and against the Soviet Union  such is the new plot 
which is now being hatched by Japan, the United States and Chiang 
Kai-shek. We must expose this plot and fight it. 
2. Now that the Japanese imperialists have ended their latest 
round of military attacks, which was designed to force Chiang 
Kai-shek to capitulate, there are bound to be moves to induce him 
to capitulate. This is a repeat performance of the enemy¹s old policy 
of using the stick and the carrot, either alternately or simultaneously. 
We must expose this policy and fight it. 
3. Simultaneously with her military attacks, Japan has launched 
a rumour-mongering campaign alleging that ³the Eighth Route Army 
does not want to fight in co-ordination with the Kuomintang Central 
Army², that ³the Eighth Route Army is seizing every opportunity 
to expand its territory², that ³it is opening up an international route², 
that ³it is setting up another Central Government², etc. This is a 
cunning Japanese scheme to foment discord between the Kuomintang 
and the Communist Party and thus to make it easier for them 
to induce the Kuomintang to capitulate. The Kuomintang Central 
News Agency and the Kuomintang press are copying and spreading 
these rumours, showing no qualms about echoing Japan¹s anti- 
Communist propaganda, and their intentions are most dubious. This, 
too, we must expose and fight. 
4. Although the New Fourth Army has been declared to be 
³in rebellion² and the Eighth Route Army has not received a single

bullet or a single copper from the Kuomintang, they have never for 
a moment ceased fighting the enemy. The Eighth Route Army, moreover, 
has taken the initiative in co-ordinating its operations with those 
of the Kuomintang troops in the fighting in the present campaign in 
southern Shansi,1 and for the last two weeks it has been launching 
attacks on all fronts in northern China, where fierce battles are raging 
at this very moment. The armed forces and the people led by the 
Communist Party have already become the mainstay in the War of 
Resistance Against Japan. All the calumnies against the Communist 
Party are aimed at sabotaging the War of Resistance and paving the 
way for capitulation. We should extend the military successes of the 
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and oppose all the defeatists 
and capitulationists. 
NOTES 
1 The Southern Shansi campaign refers to the campaign of the Chungtiao 
Mountains. In May 1941, a Japanese invading force 50,000 strong attacked the 
Chungtiao Mountains area to the north of the Yellow River in southern Shansi. 
Altogether seven Kuomintang corps were massed in that area, and another four 
in the Kaoping area to the northeast, making a total of 250,000 men. Since the 
fight against the Communists was the main job of the Kuomintang troops north of 
the Yellow River, they had never prepared themselves to fight the Japanese, and 
most of them tried to avoid combat when the Japanese aggressors attacked. Therefore, 
in spite of vigorous efforts-by the Eighth Route Army to support the Kuomintang 
troops against the enemy in this campaign, the Kuomintang troops were completely 
routed, losing more than 50,000 men in three weeks, while the remainder fled to 
the south of the Yellow River.

ON THE INTERNATIONAL UNITED FRONT 
AGAINST FASCISM 
June 23, 1941
On June 22 the fascist rulers of Germany attacked the Soviet 
Union. This is a perfidious crime of aggression not only against the 
Soviet Union but against the freedom and independence of all nations. 
The Soviet Union¹s sacred war of resistance against fascist 
aggression is being waged not only in its own defence but in defence 
of all the nations struggling to liberate themselves from fascist 
enslavement. 
For Communists throughout the world the task now is to mobilize 
the people of all countries and organize an international united front 
to fight fascism and defend the Soviet Union, defend China, and 
defend the freedom and independence of all nations. In the present 
period, every effort must be concentrated on combating fascist 
enslavement. 
For the Chinese Communist Party the tasks throughout the country 
are as follows: 
1. Persevere in the National United Front Against Japan, persevere 
in Kuomintang-Communist co-operation, drive the Japanese 
imperialists out of China, and by these means assist the Soviet 
Union. 
2. Resolutely combat all the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist 
activities of the reactionaries among the big bourgeoisie. 
3. In foreign relations, unite against the common foe with everybody 
in Britain, the United States and other countries who is opposed 
to the fascist rulers of Germany, Italy and Japan. 
This inner-Party directive was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

SPEECH AT 
THE ASSEMBLY OF REPRESENTATIVES 
OF THE SHENSI-KANSU-NINGSIA 
BORDER REGION 
November 21, 1941
Members of the Assembly! Comrades! Today¹s inauguration of 
the Border Region Assembly of Representatives is of great significance. 
The Assembly has but one objective, the overthrow of Japanese 
imperialism and the building of a China of New Democracy 
or, in other words, a China of the revolutionary Three People¹s 
Principles. In the China of today there can be no other objective. 
For our chief enemies now are not domestic, but are the Japanese 
fascists and the German and Italian fascists. At this moment the 
Soviet Red Army is fighting for the destiny of the Soviet Union and 
of the whole of mankind, and we, for our part, are combating Japanese 
imperialism. Japanese imperialism is continuing its aggression 
with the purpose of subjugating China. The Communist Party of 
China stands for uniting all the anti-Japanese forces throughout the 
country to overthrow Japanese imperialism, and for co-operating 
with all anti-Japanese parties, classes and nationalities; everyone, 
excepting traitors, must unite in the common struggle. This has been 
the consistent stand of the Communist Party. For more than four 
years the Chinese people have been heroically waging the War of 
Resistance, a war that has been maintained through the co-operation 
of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and of all classes, 
parties and nationalities. But it is not yet won, and to win it we have 
to fight on and ensure that the revolutionary Three People¹s Principles 
are put into effect. 
Why must we put the revolutionary Three People¹s Principles 
into effect? Because up to the present time Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s revolutionary 
Three People¹s Principles have not been translated into reality 
31

32 MAO TSE-TUNG 
in all parts of China. Why don¹t we demand that socialism be put 
into effect now? Of course socialism is a superior system and has 
long been in operation in the Soviet Union, but in China today the 
conditions for it are still lacking. It is the revolutionary Three People¹s 
Principles that have been put into effect in our Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia 
Border Region. We have not gone beyond them in solving any of our 
practical problems. As far as these principles are concerned, today 
the Principle of Nationalism means overthrowing Japanese imperialism, 
and the Principles of Democracy and People¹s Livelihood mean 
working in the interests not of just one section but of all the people 
who are against Japan. Throughout the country the people should 
enjoy freedom of the person, the right to take part in political activity 
and the right to protection of property. Throughout the country the 
people should have the opportunity of voicing their opinions, and 
they should have clothes to wear, food to eat, work to do and schools 
to attend; in short, some provision should be made for everyone. 
Chinese society is small at both ends and big in the middle, that is, 
the proletariat at one end and the landlord class and big bourgeoisie 
at the other each constitute only a small minority, while the great 
majority of the people consists of the peasants, the urban petty bourgeoisie 
and the other intermediate classes. No political party that 
wants to run China¹s affairs properly can do so unless its policy gives 
consideration to the interests of these classes, unless some provision 
is made for the members of these classes, and unless they have the 
right to voice their opinions. The policies put forward by the Chinese 
Communist Party seek to unite all the people who oppose Japan 
and take into account the interests of every class that does so, and 
especially the interests of the peasants, the urban petty bourgeoisie 
and the other intermediate classes. The policies of the Communist 
Party, which give all sections of the people the opportunity to voice 
their opinions and make sure they have work to do and food to eat, 
are policies embodying the genuinely revolutionary Three People¹s 
Principles. In agrarian relations, on the one hand we carry out reduction 
of rent and interest so that the peasants will have food, and on 
the other we provide for the payment of the reduced rent and interest 
so that the landlords, too, can live. In the relations between labour 
and capital, on the one hand we help the workers so that they have 
both work and food, and on the other we pursue a policy of developing 
industry so that the capitalists may obtain some profit. In all this 
our purpose is to unite the people of the whole country in the common

33 SPEECH AT THE BORDER REGION ASSEMBLY 
endeavour of resistance to Japan. This is what we call the policy of 
New Democracy. It is the kind of policy that really suits the conditions 
in present-day China, and we hope that its application will not 
be limited to the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, or to the 
anti-Japanese base areas in the rear of the enemy, but will spread 
throughout the country. 
We have pursued this policy with success and have won the 
approval of the people all over China. But there have also been 
shortcomings. Some Communists still do not know how to co-operate 
with non-Party people in a democratic way and have an exclusive, 
³dosed-door² or sectarian style of work; they still do not understand 
the basic principle that Communists are in duty bound to co-operate 
with people outside the Party who are against Japan, and have no 
right to shut them out. This principle means that we should listen 
attentively to the views of the masses, keep in close touch with them 
and not become alienated from them. There is an article in the 
Administrative Programme of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region 
which stipulates that Communists should co-operate democratically 
with non-Party people and must not act arbitrarily or keep 
everything in their own hands. It is directed precisely at the comrades 
who still fail to understand the Party¹s policy. Communists must 
listen attentively to the views of people outside the Party and let 
them have their say. If what they say is right, we ought to welcome 
it, and we should learn from their strong points; if it is wrong, we 
should let them finish what they are saying and then patiently explain 
things to them. A Communist must never be opinionated or domineering, 
or think that he is good in everything while others are 
good in nothing; he must never shut himself up in his little room, 
or brag and boast and lord it over others. Apart from the die-hard 
reactionaries who are in league with the Japanese aggressors and with 
the traitors and are sabotaging resistance and unity, and who of 
course have no right to speak, everyone is entitled to freedom of 
speech, and it does not matter even if what he says is wrong. Affairs 
of state are the public affairs of the whole nation and not the private 
affairs of a single party or group. Hence Communists have the duty 
to co-operate democratically with non-Party people and have no 
right to exclude them and monopolize everything. The Communist 
Party is a political party which works in the interests of the nation 
and people and which has absolutely no private ends to pursue. It 
should be supervised by the people and must never go against their

34 MAO TSE-TUNG 
will. Its members should be among the people and with them and 
must not set themselves above them. Members of the Assembly and 
Comrades, this Communist Party principle of democratic co-operation 
with non-Party people is fixed and unalterable. So long as parties 
exist, people who join them will always be a minority while those 
outside them will always be the majority; hence our Party members 
must always co-operate with non-Party people, and they should make 
a good start right here in the Assembly. With this policy of ours, I 
believe that Communist members of the Assembly will get very good 
training here and overcome their ³closed-doorism² and sectarianism. 
We are not a small opinionated sect and we must learn how to open 
our doors and co-operate democratically with non-Party people, and 
how to consult with others. Perhaps even now there are Communists 
who may say, ³If it is necessary to co-operate with others, then 
leave me out.² But I am sure there are very few. I can assure you 
that the overwhelming majority of our members will certainly be 
able to carry out the line of the Central Committee of our Party. At 
the same time I wish to ask all non-Party comrades to realize what 
we stand for, to understand that the Communist Party is not a small 
sect or clique pursuing private ends. No! The Communist Party 
sincerely and honestly wishes to set the affairs of state to rights. But 
we still have many failings. We are not afraid to admit them and 
are determined to get rid of them. We shall do so by strengthening 
education within the Party and by co-operating democratically with 
non-Party people. It is only by subjecting our failings to such a crossfire, 
both from within and from without, that we can remedy them 
and really set the affairs of state to rights. 
Members of the Assembly! You have taken the trouble to come 
here for this meeting, and I am happy to greet this distinguished 
gathering and wish it success.

RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
February 1, 1941 
The Party School opens today and I wish it every success. 
I would like to say something about the problem of our Party¹s 
style of work. 
Why must there be a revolutionary party? There must be a revolutionary 
party because the world contains enemies who oppress the 
people and the people want to throw off enemy oppression. In the 
era of capitalism and imperialism, just such a revolutionary party as 
the Communist Party is needed. Without such a party it is simply 
impossible for the people to throw off enemy oppression. We are 
Communists, we want to lead the people in overthrowing the enemy, 
and so we must keep our ranks in good order, we must march in step, 
our troops must be picked troops and our weapons good weapons. 
Without these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown. 
What is the problem now facing our Party? The general line of 
the Party is correct and presents no problem, and the Party¹s work 
has been fruitful. The Party has several hundred thousand members 
who are leading the people in extremely hard and bitter struggles 
against the enemy. This is plain to everybody and beyond all doubt. 
Then is there or is there not any problem still facing our Party? 
I say there is and, in a certain sense, the problem is quite serious. 
What is the problem? It is the fact that there is something in the 
minds of a number of our comrades which strikes one as not quite 
right, not quite proper. 
In other words, there is still something wrong with our style of 
study, with our style in the Party¹s internal and external relations 
and with our style of writing. By something wrong with the style of 
study we mean the malady of subjectivism. By something wrong with 
This speech was delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at the opening of the 
Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. 
35

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


DISTRIBUTION 
36 
our style in Party relations we mean the malady of sectarianism. By 
something wrong with the style of writing we mean the malady of 
stereotyped Party writing.1 All these are wrong, they are ill winds, 
but they are not like the wintry north winds that sweep across the 
whole sky. Subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing 
are no longer the dominant styles, but merely gusts of contrary wind, 
ill winds from the air-raid tunnels. (Laughter.) It is bad, however, 
that such winds should still be blowing in the Party. We must seal 
off the passages which produce them. Our whole Party should undertake 
the job of sealing off these passages, and so should the Party 
School. These three ill winds, subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped 
Party writing, have their historical origins. Although no longer 
dominant in the whole Party, they still constantly create trouble and 
assail us. Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to study, analyse 
and elucidate them. 
Fight subjectivism in order to rectify the style of study, fight 
sectarianism in order to rectify the style in Party relations, and fight 
Party stereotypes in order to rectify the style of writing  such is 
the task before us. 
To accomplish the task of overthrowing the enemy, we must 
accomplish the task of rectifying these styles within the Party. The 
style of study and the style of writing are also the Party¹s style of 
work. Once our Party¹s style of work is put completely right, the 
people all over the country will learn from our example. Those outside 
the Party who have the same kind of bad style will, if they are 
good and honest people, learn from our example and correct their 
mistakes, and thus the whole nation will be influenced. So long as 
our Communist ranks are in good order and march in step, so long 
as our troops are picked troops and our weapons are good weapons, 
any enemy, however powerful, can be overthrown. 
Let me speak now about subjectivism. 
Subjectivism is an improper style of study; it is opposed to 
Marxism-Leninism and is incompatible with the Communist Party. 
What we want is the Marxist-Leninist style of study. What we call 
style of study means not just style of study in the schools but in 
the whole Party. It is a question of the method of thinking of comrades 
in our leading bodies, of all cadres and Party members, a question 
of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, of the attitude of all 
Party comrades in their work. As such, it is a question of extraordinary, 
indeed of primary, importance.

37 RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
Certain muddled ideas find currency among many people. There 
are, for instance, muddled ideas about what is a theorist, what is an 
intellectual and what is meant by linking theory and practice. 
Let us first ask, is the theoretical level of our Party high or low? 
Recently more Marxist-Leninist works have been translated and more 
people have been reading them. That is a very good thing. But can 
we therefore say that the theoretical level of our Party has been 
greatly raised? True, the level is now somewhat higher than before. 
But our theoretical front is very much out of harmony with the rich 
content of the Chinese revolutionary movement, and a comparison 
of the two shows that the theoretical side is lagging far behind. 
Generally speaking, our theory cannot as yet keep pace with our 
revolutionary practice, let alone lead the way as it should. We have 
not yet raised our rich and varied practice to the proper theoretical 
plane. We have not yet examined all the problems of revolutionary 
practice  or even the important ones  and raised them to a theoretical 
plane. Just think, how many of us have created theories worthy 
of the name on China¹s economics, politics, military affairs or culture, 
theories which can be regarded as scientific and comprehensive, 
and not crude and sketchy? Especially in the field of economic 
theory: Chinese capitalism has had a century of development since 
the Opium War, and yet not a single theoretical work has been 
produced which accords with the realities of China¹s economic development 
and is genuinely scientific. Can we say that in the study of 
China¹s economic problems, for instance, the theoretical level is 
already high? Can we say that our Party already has economic 
theorists worthy of the name? Certainly not. We have read a great 
many Marxist-Leninist books, but can we claim, then, that we 
have theorists? We cannot. For Marxism-Leninism is the theory 
created by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on the basis of practice, 
their general conclusion drawn from historical and revolutionary 
reality. If we merely read their works but do not proceed to study 
the realities of China¹s history and revolution in the light of their 
theory or do not make any effort to think through China¹s revolutionary 
practice carefully in terms of theory, we should not be so 
presumptuous as to call ourselves Marxist theorists. Our achievements 
on the theoretical front will be very poor indeed if, as members of 
the Communist Party of China, we close our eyes to China¹s problems 
and can only memorize isolated conclusions or principles from 
Marxist writings. If all a person can do is to commit Marxist economics

38 MAO TSE-TUNG 
or philosophy to memory, reciting glibly from Chapter I to Chapter 
X, but is utterly unable to apply them, can he be considered a 
Marxist theorist? No! He cannot. What kind of theorists do we 
want? We want theorists who can, in accordance with the Marxist- 
Leninist stand, viewpoint and method, correctly interpret the 
practical problems arising in the course of history and revolution 
and give scientific explanations and theoretical elucidations of 
China¹s economic, political, military, cultural and other problems. 
Such are the theorists we want. To be a theorist of this kind, a 
person must have a true grasp of the essence of Marxism-Leninism, 
of the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method and of the 
theories of Lenin and Stalin on the colonial revolution and the 
Chinese revolution, and he must be able to apply them in a penetrating 
and scientific analysis of China¹s practical problems and discover 
the laws of development of these problems. Such are the theorists 
we really need. 
The Central Committee of our Party has now made a decision 
calling upon our comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist-Leninist 
stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study of China¹s history, 
and of China¹s economics, politics, military affairs and culture, and 
to analyse every problem concretely on the basis of detailed material 
and then draw theoretical conclusions. This is the responsibility we 
must shoulder. 
Our comrades in the Party School should not regard Marxist 
theory as lifeless dogma. It is necessary to master Marxist theory 
and apply it, master it for the sole purpose of applying it. If you 
can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating one or two 
practical problems, you should be commended and credited with 
some achievement. The more problems you elucidate and the more 
comprehensively and profoundly you do so, the greater will be your 
achievement. Our Party School should also lay down the rule to 
grade students good or poor according to how they look at China¹s 
problems after they have studied Marxism-Leninism, according to 
whether or not they see the problems clearly and whether or not 
they see them at all. 
Next let us talk about the question of the ³intellectuals². Since 
China is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country and her culture is not 
well developed, intellectuals are particularly treasured. On this question 
of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of the Party made 
the decision2 over two years ago that we should win over the great

39 RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they are revolutionary and 
willing to take part in the resistance to Japan, welcome them one 
and all. It is entirely right for us to esteem intellectuals, for without 
revolutionary intellectuals the revolution cannot triumph. But we all 
know there are many intellectuals who fancy themselves very learned 
and assume airs of erudition without realizing that such airs are bad 
and harmful and hinder their own progress. They ought to be aware 
of the truth that actually many so-called intellectuals are, relatively 
speaking, most ignorant and the workers and peasants sometimes 
know more than they do. Here some will say, ³Ha! You are turning 
things upside down and talking nonsense.² (Laughter.) But, comrades, 
don¹t get excited; there is some sense in what I am saying. 
What is knowledge? Ever since class society came into being 
the world has had only two kinds of knowledge, knowledge of the 
struggle for production and knowledge of the class struggle. Natural 
science and social science are the crystallizations of these two kinds 
of knowledge, and philosophy is the generalization and summation 
of the knowledge of nature and the knowledge of society. Is there 
any other kind of knowledge? No. Now let us take a look at certain 
students, those brought up in schools that are completely cut off 
from the practical activities of society. What about them? A person 
goes from a primary school of this kind all the way through to a 
university of the same kind, graduates and is reckoned to have a 
stock of learning. But all he has is book-learning; he has not yet 
taken part in any practical activities or applied what he has learned 
to any field of life. Can such a person be regarded as a completely 
developed intellectual? Hardly so, in my opinion, because his knowledge 
is still incomplete. What then is relatively complete knowledge? 
All relatively complete knowledge is formed in two stages: the first 
stage is perceptual knowledge, the second is rational knowledge, the 
latter being the development of the former to a higher stage. What 
sort of knowledge is the students¹ book-learning? Even supposing 
all their knowledge is truth, it is still not knowledge acquired through 
their own personal experience, but consists of theories set down by 
their predecessors in summarizing experience of the struggle for production 
and of the class struggle. It is entirely necessary that students 
should acquire this kind of knowledge, but it must be understood 
that as far as they are concerned such knowledge is in a sense still 
one-sided, something which has been verified by others but not yet 
by themselves. What is most important is to be good at applying this

40 MAO TSE-TUNG 
knowledge in life and in practice. Therefore, I advise those who 
have only book-learning but as yet no contact with reality, and also 
those with little practical experience, to realize their own shortcomings 
and become a little more modest. 
How can those who have only book-learning be turned into 
intellectuals in the true sense? The only way is to get them to take 
part in practical work and become practical workers, to get those 
engaged in theoretical work to study important practical problems. 
In this way our aim can be attained. 
What I have said will probably make some people angry. They 
will say, ³According to your explanation, even Marx would not be 
regarded as an intellectual.² I say they are wrong. Marx took part 
in the practice of the revolutionary movement and also created revolutionary 
theory. Beginning with the commodity, the simplest element 
of capitalism, he made a thorough study of the economic structure 
of capitalist society. Millions of people saw and handled commodities 
every day but were so used to them that they took no notice. Marx 
alone studied commodities scientifically. He carried out a tremendous 
work of research into their actual development and derived a 
thoroughly scientific theory from what existed universally. He studied 
nature, history and proletarian revolution and created dialectical 
materialism, historical materialism and the theory of proletarian 
revolution. Thus Marx became a most completely developed intellectual, 
representing the acme of human wisdom; he was fundamentally 
different from those who have only book-learning. Marx 
undertook detailed investigations and studies in the course of practical 
struggles, formed generalizations and then verified his conclusions 
by testing them in practical struggles  this is what we call theoretical 
work. Our Party needs a large number of comrades who will learn 
how to do such work. In our Party there are many comrades who 
can learn to do this kind of theoretical research; most of them are 
intelligent and promising and we should value them. But they must 
follow correct principles and not repeat the mistake of the past. They 
must discard dogmatism and not confine themselves to ready-made 
phrases in books. 
There is only one kind of true theory in this world, theory that is 
drawn from objective reality and then verified by objective reality; 
nothing else is worthy of the name of theory in our sense. Stalin said 
that theory becomes aimless when it is not connected with practice.3 
Aimless theory is useless and false and should be discarded. We should

41 RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
point the finger of scorn at those who are fond of aimless theorizing. 
Marxism-Leninism is the most correct, scientific and revolutionary 
truth, born out of and verified by objective reality, but many who 
study Marxism-Leninism take it as lifeless dogma, thus impeding 
the development of theory and harming themselves as well as 
other comrades. 
On the other hand, our comrades who are engaged in practical 
work will also come to grief if they misuse their experience. True, 
these people are often rich in experience, which is very valuable, but 
it is very dangerous if they rest content with their own experience. 
They must realize that their knowledge is mostly perceptual and 
partial and that they lack rational and comprehensive knowledge; 
in other words, they lack theory and their knowledge, too, is relatively 
incomplete. Without comparatively complete knowledge it is 
impossible to do revolutionary work well. 
Thus, there are two kinds of incomplete knowledge, one is readymade 
knowledge found in books and the other is knowledge that 
is mostly perceptual and partial; both are one-sided. Only an integration 
of the two can yield knowledge that is sound and relatively 
complete. 
In order to study theory, however, our cadres of working-class 
and peasant origin must first acquire an elementary education. Without 
it they cannot learn Marxist-Leninist theory. Having acquired it, 
they can study Marxism-Leninism at any time. In my childhood I 
never attended a Marxist-Leninist school and was taught only such 
things as, ³The Master said: How pleasant it is to learn and constantly 
review what one has learned.¹²4 Though this teaching material 
was antiquated, it did me some good because from it I learned to 
read. Nowadays we no longer study the Confucian classics but such 
new subjects as modern Chinese, history, geography and elementary 
natural science, which, once learned, are useful everywhere. The 
Central Committee of our Party now emphatically requires that our 
cadres of working-class and peasant origin should obtain an elementary 
education because they can then take up any branch of study  
politics, military science or economics. Otherwise, for all their rich 
experience they will never be able to study theory. 
It follows that to combat subjectivism we must enable people 
of each of these two types to develop in whichever direction they 
are deficient and to merge with the other type. Those with booklearning 
must develop in the direction of practice; it is only in this

42 MAO TSE-TUNG 
way that they will stop being content with books and avoid committing 
dogmatist errors. Those experienced in work must take up the study of 
theory and must read seriously; only then will they be able to systematize 
and synthesize their experience and raise it to the level of theory, only 
then will they not mistake their partial experience for universal truth 
and not commit empiricist errors. Dogmatism and empiricism alike 
are subjectivism, each originating from an opposite pole. 
Hence there are two kinds of subjectivism in our Party, dogmatism 
and empiricism. Each sees only a part and not the whole. If people 
are not on guard, do not realize that such one-sidedness is a shortcoming 
and do not strive to overcome it, they are liable to go astray. 
However, of the two kinds of subjectivism, dogmatism is still 
the greater danger in our Party. For dogmatists can easily assume 
a Marxist guise to bluff, capture and make servitors of cadres of 
working-class and peasant origin who cannot easily see through them; 
they can also bluff and ensnare the naive youth. If we overcome 
dogmatism, cadres with book-learning will readily join with those 
who have experience and will take to the study of practical things, 
and then many good cadres who integrate theory with experience, 
as well as some real theorists, will emerge. If we overcome dogmatism, 
the comrades with practical experience will have good teachers to 
help them raise their experience to the level of theory and so avoid 
empiricist errors. 
Besides muddled ideas about the ³theorist² and the ³intellectual², 
there is a muddled idea among many comrades about ³linking theory 
and practice², a phrase they have on their lips every day. They talk 
constantly about ³linking², but actually they mean ³separating², because 
they make no effort at linking. How is Marxist-Leninist theory 
to be linked with the practice of the Chinese revolution? To use a 
common expression, it is by ³shooting the arrow at the target². As 
the arrow is to the target, so is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese 
revolution. Some comrades, however, are ³shooting without a target², 
shooting at random, and such people are liable to harm the revolution. 
Others merely stroke the arrow fondly, exclaiming, ³What a 
fine arrow! What a fine arrow!², but never want to shoot it. These 
people are only connoisseurs of curios and have virtually nothing 
to do with the revolution. The arrow of Marxism-Leninism must be 
used to shoot at the target of the Chinese revolution. Unless this point 
is made clear, the theoretical level of our Party can never be raised 
and the Chinese revolution can never be victorious.

43 RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
Our comrades must understand that we study Marxism-Leninism 
not for display, nor because there is any mystery about it, but solely 
because it is the science which leads the revolutionary cause of the 
proletariat to victory. Even now, there are not a few people who 
still regard odd quotations from Marxist-Leninist works as a readymade 
panacea which, once acquired, can easily cure all maladies. 
These people show childish ignorance, and we should enlighten them. 
It is precisely such ignorant people who take Marxism-Leninism as 
a religious dogma. To them we should say bluntly, ³Your dogma 
is worthless.² Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have repeatedly stated 
that our theory is not a dogma but a guide to action. But such people 
prefer to forget this statement which is of the greatest, indeed the 
utmost, importance. Chinese Communists can be regarded as linking 
theory with practice only when they become good at applying the 
Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method and the teachings of 
Lenin and Stalin concerning the Chinese revolution and when, furthermore, 
through serious research into the realities of China¹s history 
and revolution, they do creative theoretical work to meet China¹s 
needs in different spheres. Merely talking about linking theory and 
practice without actually doing anything about it is of no use, evenif 
one goes on talking for a hundred years. To oppose the subjectivist, 
one-sided approach to problems, we must demolish dogmatist subjectiveness 
and one-sidedness. 
So much for today about combating subjectivism in order to rectify 
the style of study throughout the Party. 
Let me now speak about the question of sectarianism. 
Having been steeled for twenty years, our Party is no longer 
dominated by sectarianism. Remnants of sectarianism, however, are 
still found both in the Party¹s internal relations and in its external relations. 
Sectarian tendencies in internal relations lead to exclusiveness 
towards comrades inside the Party and hinder inner-Party unity and 
solidarity, while sectarian tendencies in external relations lead to exclusiveness 
towards people outside the Party and hinder the Party in its 
task of uniting the whole people. Only by uprooting this evil in both its 
aspects can the Party advance unimpeded in its great task of achieving 
unity among all Party comrades and among all the people of our country. 
What are the remnants of inner-Party sectarianism? They are 
mainly as follows: 
First, the assertion of ³independence². Some comrades see only 
the interests of the part and not the whole; they always put undue

44 MAO TSE-TUNG 
stress on that part of the work for which they themselves are responsible 
and always wish to subordinate the interests of the whole to 
the interests of their own part. They do not understand the Party¹s 
system of democratic centralism; they do not realize that the Communist 
Party not only needs democracy but needs centralization even 
more. They forget the system of democratic centralism in which the 
minority is subordinate to the majority, the lower level to the higher 
level, the part to the whole and the entire membership to the Central 
Committee. Chang Kuo-tao5 asserted his ³independence² of the 
Central Committee of the Party and as a result ³asserted² himself 
into betraying the Party and became a Kuomintang agent. Although 
the sectarianism we are now discussing is not of this extremely 
serious kind, it must still be guarded against and we must do away 
completely with all manifestations of disunity. We should encourage 
comrades to take the interests of the whole into account. Every Party 
member, every branch of work, every statement and every action 
must proceed from the interests of the whole Party; it is absolutely 
impermissible to violate this principle. 
Those who assert this kind of ³independence² are usually wedded 
to the doctrine of ³me first² and are generally wrong on the question 
of the relationship between the individual and the Party. Although 
in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice they put themselves 
first and the Party second. What are these people after? They 
are after fame and position and want to be in the limelight. Whenever 
they are put in charge of a branch of work, they assert their 
³independence². With this aim, they draw some people in, push others 
out and resort to boasting, flattery and touting among the comrades, 
thus importing the vulgar style of the bourgeois political parties into 
the Communist Party. It is their dishonesty that causes them to 
come to grief. I believe we should do things honestly, for without 
an honest attitude it is absolutely impossible to accomplish anything 
in this world. Which are the honest people? Marx, Engels, Lenin 
and Stalin are honest, men of science are honest. Which are the 
dishonest people? Trotsky, Bukharin, Chen Tu-hsiu and Chang 
Kuo-tao are extremely dishonest; and those who assert ³independence² 
out of personal or sectional interest are dishonest too. All sly 
people, all those who do not have a scientific attitude in their work, 
fancy themselves resourceful and clever, but in fact they are most 
stupid and will come to no good. Students in our Party School must 
pay attention to this problem. We must build a centralized, unified

45 RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
Party and make a clean sweep of all unprincipled factional struggles. 
We must combat individualism and sectarianism so as to enable our 
whole Party to march in step and fight for one common goal. 
Cadres from the outside and those from the locality must unite 
and combat sectarian tendencies. Very careful attention must be 
given to the relations between outside and local cadres because many 
anti-Japanese base areas were established only after the arrival of 
the Eighth Route Army or the New Fourth Army and much of the 
local work developed only after the arrival of outside cadres. Our 
comrades must understand that in these conditions it is possible for 
our base areas to be consolidated and for our Party to take root there 
only when the two kinds of cadres unite as one and when a large 
number of local cadres develop and are promoted; otherwise it is 
impossible. Both the outside and the local cadres have their strong 
and weak points, and to make any progress they must overcome their 
own weak points by learning from each other¹s strong points. The 
outside cadres are generally not up to the local cadres in familiarity 
with local conditions and links with the masses. Take me for instance. 
Although I have been in northern Shensi five or six years, I am far 
behind the local comrades in understanding local conditions and in 
links with the people here. Our comrades going to the anti-Japanese 
base areas in Shansi, Hopei, Shantung and other provinces must pay 
attention to this. Moreover, even within the same base area, owing 
to the fact that some districts develop earlier and others later, there 
is a difference between the local cadres of a district and those from 
outside it. Cadres who come from a more developed to a less developed 
district are also outside cadres in relation to that locality, and 
they, too, should pay great attention to fostering and helping local 
cadres. Generally speaking, in places where outside cadres are in 
charge, it is they who should bear the main responsibility if their 
relations with the local cadres are not good. And the chief comrades 
in charge should bear greater responsibility. The attention paid to 
this problem in some places is still very inadequate. Some people look 
down on the local cadres and ridicule them, saying, ³What do these 
locals know? Clodhoppers!² Such people utterly fail to understand 
the importance of local cadres; they know neither the latter¹s strong 
points nor their own weaknesses and adopt an incorrect, sectarian 
attitude. All outside cadres must cherish the local cadres and give 
them constant help and must not be permitted to ridicule or attack 
them. Of course, the local cadres on their part must learn from the

46 MAO TSE-TUNG 
strong points of the outside cadres and rid themselves of inappropriate, 
narrow views so that they and the outside cadres become as 
one, with no distinction between ³them² and ³us², and thus avoid 
sectarian tendencies. 
The same applies to the relationship between cadres in army 
service and other cadres working in the locality. They must be completely 
united and must oppose sectarian tendencies. The army cadres 
must help the local cadres, and vice versa. If there is friction between 
them, each should make allowance for the other and carry out proper 
self-criticism. Generally speaking, in places where army cadres are 
actually in positions of leadership, it is they who should bear the 
main responsibility if their relations with the local cadres are not 
good. Only when the army cadres understand their own responsibility 
and are modest in their attitude towards the local cadres can the 
conditions be created for the smooth progress of our war effort and 
our work of construction in the base areas. 
The same applies to the relationship among different army units, 
different localities and different departments. We must oppose the 
tendency towards selfish departmentalism by which the interests of 
one¹s own unit are looked after to the exclusion of those of others. 
Whoever is indifferent to the difficulties of others, refuses to transfer 
cadres to other units on request, or releases only the inferior ones, 
³using the neighbour¹s field as an outlet for his overflow², and does 
not give the slightest consideration to other departments, localities or 
people  such a person is a selfish departmentalist who has entirely 
lost the spirit of communism. Lack of consideration for the whole and 
complete indifference to other departments, localities and people are 
characteristics of a selfish departmentalist. We must intensify our 
efforts to educate such persons and to make them understand that 
selfish departmentalism is a sectarian tendency which will become very 
dangerous, if allowed to develop. 
Another problem is the relationship between old and new cadres. 
Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, our Party has grown 
enormously, and large numbers of new cadres have emerged; that 
is a very good thing. In his report to the Eighteenth Congress of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B.), Comrade Stalin said, 
³. . . there are never enough old cadres, there are far less than required, 
and they are already partly going out of commission owing 
to the operation of the laws of nature.² Here he was discussing the 
cadres situation and not only the laws of nature. If our Party does not

47 RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
have a great many new cadres working in unity and co-operation with 
the old cadres, our cause will come to a stop. All old cadres, therefore, 
should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and show 
them the warmest solicitude. True, new cadres have their shortcomings. 
They have not been long in the revolution and lack experience, 
and unavoidably some have brought with them vestiges of the unwholesome 
ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology of 
petty-bourgeois individualism. But such shortcomings can be gradually 
eliminated through education and tempering in the revolution. The 
strong point of the new cadres, as Stalin has said, is that they are 
acutely sensitive to what is new and are therefore enthusiastic 
and active to a high degree  the very qualities which some of the 
old cadres lack.6 Cadres, new and old, should respect each other, 
learn from each other and overcome their own shortcomings by learning 
from each other¹s strong points, so as to unite as one in the common 
cause and guard against sectarian tendencies. Generally speaking, in 
places where the old cadres are mainly in charge, it is they who 
should bear the chief responsibility if relations with the new cadres 
are not good. 
All the above  relations between the part and the whole, relations 
between the individual and the Party, relations between outside 
and local cadres, relations between army cadres and other cadres 
working in the locality, relations between this and that army unit, 
between this and that locality, between this and that department and 
relations between old and new cadres  are relations within the 
Party. In all these relations it is necessary to enhance the spirit of 
communism and guard against sectarian tendencies, so that the ranks 
of our Party will be in good order, march in step and therefore fight 
well. This is a very important problem which we must solve thoroughly 
in rectifying the Party¹s style of work. Sectarianism is an expression 
of subjectivism in organizational relations; if we want to get rid of 
subjectivism and promote the Marxist-Leninist spirit of seeking truth 
from facts, we must sweep the remnants of sectarianism out of the 
Party and proceed from the principle that the Party¹s interests are 
above personal or sectional interests, so that the Party can attain 
complete solidarity and unity. 
The remnants of sectarianism must be eliminated from the Party¹s 
external as well as its internal relations. The reason is this: we cannot 
defeat the enemy by merely uniting the comrades throughout the 
Party, we can defeat the enemy only by uniting the people throughout

48 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the country. For twenty years the Communist Party of China has 
done great and arduous work in the cause of uniting the people of 
the whole country, and the achievements in this work since the outbreak 
of the War of Resistance are even greater than in the past. 
This does not mean, however, that all our comrades already have a 
correct style in dealing with the masses and are free from sectarian 
tendencies. No. In fact, sectarian tendencies still exist among a number 
of comrades, and in some cases to a very serious degree. Many 
of our comrades tend to be overbearing in their relations with non- 
Party people, look down upon them, despise or refuse to respect them 
or appreciate their strong points. This is indeed a sectarian tendency. 
After reading a few Marxist books, such comrades become more 
arrogant instead of more modest, and invariably dismiss others as 
no good without realizing that in fact their own knowledge is only 
half-baked. Our comrades must realize the truth that Communist 
Party members are at all times a minority as compared with non- 
Party people. Supposing one out of every hundred persons were a 
Communist, then there would be 4,500,000 Communists among 
China¹s population of 450,000,000. Yet, even if our membership 
reached this huge figure, Communists would still form only one per 
cent of the whole population, while 99 per cent would be non-Party 
people. What reason can we then have for not co-operating with non- 
Party people? As regards all those who wish to co-operate with us 
or might co-operate with us, we have only the duty of co-operating 
and absolutely no right to shut them out. But some Party members 
do not understand this and look down upon, or even shut out, those 
who wish to co-operate with us. There are no grounds whatsoever 
for doing so. Have Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin given us any 
grounds? They have not. On the contrary, they have always earnestly 
enjoined us to form close ties with the masses and not divorce ourselves 
from them. Or has the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China given us any grounds? No. Among all its resolutions 
there is not a single one that says we may divorce ourselves from the 
masses and so isolate ourselves. On the contrary, the Central Committee 
has always told us to form close ties with the masses and not 
to divorce ourselves from them. Thus any action divorcing us from 
the masses has no justification at all and is simply the mischievous 
result of the sectarian ideas some of our comrades have themselves 
concocted. As such sectarianism remains very serious among some of 
our comrades and still obstructs the application of the Party line, we

49 RECTIFY THE PARTY¹S STYLE OF WORK 
should carry out extensive education within the Party to meet this 
problem. Above all, we should make our cadres really understand 
how serious the problem is and how utterly impossible it is to overthrow 
the enemy and attain the goal of the revolution unless Party 
members unite with the non-Party cadres and with non-Party people. 
All sectarian ideas are subjectivist and are incompatible with the 
real needs of the revolution; hence the struggle against sectarianism 
and the struggle against subjectivism should go on simultaneously. 
There is no time today to talk about the question of stereotyped 
Party writing; I shall discuss it at another meeting. Stereotyped Party 
writing is a vehicle for filth, a form of expression for subjectivism 
and sectarianism. It does people harm and damages the revolution, 
and we must get rid of it completely. 
To combat subjectivism we must propagate materialism and 
dialectics. However, there are many comrades in our Party who lay 
no stress on the propaganda either of materialism or of dialectics. 
Some tolerate subjectivist propaganda and regard it with equanimity. 
They think they believe in Marxism, but make no effort to propagate 
materialism and do not give it a thought or express any opinion when 
they hear or read subjectivist stuff. This is not the attitude of a Communist. 
It allows many of our comrades to be poisoned by subjectivist 
ideas, which numb their sensitivity. We should therefore launch a 
campaign of enlightenment within the Party to free the minds of 
our comrades from the fog of subjectivism and dogmatism and should 
call upon them to boycott subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped 
Party writing. Such evils are like Japanese goods, for only our enemy 
wishes us to preserve them and continue to befuddle ourselves with 
them; so we should advocate a boycott against them, just as we boycott 
Japanese goods.7 We should boycott all the wares of subjectivism, 
sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing, make their sale difficult, 
and not allow their purveyors to ply their trade by exploiting the low 
theoretical level in the Party. Our comrades must develop a good 
nose for this purpose; they should take a sniff at everything and distinguish 
the good from the bad before they decide whether to welcome 
it or boycott it. Communists must always go into the whys and wherefores 
of anything, use their own heads and carefully think over 
whether or not it corresponds to reality and is really well founded; on 
no account should they follow blindly and encourage slavishness. 
Finally, in opposing subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped 
Party writing we must have in mind two purposes: first, ³learn

50 MAO TSE-TUNG 
from past mistakes to avoid future ones², and second, ³cure the 
sickness to save the patient². The mistakes of the past must be exposed 
without sparing anyone¹s sensibilities; it is necessary to analyse 
and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientific attitude so 
that work in the future will be done more carefully and done better. 
This is what is meant by ³learn from past mistakes to avoid future 
ones². But our aim in exposing errors and criticizing shortcomings, 
like that of a doctor curing a sickness, is solely to save the patient 
and not to doctor him to death. A person with appendicitis is 
saved when the surgeon removes his appendix. So long as a person 
who has made mistakes does not hide his sickness for fear of treatment 
or persist in his mistakes until he is beyond cure, so long as he 
honestly and sincerely wishes to be cured and to mend his ways, we 
should welcome him and cure his sickness so that he can become a 
good comrade. We can never succeed if we just let ourselves go, 
and lash out at him. In treating an ideological or a political malady, 
one must never be rough and rash but must adopt the approach of 
³curing the sickness to save the patient², which is the only correct 
and effective method. 
I have taken this occasion of the opening of the Party School to 
speak at length, and I hope comrades will think over what I have 
said. (Enthusiastic applause.) 
NOTES 
1 Stereotyped writing, or the ³eight-legged essay², was the special form of essay 
prescribed in the imperial examinations under China¹s feudal dynasties from the 
15th to the 19th centuries; it consisted in juggling with words, concentrated only on 
form and was devoid of content. Structurally the main body of the essay had eight 
parts  presentation, amplification, preliminary exposition, initial argument, inceptive 
paragraphs, middle paragraphs, rear paragraphs and concluding paragraphs, and the 
fifth to eighth parts each had to have two ³legs², i.e., two antithetical paragraphs, 
hence the name ³eight-legged essay². The ³eight-legged essay² became a byword 
in China denoting stereotyped formalism and triteness. Thus ³stereotyped Party 
writing² characterizes the writings of certain people in the revolutionary ranks who 
piled up revolutionary phrases and terms higgledy-piggledy instead of analysing the 
facts. Like the ³eight-legged essay², their writings were nothing but verbiage. 
2 This was the decision on recruiting intellectuals adopted by the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China in December 1939, which is printed under 
the title ³Recruit Large Numbers of Intellectuals² in the Selected Work of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. II.

5 Chang Kuo-tao was a renegade from the Chinese revolution. In early life 
speculating on the revolution, he joined the Chinese Communist Party. In the Party 
he made many mistakes resulting in serious crimes. The most notorious of these 
was his Opposition, in 1935, to the Red Army¹s northward march and his defeatism 
and liquidationism in advocating withdrawal by the Red Army to the minoritynationality 
areas on the Szechuan-Sikang borders; what is more, he openly carried 
out traitorous activities against the Party and the Central Committee, established his 
own bogus central committee, disrupted the unity of the Party and the Red Army, 
and caused heavy losses to the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army. But thanks 
to patient education by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and the Central Committee, the 
Fourth Front Army and its numerous cadres soon returned to the correct leadership 
of the Central Committee of the Party and played a glorious role in subsequent 
struggles. Chang Kuo-tao, however, proved incorrigible and in the spring of 1938 
he slipped out of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and joined the Kuomintang 
secret police.

OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
February 8, 1942
Comrade Kai-feng has just stated the purpose of today¹s meeting. 
I now want to discuss the ways subjectivism and sectarianism use 
stereotyped Party writing (or the Party ³eight-legged essay²)1 as 
their instrument of propaganda or form of expression. We are fighting 
against subjectivism and sectarianism, but they will still have a hidingplace 
to lurk in if at the same time we do not get rid of stereotyped 
Party writing. If we destroy that too, we shall ³checkmate² subjectivism 
and sectarianism and make both these monsters show themselves 
in their true colours, and then we shall easily be able to annihilate 
them, like ³rats running across the street with everyone yelling: Kill 
them! Kill them!² 
It does not matter much if a person produces stereotyped Party 
writings only for himself to read. If he passes them on to someone 
else, the number of readers is doubled, and already no small harm 
is done. If he has them posted up, mimeographed, printed in newspapers 
or published in book form, then the problem becomes indeed 
a big one, for they can influence many people. And those who produce 
stereotyped Party writing always seek large audiences. Thus it has 
become imperative to expose and destroy it. 
Stereotyped Party writing is, moreover, one brand of the ³foreign 
stereotype², which was attacked by Lu Hsun a long time ago.2 Why 
then do we call it the Party ³eight-legged essay²? Because, besides 
its foreign flavour, it has some smell of native soil. Perhaps it too 
can be counted as creative work of a sort! Who says our people have 
not produced any creative works? Here is one! (Loud laughter.) 
Stereotyped Party writing has a long history in our Party; particularly 
during the Agrarian Revolution, it sometimes became quite 
rampant. 
This speech was delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at a cadres¹ meeting in 
Yenan. 
53

54 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Viewed historically, stereotyped Party writing is a reaction to the 
May 4th Movement. 
During the May 4th Movement, modern-minded people opposed 
the use of the classical Chinese language and advocated vernacular 
Chinese, opposed the traditional dogmas and advocated science and 
democracy, all of which was quite right. The movement then was 
vigorous and lively, progressive and revolutionary. In those days the 
ruling classes indoctrinated students with Confucian teachings and 
compelled the people to venerate all the trappings of Confucianism 
as religious dogma, and all writers used the classical language. In 
short, what was written and taught by the ruling classes and their 
hangers-on was in the nature of stereotyped writing and dogma, both 
in content and in form. That was the old stereotype and the old 
dogma. A tremendous achievement of the May 4th Movement was 
its public exposure of the ugliness of the old stereotype and the old 
dogma and its call to the people to rise against them. Another great 
and related achievement was its fight against imperialism, but the 
struggle against the old stereotype and the old dogma remains one 
of the great achievements of the May 4th Movement. Later on, 
however, foreign stereotyped writing and foreign dogma came into 
being. Running counter to Marxism, certain people in our Party 
developed the foreign stereotype and dogma into subjectivism, sectarianism 
and stereotyped Party writing. These are the new stereotype 
and the new dogma. They have become so deeply ingrained in the 
minds of many comrades that today we still have a very strenuous 
job of remoulding to do. Thus we see that the lively, vigorous, progressive 
and revolutionary movement of the May 4th period which 
fought the old feudal stereotyped writing and dogma was later turned 
by some people into its very opposite, giving rise to the new stereotyped 
writing and dogma. The latter are not lively and vigorous but 
dead and stiff, not progressive but retrogressive, not revolutionary 
but obstacles to revolution. That is to say, the foreign stereotyped 
writing, or stereotyped Party writing, is a reaction to the original 
nature of the May 4th Movement. The May 4th Movement, however, 
had its own weaknesses. Many of the leaders lacked the critical 
spirit of Marxism, and the method they used was generally that of 
the bourgeoisie, that is, the formalist method. They were quite right 
in opposing the old stereotype and the old dogma and in advocating 
science and democracy. But in dealing with current conditions, with 
history, and with things foreign, they lacked the critical spirit of his

55 OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
torical materialism and regarded what was bad as absolutely and 
wholly bad and what was good as absolutely and wholly good. This 
formalist approach to problems affected the subsequent course of the 
movement. In its development, the May 4th Movement divided into 
two currents. One section inherited its scientific and democratic spirit 
and transformed it on the basis of Marxism; this is what the Communists 
and some non-Party Marxists did. Another section took the 
road of the bourgeoisie; this was the development of formalism 
towards the Right. But within the Communist Party too the situation 
was not uniform; there, too, some members deviated and, lacking a 
firm grasp of Marxism, committed errors of formalism, namely, the 
errors of subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing. 
This was the development of formalism towards the ³Left². So it 
can be seen that stereotyped Party writing is no accident, but is, on 
the one hand, a reaction to the positive elements of the May 4th 
Movement and, on the other, a legacy, a continuation or development 
of its negative elements. It is useful for us to understand this point. 
Just as it was revolutionary and necessary to fight the old stereotyped 
writing and the old dogmatism during the period of the May 4th 
Movement, so it is revolutionary and necessary today for us to use 
Marxism to criticize the new stereotyped writing and the new dogmatism. 
If there had been no fight against the old stereotype and the 
old dogmatism during the May 4th period, the minds of the Chinese 
people would not have been freed from bondage to them, and China 
would have no hope of freedom and independence. This task was 
merely begun in the period of the May 4th Movement, and a very 
great effort  a huge job of work on the road of revolutionary 
remoulding  is still necessary to enable the whole people to free 
themselves completely from the domination of the old stereotype and 
dogmatism. If today we do not oppose the new stereotyped writing 
and the new dogmatism, the minds of the Chinese people will be 
fettered by formalism of another kind. If we do not get rid of the 
poison of stereotyped Party writing and the error of dogmatism found 
among a section (only a section, of course) of Party comrades, then 
it will be impossible to arouse a vigorous and lively revolutionary 
spirit, to eradicate the bad habit of taking a wrong attitude towards 
Marxism and to disseminate and develop true Marxism; furthermore, 
it will be impossible to conduct an energetic struggle against the influence 
of the old stereotyped writing and dogma among the whole 
and against that of foreign stereotyped writing and dogma

56 MAO TSE-TUNG 
among many of the people, and impossible to attain the purpose of 
demolishing and sweeping away these influences. 
Subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing  all 
three are anti-Marxist and meet the needs not of the proletariat but 
of the exploiting classes. They are a reflection of petty-bourgeois 
ideology in our Party. China is a country with a very large petty 
bourgeoisie and our Party is surrounded by this enormous class; a 
great number of our Party members come from this class, and when 
they join the Party they inevitably drag in with them a petty-bourgeois 
tail, be it long or short. Unless checked and transformed, the fanaticism 
and one-sidedness of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries can easily 
engender subjectivism and sectarianism, of which foreign stereotyped 
writing, or stereotyped Party writing, is one form of expression. 
It is not easy to clean out these things and sweep them away. It 
must be done properly, that is, by taking pains to reason with people. 
If we reason earnestly and properly, it will be effective. The first 
thing to do in this reasoning process is to give the patient a good 
shake-up by shouting at him, ³You are ill!² so as to administer a 
shock and make him break out in a sweat, and then to give him 
sincere advice on getting treatment. 
Let us now analyse stereotyped Party writing and see where its 
evils lie. Using poison as an antidote to poison, we shall imitate the 
form of the stereotyped eight-section essay and set forth the following 
³eight-legs², which might be called the eight major indictments. 
The first indictment against stereotyped Party writing is that it 
fills endless pages with empty verbiage. Some of our comrades love 
to write long articles with no substance, very much like the ³footbindings 
of a slattern, long as well as smelly². Why must they write 
such long and empty articles? There can be only one explanation; 
they are determined the masses shall not read them. Because the 
articles are long and empty, the masses shake their heads at the very 
sight of them. How can they be expected to read them? Such writings 
are good for nothing except to bluff the naive, among whom they 
spread bad influences and foster bad habits. On June 22 last year the 
Soviet Union began waging a gigantic war against aggression, and 
yet Stalin¹s speech on July 3 was only the length of an editorial in 
our Liberation Daily. Had any of our gentlemen written that speech, 
just imagine. It would have run to tens of thousands of words at 
a minimum. We are in the midst of a war, and we should learn how 
to write shorter and pithier articles. Although there is as yet no fight

57 OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
ing here in Yenan, our troops at the front are daily engaged in battle, 
and the people in the rear are busy at work. If articles are too long, 
who will read them? Some comrades at the front, too, like to write 
long reports. They take pains over writing them and send them here 
for us to read. But who has the hardihood to read them? If long and 
empty articles are no good, are short and empty ones any better? 
They are no good either. We should forbid all empty talk. But the 
first and foremost task is to throw the long, smelly foot-bindings of 
the slattern into the dustbin. Some may ask, ³Isn¹t Capital very 
long? What are we to do about that?² The answer is simple, just go 
on reading it. There is a proverb, ³Sing different songs on different 
mountains²; another runs, ³Fit the appetite to the dishes and the 
dress to the figure². Whatever we do must be done according to 
actual circumstances, and it is the same with writing articles and 
making speeches. What we oppose is long-winded and empty stereotyped 
writing, but we do not mean that everything must necessarily 
be short in order to be good. True, we need short articles in war 
time, but above all we need articles that have substance. Articles 
devoid of substance are the least justifiable and the most objectionable. 
The same applies to speech-making; we must put an end to all 
empty, long-winded speeches. 
The second indictment against stereotyped Party writing is that 
it strikes a pose in order to intimidate people. Some stereotyped 
Party writing is not only long and empty, but also pretentious with 
the deliberate intention of intimidating people; it carries the worst 
kind of poison. Writing long-winded and empty articles may be set 
down to immaturity, but striking a pose to overawe people is not 
merely immature but downright knavish. Lu Hsun once said in criticism 
of such people, ³Hurling insults and threats is certainly not 
fighting.²3 What is scientific never fears criticism, for science is truth 
and fears no refutation. But those who write subjectivist and sectarian 
articles and speeches in the form of Party stereotypes fear refutation, 
are very cowardly, and therefore rely on pretentiousness to overawe 
others, believing that they can thereby silence people and ³win the 
day². Such pretentiousness cannot reflect truth but is an obstacle to 
truth. Truth does not strike a pose to overawe people but talks and 
acts honestly and sincerely. Two terms used to appear in the articles 
in speeches of many comrades, one being ³ruthless struggle² and 
the other merciless blows². Measures of that kind are entirely necessary 
against the enemy or against enemy ideology, but to use them

58 MAO TSE-TUNG 
against our own comrades is wrong. It often happens that enemies 
and enemy ideology infiltrate into the Party, as is discussed in Item 
4 of the Conclusion of the History of the Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Short Course. Against these enemies, we 
must undoubtedly resort to ruthless struggle and merciless blows, 
because the scoundrels use these very measures against the Party; if 
we were tolerant of them, we should fall right into their trap. But 
the same measures should not be used against comrades who occasionally 
make mistakes; to them we should apply the method of 
criticism and self-criticism, the method indicated in Item 5 of the 
Conclusion of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
(Bolsheviks), Short Course. The comrades who in the past loudly 
advocated ³ruthless struggle² and ³merciless blows² against comrades 
who occasionally made mistakes did so because, for one thing, 
they failed to make any analysis of the persons they were dealing 
with and, for another, they were striking a pose in an effort to 
intimidate. This method is no good, no matter whom you are dealing 
with. Against the enemy this tactic of intimidation is utterly useless, 
and with our own comrades it can only do harm. It is a tactic 
which the exploiting classes and the lumpen-proletariat habitually 
practise, but for which the proletariat has no use. For the proletariat 
the sharpest and most effective weapon is a serious and militant 
scientific attitude. The Communist Party lives by the truth of Marxism- 
Leninism, by seeking truth from facts, by science, and not by intimidating 
people. Needless to say, the idea of attaining fame and 
position for oneself by pretentiousness is even more contemptible. 
In short, when organizations make decisions and issue instructions 
and when comrades write articles and make speeches, they must 
without exception depend on Marxist-Leninist truth and seek to 
serve a useful purpose. This is the only basis on which victory in the 
revolution can be achieved; all else is of no avail. 
The third indictment against stereotyped Party writing is that 
it shoots at random, without considering the audience. A few years 
ago a slogan appeared on the Yenan city wall which read, ³Working 
men and peasants, unite and strive for victory in the War of Resistance 
Against Japan!² The idea of the slogan was not at all bad, but the 
character ³1² [kung, meaning working] in ³12² [kung jen, 
meaning working men], was written as ³3², with its perpendicular 
stroke twisted into a zigzag. How about the character ³2² [jen, 
meaning men]? It became ³4², with three slanting strokes added

59 OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
to its right leg. The comrade who wrote this was no doubt a disciple 
of the ancient scholars, but it is rather baffling why he should have 
written such characters in such a place, on the Yenan city wall, at 
the time of the War of Resistance. Perhaps he had taken a vow that 
the common people should not read them; it is difficult to explain 
otherwise. Communists who really want to do propaganda must 
consider their audience and bear in mind those who will read their 
articles and slogans or listen to their speeches and their talk; otherwise 
they are in effect resolving not to be read or listened to by 
anyone. Many people often take it for granted that what they write 
and say can be easily understood by everybody, when it is not so at 
all. How can people understand them when they write and speak 
in Party stereotypes? The saying ³to play the lute to a cow² implies 
a gibe at the audience. If we substitute the idea of respect for the 
audience, the gibe is turned against the player. Why should he strum 
away without considering his audience? What is worse, he is producing 
a Party stereotype as raucous as a crow, and yet he insists 
on cawing at the masses. When shooting an arrow, one must aim 
at the target; when playing the lute, one must consider the listener; 
how, then, can one write articles or make speeches without taking 
the reader or the audience into account? Suppose we want to make 
friends with a person, whoever he may be, can we become bosom 
friends if we cannot understand each other¹s hearts, do not know 
each other¹s thoughts? It simply will not do for our propaganda 
workers to rattle on without investigating, studying and analysing 
their audience. 
The fourth indictment against stereotyped Party writing is 
its drab language that reminds one of a piehsan. Like our stereotyped 
Party writing, the creatures known in Shanghai as ³little piehsan² 
are wizened and ugly. If an article or a speech merely rings the changes 
on a few terms in a classroom tone without a shred of vigour or spirit, 
is it not rather like a piehsan, drab of speech and repulsive in appearance? 
If someone enters primary school at seven, goes to middle 
school in his teens, graduates from college in his twenties and never 
has contact with the masses of the people, he is not to blame if his 
language is poor and monotonous. But we are revolutionaries working 
for the masses, and if we do not learn the language of the masses, 
we cannot work well. At present many of our comrades doing propaganda 
work make no study of language. Their propaganda is very 
dull and few people care to read their articles or listen to their talk.

60 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Why do we need to study language and, what is more, spend much 
effort on it? Because the mastery of language is not easy and requires 
painstaking effort. First, let us learn language from the masses. The 
people¹s vocabulary is rich, vigorous, vivid and expressive of real 
life. It is because many of us have not mastered language that our 
articles and speeches contain few vigorous, vivid and effective expressions 
and resemble not a hale and healthy person, but an emaciated 
piehsan, a mere bag of bones. Secondly, let us absorb what we need 
from foreign languages. We should not import foreign expressions 
mechanically or use them indiscriminately, but should absorb what 
is good and suits our needs. Our current vocabulary has already 
incorporated many foreign expressions, because the old Chinese 
vocabulary was inadequate. For instance, today we are holding a meeting 
of kanpu [cadres], and the term kanpu is derived from a foreign 
word. We should continue to absorb many fresh things from abroad, 
not only progressive ideas but new expressions as well. Thirdly, let 
us also learn whatever is alive in the classical Chinese language. 
Since we have not studied classical Chinese hard enough, we have 
not made full and proper use of much that is still alive in it. Of course, 
we are resolutely opposed to the use of obsolete expressions or 
allusions, and that is final; but what is good and still useful should 
be taken over. Those who are badly infected by stereotyped Party 
writing do not take pains to study what is useful in the language of 
the people, in foreign languages, or in classical Chinese, so the masses 
do not welcome their dry and dull propaganda, and we too have 
no need for such poor and incompetent propagandists. Who are our 
propagandists? They include not only teachers, journalists, writers 
and artists, but all our cadres. Take the military commanders, for 
instance. Though they make no public statements, they have to talk 
to the soldiers and have dealings with the people. What is this if 
not propaganda? Whenever a man speaks to others, he is doing 
propaganda work. Unless he is dumb, he always has a few words 
to say. It is therefore imperative that our comrades should all study 
language. 
The fifth indictment against stereotyped Party writing is that 
it arranges items under a complicated set of headings, as if starting 
a Chinese pharmacy. Go and take a look at any Chinese pharmacy, 
and you will see cabinets with numerous drawers, each bearing the 
name of a drug  toncal, foxglove, rhubarb, saltpetre . . . indeed, 
everything that should be there. This method has been picked up by

61 OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
our comrades. In their articles and speeches, their books and reports, 
they use first the big Chinese numerals, second the small Chinese 
numerals, third the characters for the ten celestial stems, fourth the 
characters for the twelve earthly branches, and then capital A, B, C, D, 
then small a, b, c, d, followed by the Arabic numerals, and what not! 
How fortunate that the ancients and the foreigners created all these 
symbols for us so that we can start a Chinese pharmacy without the 
slightest effort. For all its verbiage, an article that bristles with such 
symbols, that does not pose, analyse or solve problems and that does 
not take a stand for or against anything is devoid of real content 
and nothing but a Chinese pharmacy. I am not saying that such 
symbols as the ten celestial stems, etc., should not be used, but that 
this kind of approach to problems is wrong. The method borrowed 
from the Chinese pharmacy, which many of our comrades are very 
fond of, is really the most crude, infantile and philistine of all. It is 
a formalist method, classifying things according to their external 
features instead of their internal relations. If one takes a conglomeration 
of concepts that are not internally related and arranges them 
into an article, speech or report simply according to the external 
features of things, then one is juggling with concepts and may also 
lead others to indulge in the same sort of game, with the result that 
they do not use their brains to think over problems and probe into 
the essence of things, but are satisfied merely to list phenomena in 
ABCD order. What is a problem? A problem is the contradiction in 
a thing. Where one has an unresolved contradiction, there one has a 
problem. Since there is a problem, you have to be for one side and 
against the other, and you have to pose the problem. To pose the 
problem, you must first make a preliminary investigation and study of 
the two basic aspects of the problem or contradiction before you can 
understand the nature of the contradiction. This is the process of 
discovering the problem. Preliminary investigation and study can 
discover the problem, can pose the problem, but cannot as yet solve 
it. In order to solve the problem it is necessary to make a systematic 
and thorough investigation and study. This is the process of analysis. 
In posing the problem too, analysis is needed, otherwise, faced with 
a chaotic and bewildering mass of phenomena, you will not be able 
to discern where the problem or contradiction lies. But here, by the 
process of analysis we mean a process of systematic and thorough 
analysis. It often happens that although a problem has been posed 
it cannot be solved because the internal relations of things have not

62 MAO TSE-TUNG 
yet been revealed, because this process of systematic and thorough 
analysis has not yet been carried out; consequently we still cannot 
see the contours of the problem clearly, cannot make a synthesis and 
so cannot solve the problem well. If an article or speech is important 
and meant to give guidance, it ought to pose a particular problem, 
then analyse it and then make a synthesis pointing to the nature of 
the problem and providing the method for solving it; in all this, 
formalist methods are useless. Since infantile, crude, philistine and 
lazy-minded formalist methods are prevalent in our Party, we must 
expose them; only thus can everybody learn to use the Marxist method 
to observe, pose, analyse and solve problems; only thus can we do our 
work well and only thus can our revolutionary cause triumph. 
The sixth indictment against stereotyped Party writing is that 
it is irresponsible and harms people wherever it appears. All the 
offences mentioned above are due partly to immaturity and partly 
to an insufficient sense of responsibility. Let us take washing the face 
to illustrate the point. We all wash our faces every day, many of 
us more than once, and inspect ourselves in the mirror afterwards 
by way of ³investigation and study² (loud laughter), for fear that 
something may not be quite right. What a great sense of responsibility! 
If we wrote articles and made speeches with the same sense 
of responsibility, we would not be doing badly. Do not present 
what is not presentable. Always bear in mind that it may influence 
the thoughts and actions of others. If a man happens not to wash 
his face for a day or two, that of course is not good, and if after 
washing he leaves a smudge or two, that too is not so pleasing, but 
there is no serious danger. It is different with writing articles or 
making speeches; they are intended solely to influence others. Yet 
our comrades go about this task casually; this means putting the 
trivial above the important. Many people write articles and make 
speeches without prior study or preparation, and after writing an 
article, they do not bother to go over it several times in the same 
way as they would examine their faces in the mirror after washing, 
but instead offhandedly send it to be published. Often the result is 
³A thousand words from the pen in a stream, but ten thousand li 
away from the theme². Talented though these writers may appear, 
they actually harm people. This bad habit, this weak sense of responsibility, 
must be corrected. 
The seventh indictment against stereotyped Party writing is that 
it poisons the whole Party and jeopardizes the revolution. The eighth

63 OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
indictment is that its spread would wreck the country and ruin the 
people. These two indictments are self-evident and require no elaboration. 
In other words, if stereotyped Party writing is not transformed 
but is allowed to develop unchecked, the consequences will be very 
serious indeed. The poison of subjectivism and sectarianism is hidden 
in stereotyped Party writing, and if this poison spreads it will endanger 
both the Party and the country. 
The aforesaid eight counts are our call to arms against stereotyped 
Party writing. 
As a form, the Party stereotype is not only unsuitable for expressing 
the revolutionary spirit but is apt to stifle it. To develop 
the revolutionary spirit it is necessary to discard stereotyped Party 
writing and instead to adopt the Marxist-Leninist style of writing, 
which is vigorous, lively, fresh and forceful. This style of writing has 
existed for a long time, but is yet to be enriched and spread widely 
among us. When we have destroyed foreign stereotyped writing and 
stereotyped Party writing, we can enrich our new style of writing and 
spread it widely, thereby advancing the Party¹s revolutionary cause. 
The Party stereotype is not only confined to articles and speeches, 
but is also found in the conduct of meetings. ³1. Opening announcement; 
2. report; 3. discussion; 4. conclusions; and 5. adjournment.² If 
this rigid procedure is followed at every meeting, large or small, 
everywhere and every time, is not that another Party stereotype? 
When ³reports² are made at meetings they often go as follows: 
³1. the international situation; 2. the domestic situation; 3. the Border 
Region; and 4. our own department²; and the meetings often last 
from morning till night, with even those having nothing to say taking 
the floor, as though they would let the others down unless they spoke. 
In short, there is a disregard for actual conditions and deadly adherence 
to rigid old forms and habits. Should we not correct all these 
things too? 
Nowadays many people are calling for a transformation to a 
national, scientific and mass style. That is very good. But ³transformation² 
means thorough change, from top to bottom and inside out. 
Yet some people who have not made even a slight change are calling 
for a transformation. I would therefore advise these comrades to 
begin by making just a little change before they go on to ³transform², 
or else they will remain entangled in dogmatism and stereotyped 
Party writing. This can be described as having grandiose aims but 
puny abilities, great ambition but little talent, and it will accomplish

64 MAO TSE-TUNG 
nothing. So whoever talks glibly about ³transformation to a mass 
style² while in fact he is stuck fast in his own small circle had better 
watch out, or some day one of the masses may bump into him along 
the road and say, ³What about all this transformation¹, sir? Can I 
see a bit of it, please?² and he will be in a fix. If he is not just prating 
but sincerely wants to transform to a mass style, he must really go 
among the common people and learn from them, otherwise his ³transformation² 
will remain up in the air. There are some who keep 
clamouring for transformation to a mass style but cannot speak three 
sentences in the language of the common people. It shows they are 
not really determined to learn from the masses. Their minds are still 
confined to their own small circles. 
At this meeting copies of A Guide to Propaganda, a pamphlet 
containing four articles, have been distributed, and I advise our comrades 
to read and re-read it. 
The first piece, composed of excerpts from the History of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), Short Course, 
deals with the way Lenin did propaganda work. It describes, among 
other things, how Lenin wrote leaflets: 
Under Lenin¹s guidance, the St. Petersburg League of Struggle 
for the Emancipation of the Working Class was the first body 
in Russia that began to unite Socialism with the working-class 
movement. When a strike broke out in some factory, the League 
of Struggle, which through the members of its circles was kept 
well posted on the state of affairs in the factories, immediately 
responded by issuing leaflets and Socialist proclamations. These 
leaflets exposed the oppression of the workers by the manufacturers, 
explained how the workers should fight for their interests, 
and set forth the workers¹ demands. The leaflets told the plain 
truth about the ulcers of capitalism, the poverty of the workers, 
their intolerably hard working day of 12 to 14 hours, and their 
utter lack of rights. They also put forward appropriate political 
demands. 
Take note, ³well posted² and ³told the plain truth²! Again: 
With the collaboration of the worker Babushkin, Lenin at the 
end of 1894 wrote the first agitational leaflet of this kind and 
an appeal to the workers of the Semyannikov Works in St. Petersburg 
who were on strike.

65 OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
To write a leaflet, you must consult with comrades who are well 
posted on the state of affairs. It was on the basis of such investigation 
and study that Lenin wrote and worked. 
Every leaflet greatly helped to stiffen the spirit of the workers. 
They saw that the Socialists were helping and defending them.4 
Do we agree with Lenin? If we do, we must work in the spirit 
of Lenin. That is, we must do as Lenin did and not fill endless pages 
with verbiage, or shoot at random without considering the audience, 
or become self-opinionated and bombastic. 
The second piece is composed of excerpts from Dimitrov¹s statements 
at the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International. 
What did Dimitrov say? He said: 
We must learn to talk to the masses, not in the language of 
book formulas, but in the language of fighters for the cause of the 
masses, whose every word, whose every idea reflects the innermost 
thoughts and sentiments of millions.5 
And again: 
. . . the masses cannot assimilate our decisions unless we learn 
to speak the language which the masses understand. 
We do not always know how to speak simply, concretely, in 
images which are familiar and intelligible to the masses. We are 
still unable to refrain from abstract formulas which we have 
learned by rote. As a matter of fact, if you look through our 
leaflets, newspapers, resolutions and theses, you will find that they 
are often written in a language and style so heavy that they are 
difficult for even our Party functionaries to understand, let alone 
the rank-and-file workers.6 
Well? Does not Dimitrov put his finger on our weak spot? Apparently, 
stereotyped Party writing exists in foreign countries as well 
as in China, so you can see it is a common disease. (Laughter.) In any 
case, we should cure our own disease quickly in accordance with 
Comrade Dimitrov¹s injunction. 
Every one of us must make this a law, a Bolshevik law, an 
elementary rule: 
When writing or speaking always have in mind the rankand-
file worker who must understand you, must believe in your

66 MAO TSE-TUNG 
appeal and be ready to follow you! You must have in mind 
for whom you write, to whom you speak.7 
This is the prescription made out for us by the Communist International, 
a prescription that must be followed. Let it be a law for us! 
The third article, selected from the Complete Works of Lu Hsun, 
is the author¹s reply to the magazine The Dipper,8 discussing how to 
write. What did Lu Hsun say? Altogether he set forth eight rules of 
writing, some of which I shall pick out for comment here. 
Rule 1: ³Pay close attention to all manner of things; observe 
more, and if you have observed only a little, then do not write.² 
What he says is, ³pay close attention to all manner of things², 
not just to one thing or half a thing. He says ³observe more², not 
just take a look or half a look. How about us? Don¹t we often do 
exactly the opposite and write after having observed only a little? 
Rule 2: ³Do not force yourself to write when you have nothing 
to say.² 
What about us? Don¹t we often force ourselves to write a great 
deal when it is all too clear that there is nothing in our heads? It is 
sheer irresponsibility to pick up the pen and ³force ourselves to write² 
without investigation or study. 
Rule 4: ³After writing something, read it over twice at least, 
and do your utmost to strike out non-essential words, sentences 
and paragraphs, without the slightest compunction. Rather condense 
the material for a novel into a sketch, never spin out the 
material for a sketch into a novel.² 
Confucius advised, ³Think twice²,9 and Han Yu said, ³A deed 
is accomplished through taking thought.²10 That was in ancient times. 
Today matters have become very complicated, and sometimes it is 
not even enough to think them over three or four times. Lu Hsun 
said, ³Read it over twice at least.² And at most? He did not say, 
but in my opinion it does no harm to go over an important article 
more than ten times and to revise it conscientiously before it is 
published. Articles are the reflection of objective reality, which is 
intricate and complex and must be studied over and over again before 
it can be properly reflected; to be slipshod in this respect is to be 
ignorant of the rudiments of writing.

67 OPPOSE STEREOTYPED PARTY WRITING 
Rule 6: ³Do not coin adjectives or other terms that are 
intelligible to nobody but yourself.² 
We have ³coined² too many expressions that are ³intelligible 
to nobody². Sometimes a single clause runs to forty or fifty words 
and is packed with ³adjectives or other terms that are intelligible 
to nobody². Many who never tire of professing to follow Lu Hsun 
are the very ones who turn their backs on him! 
The last piece is taken from the report on how to develop a national 
style of propaganda, which was adopted at the Sixth Plenary 
Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China. At that session held in 1938, we said that ³any talk about 
Marxism apart from China¹s specific characteristics is only Marxism 
in the abstract, Marxism in a vacuum². That is to say, we must 
oppose all empty talk about Marxism, and Communists living in 
China must study Marxism by linking it with the realities of the 
Chinese revolution. 
The report said: 
Foreign stereotypes must be abolished, there must be less 
singing of empty, abstract tunes, and dogmatism must be laid 
to rest; they must be replaced by the fresh, lively Chinese style 
and spirit which the common people of China love. To separate 
internationalist content from national form is the practice of those 
who do not understand the first thing about internationalism. 
We, on the contrary, must link the two closely. In this matter 
there are serious errors in our ranks which should be conscientiously 
overcome. 
The abolition of foreign stereotypes was demanded in that report, 
yet some comrades are still promoting them. Less singing of empty, 
abstract tunes was demanded, yet some comrades are obstinately 
singing more. The demand was made that dogmatism be laid to 
rest, yet some comrades are telling it to get out of bed. In short, 
many people have let this report which was adopted at the Sixth 
Plenary Session go in one ear and out of the other, as if wilfully 
opposed to it. 
The Central Committee has now made the decision that we must 
discard stereotyped Party writing, dogmatism and the like once and 
or all, and that is why I have come and talked at some length. I 
hope that comrades will think over and analyse what I have said

68 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and that each comrade will also analyse his own particular case. 
Everyone should carefully examine himself, talk over with his close 
friends and the comrades around him whatever he has clarified and 
really get rid of his own defects.

p. 50 of this volume. 
2 Opposition to stereotyped writing, whether old or new, runs all through Lu 
Hsun¹s works. The foreign stereotype was developed after the May 4th Movement 
by some shallow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals and, disseminated by 
them, existed for a long time among revolutionary cultural workers. In a number of 
essays, Lu Hsun fought against the foreign stereotype as found in their ranks and 
condemned it in these terms: 
A clean sweep should be made of all stereotyped writings, whether old 
or new. . . . For instance, it is also a kind of stereotype if all one can do is 
to ³hurl insults², ³threaten² or even ³pass sentence² and merely copy old 
formulas and apply these indiscriminately to every fact, instead of specifically 
and concretely using formulas derived from science to interpret the new facts 
and phenomena which emerge every day. (³A Reply to Chu Hsiu-hsia¹s Letter², 
appended to ³Giving the Show Away².)

TALKS AT THE YENAN FORUM 
ON LITERATURE AND ART 
May 1942
INTRODUCTION 
May 2, 1942
Comrades! You have been invited to this forum today to exchange 
ideas and examine the relationship between work in the 
literary and artistic fields and revolutionary work in general. Our 
aim is to ensure that revolutionary literature and art follow the 
correct path of development and provide better help to other revolutionary 
work in facilitating the overthrow of our national enemy and 
the accomplishment of the task of national liberation. 
In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people there are 
various fronts, among which there are the fronts of the pen and of 
the gun, the cultural and the military fronts. To defeat the enemy 
we must rely primarily on the army with guns. But this army alone 
is not enough; we must also have a cultural army, which is absolutely 
indispensable for uniting our own ranks and defeating the enemy. 
Since the May 4th Movement such a cultural army has taken shape 
in China, and it has helped the Chinese revolution, gradually reduced 
the domain of China¹s feudal culture and of the comprador culture 
which serves imperialist aggression, and weakened their influence. 
To oppose the new culture the Chinese reactionaries can now only 
³pit quantity against quality². In other words, reactionaries have 
money, and though they can produce nothing good, they can go all 
out and produce in quantity. Literature and art have been an important 
and successful part of the cultural front since the May 4th 
Movement. During the ten years¹ civil war, the revolutionary literature 
and art movement grew greatly. That movement and the 
revolutionary war both headed in the same general direction, but 
69

70 MAO TSE-TUNG 
these two fraternal armies were not linked together in their practical 
work because the reactionaries had cut them off from each other. 
It is very good that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance 
Against Japan, more and more revolutionary writers and artists 
have been coming to Yenan and our other anti-Japanese base areas. 
But it does not necessarily follow that, having come to the base areas, 
they have already integrated themselves completely with the masses 
of the people here. The two must be completely integrated if we 
are to push ahead with our revolutionary work. The purpose of our 
meeting today is precisely to ensure that literature and art fit well 
into the whole revolutionary machine as a component part, that they 
operate as powerful weapons for uniting and educating the people 
and for attacking and destroying the enemy, and that they help the 
people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind. What are the 
problems that must be solved to achieve this objective? I think they 
are the problems of the class stand of the writers and artists, their 
attitude, their audience, their work and their study. 
The problem of class stand. Our stand is that of the proletariat 
and of the masses. For members of the Communist Party, this means 
keeping to the stand of the Party, keeping to Party spirit and Party 
policy. Are there any of our literary and art workers who are still 
mistaken or not clear in their understanding of this problem? I think 
there are. Many of our comrades have frequently departed from the 
correct stand. 
The problem of attitude. From one¹s stand there follow specific 
attitudes towards specific matters. For instance, is one to extol or 
to expose? This is a question of attitude. Which attitude is wanted? 
I would say both. The question is, whom are you dealing with? 
There are three kinds of persons, the enemy, our allies in the united 
front and our own people; the last are the masses and their vanguard. 
We need to adopt a different attitude towards each of the three. With 
regard to the enemy, that is, Japanese imperialism and all the other 
enemies of the people, the task of revolutionary writers and artists 
is to expose their duplicity and cruelty and at the same time to point 
out the inevitability of their defeat, so as to encourage the anti- 
Japanese army and people to fight staunchly with one heart and one 
mind for their overthrow. With regard to our different allies in the 
united front, our attitude should be one of both alliance and criticism, 
and there should be different kinds of alliance and different kinds 
of criticism. We support them in their resistance to Japan and praise

71 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
them for any achievement. But if the are not active in the War of 
Resistance, we should criticize them. If anyone opposes the Communist 
Party and the people and keeps moving down the path of 
reaction, we will firmly oppose him. As for the masses of the people, 
their toil and their struggle, their army and their Party, we should 
certainly praise them. The people, too, have their shortcomings. 
Among the proletariat many retain petty-bourgeois ideas, while both 
the peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie have backward ideas; 
these are burdens hampering them in their struggle. We should be 
patient and spend a long time in educating them and helping them 
to get these loads off their backs and combat their own shortcomings 
and errors, so that they can advance with great strides. They have 
remoulded themselves in struggle or are doing so, and our literature 
and art should depict this process. As long as they do not persist in 
their errors, we should not dwell on their negative side and consequently 
make the mistake of ridiculing them or, worse still, of being hostile to 
them. Our writings should help them to unite, to make progress, to press 
ahead with one heart and one mind, to discard what is backward 
and develop what is revolutionary, and should certainly not do the 
opposite. 
The problem of audience, i.e., the people for whom our works of 
literature and art are produced. In the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region and the anti-Japanese base areas of northern and central 
China, this problem differs from that in the Kuomintang areas, and 
differs still more from that in Shanghai before the War of Resistance. 
In the Shanghai period, the audience for works of revolutionary 
literature and art consisted mainly of a section of the students, office 
workers and shop assistants. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance 
the audience in the Kuomintang areas became somewhat 
wider, but it still consisted mainly of the same kind of people because 
the government there prevented the workers, peasants and soldiers 
from having access to revolutionary literature and art. In our base 
areas the situation is entirely different. Here the audience for works 
of literature and art consists of workers, peasants, soldiers and revolutionary 
cadres. There are students in the base areas, too, but they 
are different from students of the old type; they are either former 
or future cadres. The cadres of all types, fighters in the army, workers 
in the factories and peasants in the villages all want to read books 
and newspapers once they become literate, and those who are illiterate 
want to see plays and operas, look at drawings and paintings, sing

72 MAO TSE-TUNG 
songs and hear music; they are the audience for our works of literature 
and art. Take the cadres alone. Do not think they are few; 
they far outnumber the readers of any book published in the Kuomintang 
areas. There, an edition usually runs to only 2,000 copies, 
and even three editions add up to only 6,000; but as for the cadres 
in the base areas, in Yenan alone there are more than 10,000 who 
read books. Many of them, moreover, are tempered revolutionaries 
of long standing, who have come from all parts of the country and 
will go out to work in different places, so it is very important to do 
educational work among them. Our literary and art workers must do 
a good job in this respect. 
Since the audience for our literature and art consists of workers, 
peasants and soldiers and of their cadres, the problem arises of 
understanding them and knowing them well. A great deal of work 
has to be done in order to understand them and know them well, to 
understand and know well all the different kinds of people and 
phenomena in the Party and government organizations, in the villages 
and factories and in the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies. Our 
writers and artists have their literary and art work to do, but their 
primary task is to understand people and know them well. In this 
regard, how have matters stood with our writers and artists? I would 
say they have been lacking in knowledge and understanding; they 
have been like ³a hero with no place to display his prowess². What 
does lacking in knowledge mean? Not knowing people well. The 
writers and artists do not have a good knowledge either of those 
whom they describe or of their audience; indeed they may hardly 
know them at all. They do not know the workers or peasants or 
soldiers well, and do not know the cadres well either. What does 
lacking in understanding mean? Not understanding the language, 
that is, not being familiar with the rich, lively language of the masses. 
Since many writers and artists stand aloof from the masses and lead 
empty lives, naturally they are unfamiliar with the language of the 
people. Accordingly, their works are not only insipid in language but 
often contain nondescript expressions of their own coining which run 
counter to popular usage. Many comrades like to talk about ³a mass 
style². But what does it really mean? It means that the thoughts and 
feelings of our writers and artists should be fused with those of the 
masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. To achieve this fusion, they 
should conscientiously learn the language of the masses. How can you 
talk of literary and artistic creation if you find the very language of

73 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
the masses largely incomprehensible? By ³a hero with no place to 
display his prowess², we mean that your collection of great truths is 
not appreciated by the masses. The more you put on the airs of a 
veteran before the masses and play the ³hero², the more you try to 
peddle such stuff to the masses, the less likely they are to accept it. 
If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to be one with 
the masses, you must make up your mind to undergo a long and even 
painful process of tempering. Here I might mention the experience 
of how my own feelings changed. I began life as a student and at 
school acquired the ways of a student; I then used to feel it undignified 
to do even a little manual labour, such as carrying my own 
luggage in the presence of my fellow students, who were incapable 
of carrying anything, either on their shoulders or in their hands. At 
that time I felt that intellectuals were the only clean people in the 
world, while in comparison workers and peasants were dirty. I did 
not mind wearing the clothes of other intellectuals, believing them 
clean, but I would not put on clothes belonging to a worker or peasant, 
believing them dirty. But after I became a revolutionary and 
lived with workers and peasants and with soldiers of the revolutionary 
army, I gradually came to know them well, and they gradually 
came to know me well too. It was then, and only then, that I 
fundamentally changed the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois feelings 
implanted in me in the bourgeois schools. I came to feel that compared 
with the workers and peasants the unremoulded intellectuals were 
not clean and that, in the last analysis, the workers and peasants were 
the cleanest people and, even though their hands were soiled and 
their feet smeared with cow-dung, they were really cleaner than the 
bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. That is what is meant by 
a change in feelings, a change from one class to another. If our writers 
and artists who come from the intelligentsia want their works to be 
well received by the masses, they must change and remould their 
thinking and their feelings. Without such a change, without such 
remoulding, they can do nothing well and will be misfits. 
The last problem is study, by which I mean the study of Marxism- 
Leninism and of society. Anyone who considers himself a revolutionary 
Marxist writer, and especially any writer who is a member of the 
Communist Party, must have a knowledge of Marxism-Leninism. At 
present, however, some comrades are lacking in the basic concepts 
of Marxism. For instance, it is a basic Marxist concept that being 
determines consciousness, that the objective realities of class struggle

74 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and national struggle determine our thoughts and feelings. But some 
of our comrades turn this upside down and maintain that everything 
ought to start from ³love². Now as for love, in a class society there 
can be only class love; but these comrades are seeking a love transcending 
classes, love in the abstract and also freedom in the abstract, 
truth in the abstract, human nature in the abstract, etc. This shows 
that they have been very deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie. They 
should thoroughly rid themselves of this influence and modestly study 
Marxism-Leninism. It is right for writers and artists to study literary 
and artistic creation, but the science of Marxism-Leninism must be 
studied by all revolutionaries, writers and artists not excepted. Writers 
and artists should study society, that is to say, should study the 
various classes in society, their mutual relations and respective conditions, 
their physiognomy and their psychology. Only when we grasp 
all this clearly can we have a literature and art that is rich in content 
and correct in orientation. 
I am merely raising these problems today by way of introduction; 
I hope all of you will express your views on these and other relevant 
problems. 
CONCLUSION 
May 23, 1942
Comrades! Our forum has had three meetings this month. In the 
pursuit of truth we have carried on spirited debates in which scores 
of Party and non-Party comrades have spoken, laying bare the issues 
and making them more concrete. This, I believe, will very much 
benefit the whole literary and artistic movement. 
In discussing a problem, we should start from reality and not 
from definitions. We would be following a wrong method if we first 
looked up definitions of literature and art in textbooks and then used 
them to determine the guiding principles for the present-day literary 
and artistic movement and to judge the different opinions and controversies 
that arise today. We are Marxists, and Marxism teaches 
that in our approach to a problem we should start from objective 
facts, not from abstract definitions, and that we should derive our 
guiding principles, policies and measures from an analysis of these 
facts. We should do the same in our present discussion of literary and 
artistic work.

75 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
What are the facts at present? The facts are: the War of Resistance 
Against Japan which China has been fighting for five years; the 
world-wide anti-fascist war; the vacillations of China¹s big landlord 
class and big bourgeoisie in the War of Resistance and their policy 
of high-handed oppression of the people; the revolutionary movement 
in literature and art since the May 4th Movement  its great 
contributions to the revolution during the last twenty-three years and 
its many shortcomings; the anti-Japanese democratic base areas of 
the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and the integration of 
large numbers of writers and artists with these armies and with the 
workers and peasants in these areas; the difference in both environment 
and tasks between the writers and artists in the base areas and 
those in the Kuomintang areas; and the controversial issues concerning 
literature and art which have arisen in Yenan and the other 
anti-Japanese base areas. These are the actual, undeniable facts in 
the light of which we have to consider our problems. 
What then is the crux of the matter? In my opinion, it consists 
fundamentally of the problems of working for the masses and how 
to work for the masses. Unless these two problems are solved, or 
solved properly, our writers and artists will be ill-adapted to their 
environment and their tasks and will come up against a series of 
difficulties from without and within. My concluding remarks will 
centre on these two problems and also touch upon some related ones. 
I 
The first problem is: literature and art for whom? 
This problem was solved long ago by Marxists, especially by 
Lenin. As far back as 1905 Lenin pointed out emphatically that our 
literature and art should ³serve . . . the millions and tens of millions 
of working people².1 For comrades engaged in literary and artistic 
work in the anti-Japanese base areas it might seem that this problem 
is already solved and needs no further discussion. Actually, that is 
not the case. Many comrades have not found a clear solution. Consequently 
their sentiments, their works, their actions and their views 
on the guiding principles for literature and art have inevitably been 
more or less at variance with the needs of the masses and of the 
practical struggle. Of course, among the numerous men of culture, 
writers, artists and other literary and artistic workers engaged in 
the great struggle for liberation together with the Communist Party

and the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies, a few may be 
careerists who are with us only temporarily, but the overwhelming 
majority are working energetically for the common cause. By relying 
on these comrades, we have achieved a great deal in our literature, 
drama, music and fine arts. Many of these writers and artists have 
begun their work since the outbreak of the War of Resistance; many 
others did much revolutionary work before the war, endured many 
hardships and influenced broad masses of the people by their activities 
and works. Why do we say, then, that even among these comrades 
there are some who have not reached a clear solution of the problem 
of whom literature and art are for? Is it conceivable that there are 
still some who maintain that revolutionary literature and art are 
not for the masses of the people but for the exploiters and oppressors? 
Indeed literature and art exist which are for the exploiters and 
oppressors. Literature and art for the landlord class are feudal literature 
and art. Such were the literature and art of the ruling class in 
China¹s feudal era. To this day such literature and art still have 
considerable influence in China. Literature and art for the bourgeoisie 
are bourgeois literature and art. People like Liang Shih-chiu,2 
whom Lu Hsun criticized, talk about literature and art as transcending 
classes, but in fact they uphold bourgeois literature and art and 
oppose proletarian literature and art. Then literature and art exist 
which serve the imperialists  for example, the works of Chou Tsojen, 
Chang Tzu-ping3 and their like  which we call traitor literature 
and art. With us, literature and art are for the people, not for 
any of the above groups. We have said that China¹s new culture at 
the present stage is an anti-imperialist, anti-feudal culture of the 
masses of the people under the leadership of the proletariat. Today, 
anything that is truly of the masses must necessarily be led by the 
proletariat. Whatever is under the leadership of the bourgeoisie cannot 
possibly be of the masses. Naturally, the same applies to the 
new literature and art which are part of the new culture. We should 
take over the rich legacy and the good traditions in literature and 
art that have been handed down from past ages in China and foreign 
countries, but the aim must still be to serve the masses of the people. 
Nor do we refuse to utilize the literary and artistic forms of the past, 
but in our hands these old forms, remoulded and infused with new content, 
also become something revolutionary in the service of the people. 
Who, then, are the masses of the people? The broadest sections 
of the people, constituting more than 90 per cent of our total popula

77 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
tion, are the workers, peasants, soldiers and urban petty bourgeoisie. 
Therefore, our literature and art are first for the workers, the class 
that leads the revolution. Secondly, they are for the peasants, the 
most numerous and most steadfast of our allies in the revolution. 
Thirdly, they are for the armed workers and peasants, namely, the 
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and the other armed units 
of the people, which are the main forces of the revolutionary war. 
Fourthly, they are for the labouring masses of the urban petty bourgeoisie 
and for the petty-bourgeois intellectuals, both of whom are also 
our allies in the revolution and capable of long-term co-operation 
with us. These four kinds of people constitute the overwhelming 
majority of the Chinese nation, the broadest masses of the people. 
Our literature and art should be for the four kinds of people 
we have enumerated. To serve them, we must take the class stand 
of the proletariat and not that of the petty bourgeoisie. Today, writers 
who cling to an individualist, petty-bourgeois stand cannot truly serve 
the masses of revolutionary workers, peasants and soldiers. Their 
interest is mainly focused on the small number of petty-bourgeois 
intellectuals. This is the crucial reason why some of our comrades 
cannot correctly solve the problem of ³for whom?² In saying this 
I am not referring to theory. In theory, or in words, no one in 
our ranks regards the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers as 
less important than the petty-bourgeois intellectuals. I am referring 
to practice, to action. In practice, in action, do they regard pettybourgeois 
intellectuals as more important than workers, peasants and 
soldiers? I think they do. Many comrades concern themselves with 
studying the petty-bourgeois intellectuals and analysing their psychology, 
and they concentrate on portraying these intellectuals and 
excusing or defending their shortcomings, instead of guiding the 
intellectuals to join with them in getting closer to the masses of 
workers, peasants and soldiers, taking part in the practical struggles 
of the masses, portraying and educating the masses. Coming from 
the petty bourgeoisie and being themselves intellectuals, many comrades 
seek friends only among intellectuals and concentrate on 
studying and describing them. Such study and description are proper 
if done from a proletarian position. But that is not what they do, or not 
what they do fully. They take the petty-bourgeois stand and produce 
works that are the self-expression of the petty bourgeoisie, as can be 
seen in quite a number of literary and artistic products. Often they 
show heartfelt sympathy for intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin,

78 MAO TSE-TUNG 
to the extent of sympathizing with or even praising their shortcomings. 
On the other hand, these comrades seldom come into contact 
with the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, do not understand 
or study them, do not have intimate friends among them and are 
not good at portraying them; when they do depict them, the clothes 
are the clothes of working people but the faces are those of pettybourgeois 
intellectuals. In certain respects they are fond of the 
workers, peasants and soldiers and the cadres stemming from them; 
but there are times when they do not like them and there are some 
respects in which they do not like them: they do not like their feelings 
or their manner or their nascent literature and art (the wall newspapers, 
murals, folk songs, folk tales, etc.). At times they are fond 
of these things too, but that is when they are hunting for novelty, 
for something with which to embellish their own works, or even for 
certain backward features. At other times they openly despise these 
things and are partial to what belongs to the petty-bourgeois intellectuals 
or even to the bourgeoisie. These comrades have their feet 
planted on the side of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals; or, to put 
it more elegantly, their innermost soul is still a kingdom of the pettybourgeois 
intelligentsia. Thus they have not yet solved, or not yet 
clearly solved, the problem of ³for whom?² This applies not only 
to newcomers to Yenan; even among comrades who have been to 
the front and worked for a number of years in our base areas and 
in the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies, many have not completely 
solved this problem. It requires a long period of time, at least 
eight or ten years, to solve it thoroughly. But however long it takes, 
solve it we must and solve it unequivocally and thoroughly. Our 
literary and art workers must accomplish this task and shift their 
stand; they must gradually move their feet over to the side of the 
workers, peasants and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat, through 
the process of going into their very midst and into the thick of practical 
struggles and through the process of studying Marxism and society. 
Only in this way can we have a literature and art that are truly for 
the workers, peasants and soldiers, a truly proletarian literature 
and art. 
This question of ³for whom?² is fundamental; it is a question 
of principle. The controversies and divergences, the opposition and 
disunity arising among some comrades in the past were not on this 
fundamental question of principle but on secondary questions, or even 
on issues involving no principle. On this question of principle, how

79 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
ever, there has been hardly any divergence between the two contending 
sides and they have shown almost complete agreement; 
to some extent, both tend to look down upon the workers, peasants 
and soldiers and divorce themselves from the masses. I say ³to some 
extent² because, generally speaking, these comrades do not look 
down upon the workers, peasants and soldiers or divorce themselves 
from the masses in the same way as the Kuomintang does. 
Nevertheless, the tendency is there. Unless this fundamental problem 
is solved, many other problems will not be easy to solve. Take, for 
instance, the sectarianism in literary and art circles. This too is a 
question of principle, but sectarianism can only be eradicated by 
putting forward and faithfully applying the slogans, ³For the workers 
and peasants!², ³For the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies!² 
and ³Go among the masses!² Otherwise the problem of sectarianism 
can never be solved. Lu Hsun once said: 
A common aim is the prerequisite for a united front. . . . The 
fact that our front is not united shows that we have not been 
able to unify our aims, and that some people are working only 
for small groups or indeed only for themselves. If we all aim at 
serving the masses of workers and peasants, our front will of 
course be united.4 
The problem existed then in Shanghai; now it exists in Chungking 
too. In such places the problem can hardly be solved thoroughly, 
because the rulers oppress the revolutionary writers and artists and 
deny them the freedom to go out among the masses of workers, 
peasants and soldiers. Here with us the situation is entirely different. 
We encourage revolutionary writers and artists to be active in forming 
intimate contacts with the workers, peasants and soldiers, giving 
them complete freedom to go among the masses and to create a 
genuinely revolutionary literature and art. Therefore, here among 
us the problem is nearing solution. But nearing solution is not the 
same as a complete and thorough solution. We must study Marxism 
and study society, as we have been saying, precisely in order to 
achieve a complete and thorough solution. By Marxism we mean 
living Marxism which plays an effective role in the life and struggle 
of the masses, not Marxism in words. With Marxism in words transformed 
into Marxism in real life, there will be no more sectarianism. 
Not only will the problem of sectarianism be solved, but many other 
problems as well.

80 MAO TSE-TUNG 
II 
Having settled the problem of whom to serve, we come to the 
next problem, how to serve. To put it in the words of some of our 
comrades: should we devote ourselves to raising standards, or should 
we devote ourselves to popularization? 
In the past, some comrades, to a certain or even a serious extent, 
belittled and neglected popularization and laid undue stress on raising 
standards. Stress should be laid on raising standards, but to do so 
one-sidedly and exclusively, to do so excessively, is a mistake. The 
lack of a clear solution to the problem of ³for whom?², which I 
referred to earlier, also manifests itself in this connection. As these 
comrades are not clear on the problem of ³for whom?², they have 
no correct criteria for the ³raising of standards² and the ³popularization² 
they speak of, and are naturally still less able to find the 
correct relationship between the two. Since our literature and art 
are basically for the workers, peasants and soldiers, ³popularization² 
means to popularize among the workers, peasants and soldiers, and 
³raising standards² means to advance from their present level. What 
should we popularize among them? Popularize what is needed and 
can be readily accepted by the feudal landlord class? Popularize what 
is needed and can be readily accepted by the bourgeoisie? Popularize 
what is needed and can be readily accepted by the petty-bourgeois 
intellectuals? No, none of these will do. We must popularize only 
what is needed and can be readily accepted by the workers, peasants 
and soldiers themselves. Consequently, prior to the task of educating 
the workers, peasants and soldiers, there is the task of learning from 
them. This is even more true of raising standards. There must be a 
basis from which to raise. Take a bucket of water, for instance; where 
is it to be raised from if not from the ground? From mid-air? From 
what basis, then, are literature and art to be raised? From the basis 
of the feudal classes? From the basis of the bourgeoisie? From the 
basis of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals? No, not from any of these; 
only from the basis of the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. 
Nor does this mean raising the workers, peasants and soldiers to the 
³heights² of the feudal classes, the bourgeoisie or the petty-bourgeois 
intellectuals; it means raising the level of literature and art in the 
direction in which the workers, peasants and soldiers are themselves 
advancing, in the direction in which the proletariat is advancing. 
Here again the task of learning from the workers, peasants and

81 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
soldiers comes in. Only by starting from the workers, peasants and 
soldiers can we have a correct understanding of popularization and 
of the raising of standards and find the proper relationship between 
the two. 
In the last analysis, what is the source of all literature and art? 
Works of literature and art, as ideological forms, are products of the 
reflection in the human brain of the life of a given society. Revolutionary 
literature and art are the products of the reflection of the 
life of the people in the brains of revolutionary writers and artists. 
The life of the people is always a mine of the raw materials for 
literature and art, materials in their natural form, materials that are 
crude, but most vital, rich and fundamental; they make all literature 
and art seem pallid by comparison; they provide literature and art 
with an inexhaustible source, their only source. They are the only 
source, for there can be no other. Some may ask, is there not another 
source in books, in the literature and art of ancient times and of 
foreign countries? In fact, the literary and artistic works of the past 
are not a source but a stream; they were created by our predecessors 
and the foreigners out of the literary and artistic raw materials they 
found in the life of the people of their time and place. We must take 
over all the fine things in our literary and artistic heritage, critically 
assimilate whatever is beneficial, and use them as examples when 
we create works out of the literary and artistic raw materials in the 
life of the people of our own time and place. It makes a difference 
whether or not we have such examples, the difference between 
crudeness and refinement, between roughness and polish, between a 
low and a high level, and between slower and faster work. Therefore, 
we must on no account reject the legacies of the ancients and 
the foreigners or refuse to learn from them, even though they are 
the works of the feudal or bourgeois classes. But taking over legacies 
and using them as examples must never replace our own creative 
work; nothing can do that. Uncritical transplantation or copying 
from the ancients and the foreigners is the most sterile and harmful 
dogmatism in literature and art. China¹s revolutionary writers and 
artists, writers and artists of promise, must go among the masses; 
they must for a long period of time unreservedly and whole-heartedly 
go among the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, go into the 
heat of the struggle, go to the only source, the broadest and richest 
source, in order to observe, experience, study and analyse all the 
different kinds of people, all the classes, all the masses, all the vivid

82 MAO TSE-TUNG 
patterns of life and struggle, all the raw materials of literature and 
art. Only then can they proceed to creative work. Otherwise, you 
will have nothing to work with and you will be nothing but a phoney 
writer or artist, the kind that Lu Hsun in his will so earnestly 
cautioned his son never to become.5 
Although man¹s social life is the only source of literature and 
art and is incomparably livelier and richer in content, the people are 
not satisfied with life alone and demand literature and art as well. 
Why? Because, while both are beautiful, life as reflected in works 
of literature and art can and ought to be on a higher plane, more 
intense, more concentrated, more typical, nearer the ideal, and therefore 
more universal than actual everyday life. Revolutionary literature 
and art should create a variety of characters out of real life and 
help the masses to propel history forward. For example, there is 
suffering from hunger, cold and oppression on the one hand, and exploitation 
and oppression of man by man on the other. These facts exist 
everywhere and people look upon them as commonplace. Writers and 
artists concentrate such everyday phenomena, typify the contradictions 
and struggles within them and produce works which awaken the masses, 
fire them with enthusiasm and impel them to unite and struggle to 
transform their environment. Without such literature and art, this task 
could not be fulfilled, or at least not so effectively and speedily. 
What is meant by popularizing and by raising standards in works 
of literature and art? What is the relationship between these two 
tasks? Popular works are simpler and plainer, and therefore more 
readily accepted by the broad masses of the people today. Works 
of a higher quality, being more polished, are more difficult to produce 
and in general do not circulate so easily and quickly among the 
masses at present. The problem facing the workers, peasants and 
soldiers is this: they are now engaged in a bitter and bloody struggle 
with the enemy but are illiterate and uneducated as a result of long 
years of rule by the feudal and bourgeois classes, and therefore they 
are eagerly demanding enlightenment, education and works of literature 
and art which meet their urgent needs and which are easy to 
absorb, in order to heighten their enthusiasm in struggle and confidence 
in victory, strengthen their unity and fight the enemy with 
one heart and one mind. For them the prime need is not ³more 
flowers on the brocade² but ³fuel in snowy weather². In present 
conditions, therefore, popularization is the more pressing task. It is 
wrong to belittle or neglect popularization.

83 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
Nevertheless, no hard and fast line can be drawn between 
popularization and the raising of standards. Not only is it possible 
to popularize some works of higher quality even now, but the cultural 
level of the broad masses is steadily rising. If popularization 
remains at the same level for ever, with the same stuff being supplied 
month after month and year after year, always the same ³Little 
Cowherd²6 and the same ³man, hand, mouth, knife, cow, goat²,7 
will not the educators and those being educated be six of one and 
half a dozen of the other? What would be the sense of such popularization? 
The people demand popularization and, following that, 
higher standards; they demand higher standards month by month 
and year by year. Here popularization means popularizing for the 
people and raising of standards means raising the level for the 
people. And such raising is not from mid-air, or behind closed doors, 
but is actually based on popularization. It is determined by and 
at the same time guides popularization. In China as a whole the 
development of the revolution and of revolutionary culture is uneven 
and their spread is gradual. While in one place there is popularization 
and then raising of standards on the basis of popularization, 
in other places popularization has not even begun. Hence good 
experience in popularization leading to higher standards in onelocality 
can be applied in other localities and serve to guide popularization 
and the raising of standards there, saving many twists 
and turns along the road. Internationally, the good experience of 
foreign countries, and especially Soviet experience, can also serve 
to guide us. With us, therefore, the raising of standards is based 
on popularization, while popularization is guided by the raising of 
standards. Precisely for this reason, so far from being an obstacle to 
the raising of standards, the work of popularization we are speaking 
of supplies the basis for the work of raising standards which we are 
now doing on a limited scale, and prepares the necessary conditions 
for us to raise standards in the future on a much broader scale. 
Besides such raising of standards as meets the needs of the 
masses directly, there is the kind which meets their needs indirectly, 
that is, the kind which is needed by the cadres. The cadres are the 
advanced elements of the masses and generally have received more 
education; literature and art of a higher level are entirely necessary 
for them. To ignore this would be a mistake. Whatever is done for 
the cadres is also entirely for the masses, because it is only through 
the cadres that we can educate and guide the masses. If we go against

84 MAO TSE-TUNG 
this aim, if what we give the cadres cannot help them educate and 
guide the masses, our work of raising standards will be like shooting 
at random and will depart from the fundamental principle of serving 
the masses of the people. 
To sum up: through the creative labour of revolutionary writers 
and artists, the raw materials found in the life of the people are 
shaped into the ideological form of literature and art serving the 
masses of the people. Included here are the more advanced literature 
and art as developed on the basis of elementary literature and art 
and as required by those sections of the masses whose level has been 
raised, or, more immediately, by the cadres among the masses. Also 
included here are elementary literature and art which, conversely, 
are guided by more advanced literature and art and are needed 
primarily by the overwhelming majority of the masses at present. 
Whether more advanced or elementary, all our literature and art 
are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, 
peasants and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants 
and soldiers and are for their use. 
Now that we have settled the problem of the relationship between 
the raising of standards and popularization, that of the relationship 
between the specialists and the popularizers can also be settled. Our 
specialists are not only for the cadres, but also, and indeed chiefly, 
for the masses. Our specialists in literature should pay attention 
to the wall newspapers of the masses and to the reportage written 
in the army and the villages. Our specialists in drama should pay 
attention to the small troupes in the army and the villages. Our 
specialists in music should pay attention to the songs of the masses. 
Our specialists in the fine arts should pay attention to the fine arts 
of the masses. All these comrades should make close contact with 
comrades engaged in the work of popularizing literature and art 
among the masses. On the one hand, they should help and guide the 
popularizers, and on the other, they should learn from these comrades 
and, through them, draw nourishment from the masses to replenish 
and enrich themselves so that their specialities do not become ³ivory 
towers², detached from the masses and from reality and devoid of 
content or life. We should esteem the specialists, for they are very 
valuable to our cause. But we should tell them that no revolutionary 
writer or artist can do any meaningful work unless he is closely linked 
with the masses, gives expression to their thoughts and feelings and 
serves them as a loyal spokesman. Only by speaking for the masses

85 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
can he educate them and only by being their pupil can he be their 
teacher. If he regards himself as their master, as an aristocrat who 
lords it over the ³lower orders², then, no matter how talented he 
may be, he will not be needed by the masses and his work will have 
no future. 
Is this attitude of ours utilitarian? Materialists do not oppose 
utilitarianism in general but the utilitarianism of the feudal, bourgeois 
and petty-bourgeois classes; they oppose those hypocrites who attack 
utilitarianism in words but in deeds embrace the most selfish and 
short-sighted utilitarianism. There is no ³ism² in the world that transcends 
utilitarian considerations; in class society there can be only the 
utilitarianism of this or that class. We are proletarian revolutionary 
utilitarians and take as our point of departure the unity of the present 
and future interests of the broadest masses, who constitute over 90 
per cent of the population; hence we are revolutionary utilitarians 
aiming for the broadest and the most long-range objectives, not narrow 
utilitarians concerned only with the partial and the immediate. If, 
for instance, you reproach the masses for their utilitarianism and yet 
for your own utility, or that of a narrow clique, force on the market 
and propagandize among the masses a work which pleases only the 
few but is useless or even harmful to the majority, then you are not 
only insulting the masses but also revealing your own lack of selfknowledge. 
A thing is good only when it brings real benefit to the 
masses of the people. Your work may be as good as ³The Spring 
Snow², but if for the time being it caters only to the few and the 
masses are still singing the ³Song of the Rustic poor²,8 you will get 
nowhere by simply scolding them instead of trying to raise their level. 
The question now is to bring about a unity between ³The Spring 
Snow² and the ³Song of the Rustic Poor², between higher standards 
and popularization. Without such a unity, the highest art of any 
expert cannot help being utilitarian in the narrowest sense; you may 
call this art ³pure and lofty² but that is merely your own name for it 
which the masses will not endorse. 
Once we have solved the problems of fundamental policy, of 
serving the workers, peasants and soldiers and of how to serve them, 
such other problems as whether to write about the bright or the dark 
side of life and the problem of unity will also be solved. If everyone 
agrees on the fundamental policy, it should be adhered to by all our 
workers, all our schools, publications and organizations in the field 
of literature and art and in all our literary and artistic activities. It

86 MAO TSE-TUNG 
is wrong to depart from this policy and anything at variance with it 
must be duly corrected. 
III 
Since our literature and art are for the masses of the people, 
we can proceed to discuss a problem of inner-Party relations, i.e., 
the relation between the Party¹s work in literature and art and the 
Party¹s work as a whole, and in addition a problem of the Party¹s 
external relations, i.e., the relation between the Party¹s work in 
literature and art and the work of non-Party people in this field, 
a problem of the united front in literary and art circles. 
Let us consider the first problem. In the world today all culture, 
all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to 
definite political lines. There is in fact no such thing as art for art¹s 
sake, art that stands above classes or art that is detached from or 
independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the 
whole proletarian revolutionary cause; they are, as Lenin said, cogs 
and wheels9 in the whole revolutionary machine. Therefore, Party 
work in literature and art occupies a definite and assigned position 
in Party revolutionary work as a whole and is subordinated to the 
revolutionary tasks set by the Party in a given revolutionary period. 
Opposition to this arrangement is certain to lead to dualism or 
pluralism, and in essence amounts to ³politics  Marxist, art  
bourgeois², as with Trotsky. We do not favour overstressing the 
importance of literature and art, but neither do we favour underestimating 
their importance. Literature and art are subordinate to 
politics, but in their turn exert a great influence on politics. Revolutionary 
literature and art are part of the whole revolutionary cause, 
they are cogs and wheels in it, and though in comparison with certain 
other and more important parts they may be less significant and less 
urgent and may occupy a secondary position, nevertheless, they are 
indispensable cogs and wheels in the whole machine, an indispensable 
part of the entire revolutionary cause. If we had no literature and 
art even in the broadest and most ordinary sense, we could not carry 
on the revolutionary movement and win victory. Failure to recognize 
this is wrong. Furthermore, when we say that literature and art are 
subordinate to politics, we mean class politics, the politics of the 
masses, not the politics of a few so-called statesmen. Politics, whether 
revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, is the struggle of class against

87 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
class, not the activity of a few individuals. The revolutionary struggle 
on the ideological and artistic fronts must be subordinate to the 
political struggle because only through politics can the needs of the 
class and the masses find expression in concentrated form. Revolutionary 
statesmen, the political specialists who know the science or 
art of revolutionary politics, are simply the leaders of millions upon 
millions of statesmen  the masses. Their task is to collect the opinions 
of these mass statesmen, sift and refine them, and return them to 
the masses, who then take them and put them into practice. They are 
therefore not the kind of aristocratic ³statesmen² who work behind 
closed doors and fancy they have a monopoly of wisdom. Herein lies 
the difference in principle between proletarian statesmen and decadent 
bourgeois statesmen. This is precisely why there can be complete 
unity between the political character of our literary and artistic works 
and their truthfulness. It would be wrong to fail to realize this and 
to debase the politics and the statesmen of the proletariat. 
Let us consider next the question of the united front in the world 
of literature and art. Since literature and art are subordinate to 
politics and since the fundamental problem in China¹s politics today 
is resistance to Japan, our Party writers and artists must in the first 
place unite on this issue of resistance to Japan with all non-Party 
writers and artists (ranging from Party sympathizers and pettybourgeois 
writers and artists to all those writers and artists of the 
bourgeois and landlord classes who are in favour of resistance to 
Japan). Secondly, we should unite with them on the issue of democracy. 
On this issue there is a section of anti-Japanese writers and 
artists who do not agree with us, so the range of unity will unavoidably 
be somewhat more limited. Thirdly, we should unite with them 
on issues peculiar to the literary and artistic world, questions of 
method and style in literature and art; here again, as we are for 
socialist realism and some people do not agree, the range of unity 
will be narrower still. While on one issue there is unity, on another 
there is struggle, there is criticism. The issues are at once separate 
and interrelated, so that even on the very ones which give rise to 
unity, such as resistance to Japan, there are at the same time struggle 
and criticism. In a united front, ³all unity and no struggle² and ³all 
struggle and no unity² are both wrong policies  as with the Right 
capitulationism and tailism, or the ³Left² exclusivism and sectarianism, 
practised by some comrades in the past. This is as true in 
literature and art as in politics.

88 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The petty-bourgeois writers and artists constitute an important 
force among the forces of the united front in literary and art circles 
in China. There are many shortcomings in both their thinking and 
their works, but, comparatively speaking, they are inclined towards 
the revolution and are close to the working people. Therefore, it 
is an especially important task to help them overcome their shortcomings 
and to win them over to the front which serves the working 
people. 
IV 
Literary and art criticism is one of the principal methods of 
struggle in the world of literature and art. It should be developed 
and, as comrades have rightly pointed out, our past work in this 
respect has been quite inadequate. Literary and art criticism is a 
complex question which requires a great deal of special study. Here 
I shall concentrate only on the basic problem of criteria in criticism. 
I shall also comment briefly on a few specific problems raised by 
some comrades and on certain incorrect views. 
In literary and art criticism there are two criteria, the political 
and the artistic. According to the political criterion, everything is 
good that is helpful to unity and resistance to Japan, that encourages 
the masses to be of one heart and one mind, that opposes retrogression 
and promotes progress; on the other hand, everything is bad that is 
detrimental to unity and resistance to Japan, foments dissension and 
discord among the masses and opposes progress and drags people 
back. How can we tell the good from the bad  by the motive (the 
subjective intention) or by the effect (social practice)? Idealists stress 
motive and ignore effect, while mechanical materialists stress effect 
and ignore motive. In contradistinction to both, we dialectical materialists 
insist on the unity of motive and effect. The motive of 
serving the masses is inseparably linked with the effect of winning 
their approval; the two must be united. The motive of serving the 
individual or a small clique is not good, nor is it good to have the 
motive of serving the masses without the effect of winning their 
approval and benefiting them. In examining the subjective intention 
of a writer or artist, that is, whether his motive is correct and good, 
we do not judge by his declarations but by the effect of his actions 
(mainly his works) on the masses in society. The criterion for judging 
subjective intention or motive is social practice and its effect. We

89 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
want no sectarianism in our literary and art criticism and, subject to 
the general principle of unity for resistance to Japan, we should 
tolerate literary and art works with a variety of political attitudes. 
But at the same time, in our criticism we must adhere firmly to 
principle and severely criticize and repudiate all works of literature 
and art expressing views in opposition to the nation, to science, to the 
masses and to the Communist Party, because these so-called works 
of literature and art proceed from the motive and produce the effect 
of undermining unity for resistance to Japan. According to the artistic 
criterion, all works of a higher artistic quality are good or comparatively 
good, while those of a lower artistic quality are bad or 
comparatively bad. Here, too, of course, social effect must be taken 
into account. There is hardly a writer or artist who does not consider 
his own work beautiful, and our criticism ought to permit the free 
competition of all varieties of works of art; but it is also entirely 
necessary to subject these works to correct criticism according to the 
criteria of the science of aesthetics, so that art of a lower level can 
be gradually raised to a higher and art which does not meet the 
demands of the struggle of the broad masses can be transformed into 
art that does. 
There is the political criterion and there is the artistic criterion; 
what is the relationship between the two? Politics cannot be equated 
with art, nor can a general world outlook be equated with a method 
of artistic creation and criticism. We deny not only that there is an 
abstract and absolutely unchangeable political criterion, but also that 
there is an abstract and absolutely unchangeable artistic criterion; 
each class in every class society has its own political and artistic 
criteria. But all classes in all class societies invariably put the political 
criterion first and the artistic criterion second. The bourgeoisie always 
shuts out proletarian literature and art, however great their artistic 
merit. The proletariat must similarly distinguish among the literary 
and art works of past ages and determine its attitude towards them 
only after examining their attitude to the people and whether or not 
they had any progressive significance historically. Some works which 
politically are downright reactionary may have a certain artistic 
quality. The more reactionary their content and the higher their 
artistic quality, the more poisonous they are to the people, and the 
more necessary it is to reject them. A common characteristic of the 
literature and art of all exploiting classes in their period of decline is 
the contradiction between their reactionary political content and their

90 MAO TSE-TUNG 
artistic form. What we demand is the unity of politics and art, the 
unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content 
and the highest possible perfection of artistic form. Works of art 
which lack artistic quality have no force, however progressive they 
are politically. Therefore, we oppose both the tendency to produce 
works of art with a wrong political viewpoint and the tendency 
towards the ³poster and slogan style² which is correct in political 
viewpoint but lacking in artistic power. On questions of literature and 
art we must carry on a struggle on two fronts. 
Both these tendencies can be found in the thinking of many comrades. 
A good number of comrades tend to neglect artistic technique; 
it is therefore necessary to give attention to the raising of artistic 
standards. But as I see it, the political side is more of a problem at 
present. Some comrades lack elementary political knowledge and 
consequently have all sorts of muddled ideas. Let me cite a few 
examples from Yenan. 
³The theory of human nature.² Is there such a thing as human 
nature? Of course there is. But there is only human nature in the 
concrete, no human nature in the abstract. In class society there is 
only human nature of a class character; there is no human nature 
above classes. We uphold the human nature of the proletariat and 
of the masses of the people, while the landlord and bourgeois classes 
uphold the human nature of their own classes, only they do not say 
so but make it out to be the only human nature in existence. The 
human nature boosted by certain petty-bourgeois intellectuals is also 
divorced from or opposed to the masses; what they call human nature 
is in essence nothing but bourgeois individualism, and so, in their 
eyes, proletarian human nature is contrary to human nature. ³The 
theory of human nature² which some people in Yenan advocate as 
the basis of their so-called theory of literature and art puts the matter 
in just this way and is wholly wrong. 
³The fundamental point of departure for literature and art is 
love, love of humanity.² Now love may serve as a point of departure, 
but there is a more basic one. Love as an idea is a product of objective 
practice. Fundamentally, we do not start from ideas but from objective 
practice. Our writers and artists who come from the ranks of 
the intellectuals love the proletariat because society has made them 
feel that they and the proletariat share a common fate. We hate 
Japanese imperialism because Japanese imperialism oppresses us. 
There is absolutely no such thing in the world as love or hatred with

91 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
out reason or cause. As for the so-called love of humanity, there 
has been no such all-inclusive love since humanity was divided into 
classes. All the ruling classes of the past were fond of advocating it, 
and so were many so-called sages and wise men, but nobody has ever 
really practised it, because it is impossible in class society. There will 
be genuine love of humanity  after classes are eliminated all over 
the world. Classes have split society into many antagonistic groupings; 
there will be love of all humanity when classes are eliminated, 
but not now. We cannot love enemies, we cannot love social evils, 
our aim is to destroy them. This is common sense; can it be that some 
of our writers and artists still do not understand this? 
³Literary and artistic works have always laid equal stress on the 
bright and the dark, half and half.² This statement contains many 
muddled ideas. It is not true that literature and art have always done 
this. Many petty-bourgeois writers have never discovered the bright 
side. Their works only expose the dark and are known as the ³literature 
of exposure². Some of their works simply specialize in preaching 
pessimism and world-weariness. On the other hand, Soviet literature 
in the period of socialist construction portrays mainly the bright. It, 
too, describes shortcomings in work and portrays negative characters, 
but this only serves as a contrast to bring out the brightness of the 
whole picture and is not on a so-called half-and-half basis. The writers 
and artists of the bourgeoisie in its period of reaction depict the 
revolutionary masses as mobs and themselves as saints, thus reversing 
the bright and the dark. Only truly revolutionary writers and artists 
can correctly solve the problem of whether to extol or to expose. All 
the dark forces harming the masses of the people must be exposed 
and all the revolutionary struggles of the masses of the people must 
be extolled; this is the fundamental task of revolutionary writers 
and artists. 
³The task of literature and art has always been to expose.² This 
assertion, like the previous one, arises from ignorance of the science 
of history. Literature and art, as we have shown, have never been 
devoted solely to exposure. For revolutionary writers and artists the 
targets for exposure can never be the masses, but only the aggressors, 
exploiters and oppressors and the evil influence the have on the 
people. The masses too have shortcomings, which should be overcome 
by criticism and self-criticism within the people¹s own ranks, 
and such criticism and self-criticism is also one of the most important 
tasks of literature and art. But this should not be regarded as any

92 MAO TSE-TUNG 
sort of ³exposure of the people². As for the people, the question is 
basically one of education and of raising their level. Only counterrevolutionary 
writers and artists describe the people as ³born fools² 
and the revolutionary masses as ³tyrannical mobs². 
³This is still the period of the satirical essay, and Lu Hsun¹s style 
of writing is still needed.² Living under the rule of the dark forces 
and deprived of freedom of speech, Lu Hsun used burning satire and 
freezing irony, cast in the form of essays, to do battle; and he was 
entirely right. We, too, must hold up to sharp ridicule the fascists, 
the Chinese reactionaries and everything that harms the people; but 
in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the anti-Japanese 
base areas behind the enemy lines, where democracy and freedom 
are granted in full to the revolutionary writers and artists and withheld 
only from the counter-revolutionaries, the style of the essay should 
not simply be like Lu Hsun¹s. Here we can shout at the top of our 
voices and have no need for veiled and roundabout expressions, which 
are hard for the people to understand. When dealing with the people 
and not with their enemies, Lu Hsun never ridiculed or attacked the 
revolutionary people and the revolutionary Party in his ³satirical essay 
period², and these essays were entirely different in manner from 
those directed against the enemy. To criticize the people¹s shortcomings 
is necessary, as we have already said, but in doing so we 
must truly take the stand of the people and speak out of whole-hearted 
eagerness to protect and educate them. To treat comrades like enemies 
is to go over to the stand of the enemy. Are we then to abolish satire? 
No. Satire is always necessary. But there are several kinds of satire, 
each with a different attitude, satire to deal with our enemies, satire 
to deal with our allies and satire to deal with our own ranks. We are 
not opposed to satire in general; what we must abolish is the abuse 
of satire. 
³I am not given to praise and eulogy. The works of people who 
eulogize what is bright are not necessarily great and the works of 
those who depict the dark are not necessarily paltry.² If you are a 
bourgeois writer or artist, you will eulogize not the proletariat but 
the bourgeoisie, and if you are a proletarian writer or artist, you will 
eulogize not the bourgeoisie but the proletariat and working people: 
it must be one or the other. The works of the eulogists of the bourgeoisie 
are not necessarily great, nor are the works of those who show 
that the bourgeoisie is dark necessarily paltry; the works of the 
eulogists of the proletariat are not necessarily not great, but the works

93 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
of those who depict the so-called ³darkness² of the proletariat are 
bound to be paltry  are these not facts of history as regards literature 
and art? Why should we not eulogize the people, the creators 
of the history of mankind? Why should we not eulogize the proletariat, 
the Communist Party, New Democracy and socialism? There is a 
type of person who has no enthusiasm for the people¹s cause and looks 
coldly from the side-lines at the struggles and victories of the proletariat 
and its vanguard; what he is interested in, and will never 
weary of eulogizing, is himself, plus perhaps a few figures in his small 
coterie. Of course, such petty-bourgeois individualists are unwilling 
to eulogize the deeds and virtues of the revolutionary people or 
heighten their courage in struggle and their confidence in victory. 
Persons of this type are merely termites in the revolutionary ranks; 
of course, the revolutionary people have no need for these ³singers². 
³It is not a question of stand; my class stand is correct, my intentions 
are good and I understand all right, but I am not good at 
expressing myself and so the effect turns out bad.² I have already 
spoken about the dialectical materialist view of motive and effect. 
Now I want to ask, is not the question of effect one of stand? A person 
who acts solely by motive and does not inquire what effect his action 
will have is like a doctor who merely writes prescriptions but does 
not care how many patients die of them. Or take a political party 
which merely makes declarations but does not care whether they are 
carried out. It may well be asked, is this a correct stand? And is the 
intention here good? Of course, mistakes may occur even though the 
effect has been taken into account beforehand, but is the intention 
good when one continues in the same old rut after facts have proved 
that the effect is bad? In judging a party or a doctor, we must look 
at practice, at the effect. The same applies in judging a writer. A 
person with truly good intentions must take the effect into account, 
sum up experience and study the methods or, in creative work, study 
the technique of expression. A person with truly good intentions must 
criticize the shortcomings and mistakes in his own work with the 
utmost candour and resolve to correct them. This is precisely why 
Communists employ the method of self-criticism. This alone is the 
correct stand. Only in this process of serious and responsible practice 
is it possible gradually to understand what the correct stand is and 
gradually obtain a good grasp of it. If one does not move in this 
direction in practice, if there is simply the complacent assertion that 
one ³understands all right², then in fact one has not understood at all.

94 MAO TSE-TUNG 
³To call on us to study Marxism is to repeat the mistake of the 
dialectical materialist creative method, which will harm the creative 
mood.² To study Marxism means to apply the dialectical materialist 
and historical materialist viewpoint in our observation of the world, 
of society and of literature and art; it does not mean writing philosophical 
lectures into our works of literature and art. Marxism 
embraces but cannot replace realism in literary and artistic creation, 
just as it embraces but cannot replace the atomic and electronic 
theories in physics. Empty, dry dogmatic formulas do indeed destroy 
the creative mood; not only that, they first destroy Marxism. Dogmatic 
³Marxism² is not Marxism, it is anti-Marxism. Then does not Marxism 
destroy the creative mood? Yes, it does. It definitely destroys creative 
moods that are feudal, bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, liberalistic, individualist, 
nihilist, art-for-art¹s sake, aristocratic, decadent or pessimistic, 
and every other creative mood that is alien to the masses of the people 
and to the proletariat. So far as proletarian writers and artists are 
concerned, should not these kinds of creative moods be destroyed? 
I think they should; they should be utterly destroyed. And while they 
are being destroyed, something new can be constructed. 
V 
The problems discussed here exist in our literary and art circles in 
Yenan. What does that show? It shows that wrong styles of work 
still exist to a serious extent in our literary and art circles and that 
there are still many defects among our comrades, such as idealism, 
dogmatism, empty illusions, empty talk, contempt for practice and 
aloofness from the masses, all of which call for an effective and 
serious campaign of rectification. 
We have many comrades who are still not very clear on the 
difference between the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie. There 
are many Party members who have joined the Communist Party 
organizationally but have not yet joined the Party wholly or at all 
ideologically. Those who have not joined the Party ideologically still 
carry a great deal of the muck of the exploiting classes in their heads, 
and have no idea at all of what proletarian ideology, or communism, 
or the Party is. ³Proletarian ideology?² they think. ³The same old 
stuff!² Little do they know that it is no easy matter to acquire this 
stuff. Some will never have the slightest Communist flavour about 
them as long as they live and can only end up by leaving the Party.

95 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
Therefore, though the majority in our Party and in our ranks are 
clean and honest, we must in all seriousness put things in order both 
ideologically and organizationally if we are to develop the revolutionary 
movement more effectively and bring it to speedier success. 
To put things in order organizationally requires our first doing so 
ideologically, our launching a struggle of proletarian ideology against 
non-proletarian ideology. An ideological struggle is already under 
way in literary and art circles in Yenan, and it is most necessary. 
Intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin always stubbornly try in all 
sorts of ways, including literary and artistic ways, to project themselves 
and spread their views, and they want the Party and the 
world to be remoulded in their own image. In the circumstances it is 
our duty to jolt these ³comrades² and tell them sharply, ³That won¹t 
work! The proletariat cannot accommodate itself to you; to yield to 
you would actually be to yield to the big landlord class and the big 
bourgeoisie and to run the risk of undermining our Party and our 
country.² Whom then must we yield to? We can mould the Party 
and the world only in the image of the proletarian vanguard. We 
hope our comrades in literary and art circles will realize the seriousness 
of this great debate and join actively in this struggle, so that 
every comrade may become sound and our entire ranks may become 
truly united and consolidated ideologically and organizationally. 
Because of confusion in their thinking, many of our comrades 
are not quite able to draw a real distinction between our revolutionary 
base areas and the Kuomintang areas and they make many mistakes 
as a consequence. A good number of comrades have come here from 
the garrets of Shanghai, and in coming from those garrets to the 
revolutionary base areas, they have passed not only from one kind 
of place to another but from one historical epoch to another. One 
society is semi-feudal, semi-colonial, under the rule of the big landlords 
and big bourgeoisie, the other is a revolutionary new-democratic 
society under the leadership of the proletariat. To come to the 
revolutionary bases means to enter an epoch unprecedented in the 
thousands of years of Chinese history, an epoch in which the masses 
of the people wield state power. Here the people around us and the 
audience for our propaganda are totally different. The past epoch 
is gone, never to return. Therefore, we must integrate ourselves 
with the new masses without any hesitation. If, living among the 
new masses, some comrades, as I said before, are still ³lacking in 
knowledge and understanding² and remain ³heroes with no place

96 MAO TSE-TUNG 
to display their prowess², then difficulties will arise for them, and 
not only when they go out to the villages; right here in Yenan difficulties 
will arise for them. Some comrades may think, ³Well, I had 
better continue writing for the readers in the Great Rear Area;10 it is 
a job I know well and has national significance¹.² This idea is entirely 
wrong. The Great Rear Area is also changing. Readers there expect 
authors in the revolutionary base areas to tell about the new people 
and the new world and not to bore them with the same old tales. 
Therefore, the more a work is written for the masses in the revolutionary 
base areas, the more national significance will it have. 
Fadeyev in The Debacle11 only told the story of a small guerrilla 
unit and had no intention of pandering to the palate of readers in the 
old world; yet the book has exerted world-wide influence. At any 
rate in China its influence is very great, as you know. China is moving 
forward, not back, and it is the revolutionary base areas, not any 
of the backward, retrogressive areas, that are leading China forward. 
This is a fundamental issue that, above all, comrades must come to 
understand in the rectification movement. 
Since integration into the new epoch of the masses is essential, 
it is necessary thoroughly to solve the problem of the relationship 
between the individual and the masses. This couplet from a poem 
by Lu Hsun should be our motto: 
Fierce-browed, I coolly defy a thousand pointing fingers, 
Head-bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children.12 
The ³thousand pointing fingers² are our enemies, and we will never 
yield to them, no matter how ferocious. The ³children² here symbolize 
the proletariat and the masses. All Communists, all revolutionaries, 
all revolutionary literary and art workers should learn from the 
example of Lu Hsun and be ³oxen² for the proletariat and the masses, 
bending their backs to the task until their dying day. Intellectuals 
who want to integrate themselves with the masses, who want to 
serve the masses, must go through a process in which they and the 
masses come to know each other well. This process may, and certainly 
will, involve much pain and friction, but if you have the determination, 
you will be able to fulfil these requirements. 
Today I have discussed only some of the problems of fundamental 
orientation for our literature and art movement; many specific problems 
remain which will require further study. I am confident that 
comrades here are determined to move in the direction indicated.

97 YENAN FORUM ON LITERATURE AND ART 
I believe that in the course of the rectification movement and in the 
long period of study and work to come, you will surely be able to 
bring about a transformation in yourselves and in your works, to 
create many fine works which will be warmly welcomed by the 
masses of the people, and to advance the literature and art movement 
in the revolutionary base areas and throughout China to a glorious 
new stage.

described the characteristics of proletarian literature as follows: 
It will be a free literature, because the idea of socialism and sympathy with 
the working people, and not greed or careerism, will bring ever new forces to 
its ranks. It will be a free literature, because it will serve, not some satiated 
heroine, not the bored ³upper ten thousand² suffering from fatty degeneration, 
but the millions and tens of millions of working people  the flower of the 
country, its strength and its future. It will be a free literature, enriching the 
last word in the revolutionary thought of mankind with the experience and 
living work of the socialist proletariat, bringing about permanent interaction 
between the experience of the past (scientific socialism, the completion of the 
development of socialism from its primitive, utopian forms) and the experience 
of the present (the present struggle of the worker comrades). (Collected Works,

A MOST IMPORTANT POLICY 
September 7, 1942 
Ever since the Central Committee of the Party put forward the 
policy of ³better troops and simpler administration²,1 the Party organizations 
in many anti-Japanese base areas have been applying it, 
or making plans to apply it, in accordance with the directives of 
the Central Committee. The leading comrades of the Shansi-Hopei- 
Shantung-Honan border area have really taken this work in hand, 
setting an example of ³better troops and simpler administration². 
In some base areas, however, the comrades have not tried to do 
so very seriously because of their incomplete comprehension of this 
policy. They still fail to understand how it is related to the current 
situation and to other Party policies, or fail to regard it as most important. 
This matter has been discussed several times before in the 
Liberation Daily and we now wish to explain it further. 
All the Party¹s policies aim at the defeat of the Japanese invaders. 
From the fifth year onward, the War of Resistance has in fact entered 
the final stage of the struggle for victory. In this stage the situation 
is different from that in the first and second years of the war, and 
also from that in the third and fourth. A feature of the fifth and sixth 
years of the war is that while victory is drawing near, there are very 
great difficulties ahead; in other words, we are in the ³darkness 
before the dawn². This situation prevails at the present stage in 
all the anti-fascist countries, and in the whole of China as well; it is 
not confined to the base areas of the Eighth Route Army and the 
New Fourth Army, although it is particularly acute here. We are 
striving to defeat the Japanese invaders in two years. They will be 
years of extreme difficulty, differing greatly from the first and second 
two years of the war. This particular point must be anticipated by

Yenan. 
99

100 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the leading personnel in the revolutionary party and revolutionary 
army. Should they fail to do so, they will simply drift with events 
and, no matter how hard they try, they will not be able to attain 
victory and may even jeopardize the cause of the revolution. Although 
the situation in the anti-Japanese base areas in the enemy rear is 
already several times as difficult as before, the difficulty is not yet 
extreme. If we do not have a correct policy now, then extreme 
difficulty will overtake us. People in general are liable to judge by 
past and present conditions and to be misled into thinking that the 
future will be much the same. They are unable to anticipate that 
the ship may encounter submerged rocks or to steer clear of these 
rocks with cool heads. What are the submerged rocks in the path 
of the ship of the War of Resistance? They are the extremely grave 
material difficulties of the final stage of the war. The Central Committee 
of the Party has pointed them out and called on us to be on 
the alert and steer clear of them. Many of our comrades already 
understand the point but some do not, and that is the first obstacle 
we must overcome. There is the need for unity in the War of Resistance, 
and unity involves difficulties. These difficulties are political; they 
have occurred in the past and may occur again in the future. For 
five years, our Party has been overcoming them gradually and with 
the utmost effort; our slogan is to strengthen unity, and we must 
keep on doing so. But there are difficulties of another kind, the 
material ones. They will grow more and more acute. Today some 
comrades are still taking it easy and are not alive to the situation, 
and we must therefore alert them. All comrades in all the anti- 
Japanese base areas must recognize that from now on the material 
difficulties are bound to grow graver, that we must overcome them 
and that one important way of doing so is ³better troops and simpler 
administration². 
Why is the policy of better troops and simpler administration 
important for overcoming the material difficulties? It is clear that 
the present, and still more the future, war situation in the base areas 
will not permit us to cling to our past views. Our enormous war 
apparatus is suited to past conditions. It was then permissible and 
necessary. But things are different now, the base areas have shrunk 
and may continue to shrink for a period, and undoubtedly we cannot 
maintain the same enormous war apparatus as before. There is 
already a contradiction, which we must resolve, between our war 
apparatus and the war situation. The enemy¹s objective is to aggravate

101 A MOST IMPORTANT POLICY 
this contradiction, hence his policy of ³burn all, kill all, loot all². 
If we maintain our enormous apparatus, we shall fall right into his 
trap. If we reduce it and have better troops and simpler administration, 
our war apparatus, though reduced, will remain strong. By 
resolving the contradiction, which is that of ³a big fish in shallow 
water², and by adapting our war apparatus to the war situation, we 
shall prove even stronger, and so far from being defeated by the 
enemy we shall finally defeat him. That is why we say that the 
policy of ³better troops and simpler administration² put forward 
by the Central Committee of the Party is a most important policy. 
But men¹s minds are liable to be fettered by circumstance and 
habit from which even revolutionaries cannot always escape. We 
created this enormous apparatus ourselves, little thinking that one 
day we ourselves would have to reduce it; and now that the time 
has come to do so, we feel reluctant and find it very difficult. The 
enemy is bearing down upon us with his enormous war apparatus, 
and how dare we reduce ours? If we do, we shall feel that our forces 
are too few to cope with him. Such misgivings are precisely the result 
of being fettered by circumstance and habit. When the weather 
changes, it becomes necessary to change one¹s clothing. Each year 
as spring turns into summer, summer into autumn, autumn into 
winter and winter into spring we have to make this change. But owing 
to the force of habit people sometimes fail to make it at the proper 
turn and they fall ill. Present conditions in the base areas already 
require us to shed our winter garments and put on summer clothing 
so that we can move about nimbly to fight the enemy, but we are 
still heavily padded and weighed down, and quite unfit for combat. 
As for the question of how to deal with the enemy¹s enormous 
apparatus, we can learn from the example of how the Monkey King 
dealt with Princess Iron Fan. The Princess was a formidable demon, 
but by changing himself into a tiny insect the Monkey King made 
his way into her stomach and overpowered her.2 Liu Tsung-yuan¹s 
description of ³The Donkey in Kweichow²3 also contains a valuable 
lesson. A huge donkey was brought to Kweichow and the sight of 
him rather frightened a small tiger. But in the end this huge donkey 
was devoured by the small tiger. Our Eighth Route and New Fourth 
Armies are the Monkey King or the small tiger, and they are fully 
capable of dealing with the Japanese demon or donkey. Now it is 
imperative for us to do a little changing and make ourselves smaller 
but sturdier, and then we shall be invincible.

and is no longer confined to military matters. It suggests readjustment in organizations 
and their staff membership, and simplification of the administration and the work

that all the donkey could do was to bray and kick, the tiger fell upon it and 
devoured it.

THE TURNING POINT IN WORLD WAR II 
October 12, 1942
The Battle of Stalingrad has been compared by the British and 
American press to the Battle of Verdun, and the ³Red Verdun² 
is now famous all over the world. This comparison is not altogether 
appropriate. The Battle of Stalingrad is different in nature from the 
Battle of Verdun in World War I. But they have this in common  
now, as then, many people are misled by the German offensive into 
thinking that Germany can still win the war. In 1916 the German 
forces launched several attacks on the French fortress of Verdun, 
two years before World War I ended in the winter of 1918. The commander-
in-chief at Verdun was the German Crown Prince and the 
forces thrown into the battle were the cream of the German army. 
The battle was of decisive significance. After the ferocious German 
assaults failed, the entire German-Austrian-Turkish-Bulgarian bloc 
had no future, and from then on its difficulties mounted, it was 
deserted by its followers, it disintegrated, and finally collapsed. But 
at the time, the Anglo-American-French bloc did not grasp this situation, 
believing that the German army was still very powerful, and 
they were unaware of their own approaching victory. Historically, 
all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction invariably conduct 
a last desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces, and some 
revolutionaries are apt to be deluded for a time by this phenomenon 
of outward strength but inner weakness, failing to grasp the essential 
fact that the enemy is nearing extinction while they themselves are 
approaching victory. The rise of the forces of fascism and the war 
of aggression they have been conducting for some years are precisely 
the expression of such a last desperate struggle; and in this present 
war the attack on Stalingrad is the expression of the last desperate

103

104 MAO TSE-TUNG 
struggle of fascism itself. At this turning point in history, too, many 
people in the world anti-fascist front have been deluded by the ferocious 
appearance of fascism and have failed to discern its essence. 
For forty-eight days there raged an unprecedentedly bitter battle, 
unparalleled in the history of mankind  from August 23, when the 
entire German force crossed the bend of the River Don and began 
the all-out attack on Stalingrad, through September 15, when some 
German units broke into the industrial district in the northwestern 
section of the city, and right up to October 9, when the Soviet Information 
Bureau announced that the Red Army had breached the 
German line of encirclement in that district. Ultimately this battle 
was won by the Soviet forces. During those forty-eight days, the 
news of each setback or triumph from that city gripped the hearts 
of countless millions of people, now bringing them anxiety, now 
stirring them to elation. This battle is not only the turning point of 
the Soviet-German war, or even of the present anti-fascist world 
war, it is the turning point in the history of all mankind. Throughout 
these forty-eight days, the people of the world watched Stalingrad 
with even greater concern than they watched Moscow last October. 
Until his victory on the western front, Hitler seems to have been 
cautious. When he attacked Poland, when he attacked Norway, when 
he attacked Holland, Belgium, and France, and when he attacked 
the Balkans, he concentrated all his strength on one objective at a 
time, not daring to disperse his attention. After his victory on the 
western front, he became dizzy with success and attempted to defeat 
the Soviet Union in three months. He launched an offensive against 
this huge and powerful socialist country along the whole front 
stretching from Murmansk in the north to the Crimea in the south, 
and in so doing dispersed his forces. The failure of his Moscow 
campaign last October marked the end of the first stage of the 
Soviet-German war, and Hitler¹s first strategic plan failed. The Red 
Army halted the German offensive last year and launched a counteroffensive 
on all fronts in the winter, which constituted the second 
stage of the Soviet-German war, with Hitler turning to retreat and 
the defensive. In this period, after dismissing Brauchitsch, his commander-
in-chief, and taking over the command himself, he decided 
to abandon the plan for an all-out offensive, combed Europe for all 
available forces and prepared a final offensive which, though limited 
to the southern front, would, he imagined, strike at the vitals of the 
Soviet Union. Because it was in the nature of a final offensive on

105 THE TURNING POINT IN WORLD WAR II 
which the fate of fascism hung, Hitler concentrated the greatest 
possible forces and even moved in part of his aircraft and tanks from 
the North African battle front. With the German attack on Kerch 
and Sevastopol in May this year, the war entered its third stage. 
Massing an army of over 1,500,000, which was supported by the bulk 
of his air and tank forces, Hitler launched an offensive of unprecedented 
fury on Stalingrad and the Caucasus. He endeavoured to 
capture these two objectives at great speed for the twofold purpose 
of cutting the Volga and seizing Baku, intending subsequently to 
drive against Moscow to the north and break through to the Persian 
Gulf in the south; at the same time he directed the Japanese fascists 
to mass their troops in Manchuria in preparation for an attack on 
Siberia after the fall of Stalingrad. Hitler vainly hoped to weaken 
the Soviet Union to such an extent that he would be able to release 
the main forces of the German army from the Soviet theatre of war 
for dealing with an Anglo-American attack on the western front, and 
for seizing the resources of the Near East and effecting a junction 
with the Japanese; at the same time this would allow the main forces 
of the Japanese to be released from the north and, with their rear 
secure, to move west against China and south against Britain and 
the United States. That was how Hitler reckoned on winning victory 
for the fascist camp. But how did things turn out in this stage? Hitler 
came up against the Soviet tactics which sealed his fate. The Soviet 
Union adopted the policy of first luring the enemy in deep and then 
putting up a stubborn resistance. In five months of fighting the German 
army has failed either to penetrate to the Caucasian oil-fields or to 
seize Stalingrad, so that Hitler has been forced to halt his troops before 
high mountains and outside an impregnable city, unable to advance 
and unable to retreat, suffering immense losses and getting into an 
impasse. October is already here and winter is approaching; soon 
the third stage of the war will end and the fourth stage will begin. 
Not one of Hitler¹s strategic plans of attack against the Soviet Union 
has succeeded. In this period, bearing in mind his failure in the summer 
of last year when his forces were divided, Hitler concentrated 
his strength on the southern front. But as he still wanted to achieve 
the twofold purpose of cutting the Volga in the east and seizing 
the Caucasus in the south at a single stroke, he again divided his 
forces. He did not recognize that his strength did not match his 
ambitions, and he is now doomed  ³when the carrying pole is not 
secured at both ends, the loads slip off². As for the Soviet Union,

106 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the more she fights the stronger she grows. Stalin¹s brilliant strategic 
direction has completely gained the initiative and is everywhere 
drawing Hitler towards destruction. The fourth stage of the war, 
beginning this winter, will mark the approach of Hitler¹s doom. 
Comparing Hitler¹s position in the first and third stages of the 
war, we can see that he is on the threshold of final defeat. Both at 
Stalingrad and in the Caucasus the Red Army has now in fact stopped 
the German offensive; Hitler is now nearing exhaustion, having 
failed in his attacks on Stalingrad and the Caucasus. The forces 
which he managed to assemble throughout the winter, from last 
December to May of this year, have already been used up. In less 
than a month winter will set in on the Soviet-German front, and 
Hitler will have to turn hastily to the defensive. The whole belt west 
and south of the Don is his most vulnerable area, and the Red Army 
will go over to the counter-offensive there. This winter, goaded on 
by the fear of his impending doom, Hitler will once again reorganize 
his forces. To meet the dangers on both the eastern and western 
fronts, he may perhaps be able to scrape together the remnants of 
his forces, equip them and form them into a few new divisions and, 
in addition, he will turn for help to his three fascist partners, Italy, 
Rumania and Hungary, and extort some more cannon-fodder from 
them. However, he will have to face the enormous losses of a winter 
campaign in the east and be ready to deal with the second front in 
the west, while Italy, Rumania and Hungary, becoming pessimistic 
as they see that it is all up with Hitler, will increasingly fall away 
from him. In short, after October 9 there is only one road open to 
Hitler, the road to extinction. 
The Red Army¹s defence of Stalingrad in these forty-eight days 
has a certain similarity to the defence of Moscow last year. That 
is to say, Hitler¹s plan for this year has been foiled just as was his 
plan for last year. The difference, however, is that, although the 
Soviet people followed up their defence of Moscow with a winter 
counter-offensive, they had yet to face the summer offensive of the 
German army this year, partly because Germany and her European 
accomplices still had some fight left in them and partly because 
Britain and the United States delayed the opening of the second 
front. But now, following the battle for the defence of Stalingrad, 
the situation will be totally different from that of last year. On the 
one hand, the Soviet Union will launch a second winter counteroffensive 
on a vast scale, Britain and the United States will no longer

107 THE TURNING POINT IN WORLD WAR II 
be able to delay the opening of the second front (though the exact 
date cannot yet be foretold), and the people of Europe will be ready 
to rise up in response. On the other hand, Germany and her European 
accomplices no longer have the strength to mount large-scale offensives, 
and Hitler will have no alternative but to change his whole 
line of policy to the strategic defensive. Once Hitler is compelled 
to go over to the strategic defensive, the fate of fascism is as good 
as sealed. From its birth, a fascist state like Hitler¹s builds its political 
and military life on taking the offensive, and once its offensive stops 
its very life stops too. The Battle of Stalingrad will stop the offensive 
of fascism and is therefore a decisive battle. It-is decisive for the 
whole world war. 
There are three powerful foes confronting Hitler, the Soviet 
Union, Britain and the United States, and the people in the Germanoccupied 
territories. On the eastern front stands the Red Army, 
firm as a rock, whose counter-offensives will continue through the 
whole of the second winter and beyond; it is this force which will 
decide the outcome of the whole war and the destiny of mankind. 
On the western front, even if Britain and the United States continue 
their policy of looking on and stalling, the second front will eventually 
be opened, when the time comes to belabour the slain tiger. 
Then there is the internal front against Hitler, the great uprising 
of the people which is brewing in Germany, in France and in other 
parts of Europe; they will respond with a third front the moment 
the Soviet Union launches an all-out counter-offensive and the guns 
roar on the second front. Thus, an attack from three fronts will 
converge on Hitler  such is the great historical process that will 
follow the Battle of Stalingrad. 
Napoleon¹s political life ended at Waterloo, but the decisive 
turning point was his defeat at Moscow. Hitler today is treading 
Napoleon¹s road, and it is the Battle of Stalingrad that has sealed 
his doom. 
These developments will have a direct impact on the Far East. 
The coming year will not be propitious for Japanese fascism either. 
As time goes on its headaches will grow, until it descends into 
its grave. 
All those who take a pessimistic view of the world situation should 
change their point of view.


IN CELEBRATION OF 
THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION 
November 6, 1942
It is with the greatest optimism that we celebrate the anniversary 
of the October Revolution this year. I firmly believe that this 
anniversary marks the turning point not only of the Soviet-German 
war, but also of the victory of the world anti-fascist front over the 
fascist front. 
Hitler was previously able to keep up the offensive without being 
defeated because the Red Army was alone in resisting fascist Germany 
and its accomplices in Europe. Now the Soviet Union has 
grown more powerful in the course of the war and Hitler¹s second 
summer offensive has failed. Henceforward the task of the world 
anti-fascist front is to take the offensive against the fascist front and 
inflict final defeat on fascism. 
The warriors of the Red Army at Stalingrad have performed 
prodigies of heroism which will affect the destiny of mankind. They 
are the sons and daughters of the October Revolution. The banner 
of the October Revolution is invincible, and all the forces of fascism 
are doomed to extinction. 
In celebrating the victory of the Red Army, we the Chinese people 
are also celebrating our own victory. Our War of Resistance Against 
Japan has been going on for more than five years, and although there 
are still difficulties ahead the dawn of victory is already in sight. 
Victory over the Japanese fascists is not only certain but is not far off. 
It is the task of the Chinese people to concentrate every effort on 
beating the Japanese fascists.

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR 
December 1942
The general policy guiding our economic and financial work is 
to develop the economy and ensure supplies. But many of our comrades 
place one-sided stress on public finance and do not understand 
the importance of the economy as a whole; engrossed in matters of 
revenue and expenditure as such, they cannot find solutions to any 
problem hard as they try. The reason is that an outmoded and conservative 
notion is doing mischief in their minds. They do not know 
that while a good or a bad financial policy affects the economy, it is 
the economy that determines finance. Without a well-based economy 
it is impossible to solve financial difficulties, and without a growing 
economy it is impossible to attain financial sufficiency. The financial 
problem in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region is that of supplying 
funds for the living and operating expenses of tens of thousands 
of troops and civilian personnel, in other words, the problem of 
supplying funds for waging the war. These funds come partly from 
taxes paid by the people and partly from production carried on by 
the tens of thousands of troops and civilian personnel themselves. 
We shall simply be resigning ourselves to extinction unless we develop 
both the private and the public sectors of the economy. Financial 
difficulties can be overcome only by down-to-earth and effective 
economic development. To neglect economic development and the 
This article, originally entitled ³A Basic Summing-Up of Our Past Work². 
was the first chapter of Economic and Financial Problems, a report delivered by 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung at a conference of senior cadres of the Shensi-Kansu- 
Ningsia Border Region. The years 1941 and 1942 were the hardest for the Liberated 
Areas in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The savage attacks by the Japanese 
invaders and the encirclement and blockade by the Kuomintang created enormous 
financial difficulties for the Liberated Areas. Comrade Mao Tse-tung pointed out 
that in order to overcome these difficulties it was necessary for the Party to exert 
111

112 MAO TSE-TUNG 
opening up of sources of finance, and instead to hope for the solution 
of financial difficulties by curtailing indispensable expenditures, is a 
conservative notion which cannot solve any problem. 
In the last five years we have passed through several stages. Our 
worst difficulties occurred in 1940 and 1941, when the Kuomintang 
created friction by its two anti-Communist drives. For a time we had 
a very acute scarcity of clothing, cooking oil, paper and vegetables, 
of footwear for our soldiers and of winter bedding for our civilian 
personnel. The Kuomintang tried to strangle us by cutting off the 
funds due to us and imposing an economic blockade; we were indeed 
in dire straits. But we pulled through. Not only did the people of 
the Border Region provide us with grain but, in particular, we 
resolutely built up the public sector of our economy with our own 
hands. The government established many industries to meet the needs 
of the Border Region, the troops engaged in an extensive production 
campaign and expanded agriculture, industry and commerce to supply 
their own needs, and the tens of thousands of people in the various 
organizations and schools also developed similar economic activities 
for their own support. This self-supporting economy, which has been 
developed by the troops and the various organizations and schools, 
is a special product of the special conditions of today. It would be 
unreasonable and incomprehensible in other historical conditions, but 
it is perfectly reasonable and necessary at present. It is by such means 
that we have been overcoming our difficulties. Do not these indisputable 
historical facts prove the truth that supplies can be ensured only through 
itself in leading the people in developing agriculture and other branches of production, 
and he called upon the government and other organizations, the schools and 
the army in the Liberated Areas to produce as much as possible for their own 
support. Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s Economic and Financial Problems and his articles 
³Spread the Campaigns to Reduce Rent, Increase Production and Support the 
Government and Cherish the People¹ in the Base Areas² and ³Get Organized!² 
formed the Party¹s basic programme for leading the production campaign in the 
Liberated Areas. Comrade Mao Tse-tung here severely criticizes the mistaken notion 
of concentrating on public revenue and expenditure to the neglect of economic 
development, and the wrong working style of making demands on the people 
without mobilizing and helping them to develop production and surmount difficulties, 
and he set forth the Party¹s correct policy of ³developing the economy and 
ensuring supplies². With this policy great successes were achieved in the production 
campaign which was unfolded in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and in 
the Liberated Areas behind the enemy lines. It not only enabled the armed forces 
and the people of the Liberated Areas successfully to tide over the most difficult 
period of the war, but also provided the Party with a rich store of experience for 
guiding economic construction in later years.

113 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
economic development? While we still face many difficulties, the 
foundation of the public sector of our economy has already been laid. 
In another year, by the end of 1943, this foundation will be even firmer. 
Developing the economy is the correct line, but development does 
not mean reckless or ill-founded expansion. Some comrades who disregard 
the specific conditions here and now are setting up an empty 
clamour for development; for example, they are demanding the 
establishment of heavy industry and putting forward plans for huge 
salt and armament industries, all of which are unrealistic and unacceptable. 
The Party¹s line is the correct line for development; it 
opposes outmoded and conservative notions on the one hand and 
grandiose, empty and unrealistic plans on the other. This is the Party¹s 
struggle on two fronts in financial and economic work. 
While we must develop the public sector of our economy, we 
should not forget the importance of help from the people. They have 
given us grain, 90,000 tan in 1940, 200,000 in 1941 and 160,000 in 
1942,1 thus ensuring food for our troops and civilian personnel. Up to 
the end of 1941, the grain output of the public sector of our agriculture 
was meagre and we relied on the people for grain. We must urge the 
army to produce more grain, but for a time we shall still have to rely 
mainly on the people. Although the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region is in the rear and has not suffered direct war damage, it has 
only 1,500,000 inhabitants, a small population for so large an area, 
and the provision of such large quantities of grain is not easy. Besides, 
the people transport salt for us or pay a salt transport levy, and in 
1941 they purchased five million yuan worth of government bonds; 
all of which represents no small burden. To meet the needs of the 
War of Resistance and national reconstruction, the people must 
shoulder such burdens, the necessity of which they very well realize. 
When the government is in very great difficulties, it is necessary to 
ask the people to bear a heavier burden, and they understand that 
too. But while taking from the people we must at the same time 
help them to replenish and expand their economy. That is to say, 
appropriate steps and methods must be adopted to help the people 
develop their agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, salt industry 
and commerce, so that they gain at the same time as they give and, 
moreover, gain more than they give; only thus can we sustain a long 
war against Japan. 
Disregarding the needs of the war, some comrades insist that the 
government should adopt a policy of ³benevolence². This is a mistake.

114 MAO TSE-TUNG 
For unless we win the war against Japan, such ³benevolence² will 
mean nothing to the people and will benefit only the Japanese imperialists. 
Conversely, although the people have to carry rather heavy 
burdens for the time being, things will get better for them as the 
difficulties confronting the government and the troops are overcome, 
the War of Resistance is sustained and the enemy is defeated; and 
this is where the true benevolence of the revolutionary government lies. 
Another mistake is ³draining the pond to catch the fish², that is, 
making endless demands on the people, disregarding their hardships 
and considering only the needs of the government and the army. That 
is a Kuomintang mode of thinking which we must never adopt. 
Although we have temporarily added to the people¹s burden, we 
have immediately set to work building the public sector of our 
economy. In the years 1941 and 1942 the army, the government and 
other organizations and the schools met most of their needs by their 
own efforts. This is a wonderful achievement without precedent in 
Chinese history, and it contributes to the material basis of our invincibility. 
The greater our self-supporting economic activities, the 
more we shall be able to lighten the people¹s tax burdens. In the first 
stage, from 1937 to 1939, we took very little from them; during this 
stage they were able to build up considerable strength. In the second 
stage, from 1940 to 1942, the burden on the people was increased. 
The third stage will begin in 1943. In the next two years, 1943 and 
1944, if the public sector of our economy continues to grow and if 
all or most of our troops in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region 
are in a position to engage in farming, then by the end of 1944 the 
people¹s burden will again be lightened, and they will again be able 
to build up strength. This is a possibility which we should prepare 
to turn into actuality. 
We must refute all one-sided views and advance the correct slogan 
of our Party, ³Develop the economy and ensure supplies². With 
regard to the relation between public and private interests, our slogans 
are ³Give consideration to both public and private interests² and 
³Give consideration to both troops and civilians². We consider only 
such slogans to be correct. We can guarantee our financial needs only 
by expanding both the public and the private sectors of our economy 
in a realistic and practical way. Even in difficult times we must take 
care to set a limit to taxation so that the burdens, though heavy, will 
not hurt the people. And as soon as we can, we should lighten the 
burdens so that the people can build up strength.

115 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROBLEMS 
The Kuomintang die-hards regard construction in the Border 
Region as a hopeless undertaking and the difficulties here as insurmountable; 
they are expecting the Border Region to collapse any 
day. It is not worth arguing with such people; they will never see 
the day of our ³collapse² and we shall unquestionably grow more 
and more prosperous. They do not understand that under the leadership 
of the Communist Party and the Border Region revolutionary 
government the masses always give their support to the Party and 
government. And the Party and the government will always find ways 
to get over economic and financial difficulties, however serious. In 
fact we have already pulled through some of our recent difficulties 
and will soon overcome others. We encountered difficulties many 
times greater in the past and surmounted them all. With intense 
fighting going on every day, our base areas in northern and central 
China are now facing much greater difficulties than the Shensi-Kansu- 
Ningsia Border Region, but we have already held out for five and a 
half years in these areas and can certainly continue to do so till victory. 
For us, there is no ground for pessimism; we can conquer any difficulty. 
After the present conference of senior cadres of the Shensi-Kansu- 
Ningsia Border Region we shall put into effect the policy of ³better 
troops and simpler administration².2 It must be carried out strictly, 
thoroughly and universally, and not perfunctorily, superficially or 
partially. In carrying it out, we must attain the five objectives 
of simplification, unification, efficiency, economy and opposition to 
bureaucracy. These five objectives have a very important bearing on 
our economic and financial work. Simplification will reduce nonproductive 
expenditures and increase our income from production; it 
will not only have a direct and healthy effect on our finances, but will 
lighten the people¹s burdens and benefit them economically. In our 
economic and financial set-up, we must overcome such evils as disunity, 
assertion of independence and lack of co-ordination, and must 
establish a working system which is unified and responsive to direction 
and which permits the full application of our policies and regulations. 
With the establishment of such a unified system working efficiency 
will rise. All our organizations, and particularly those engaged in 
economic and financial work, must pay attention to thrift. By practising 
thrift we can cut out a great deal of unnecessary and wasteful 
expenditure, which amounts possibly to tens of millions of yuan. 
Finally, people engaged in economic and financial work must 
overcome surviving bureaucratic practices, some of which, such as

116 MAO TSE-TUNG 
corruption and graft, over-elaborate organization, meaningless ³standardization² 
and red tape, are very serious. If we fully attain these 
five objectives in the Party, the government and the army, our policy 
of ³better troops and simpler administration² will achieve its purpose, 
our difficulties will surely be overcome, and we shall silence the gibes 
about our approaching ³collapse².

SOME QUESTIONS 
CONCERNING METHODS OF LEADERSHIP 
June 12, 1943
1. There are two methods which we Communists must employ 
in whatever work we do. One is to combine the general with the 
particular; the other is to combine the leadership with the masses. 
2. In any task, if no general and widespread call is issued, the 
broad masses cannot be mobilized for action. But if persons in leading 
positions confine themselves to a general call  if they do not personally, 
in some of the organizations, go deeply and concretely into 
the work called for, make a break-through at some single point, gain 
experience and use this experience for guiding other units  then 
they will have no way of testing the correctness or of enriching the 
content of their general call, and there is the danger that nothing 
may come of it. In the rectification movement of 1942, for example, 
there were achievements wherever the method of combining the 
general call with particular and specific guidance was used, but there 
were no achievements wherever this method was not used. In the 
rectification movement of 1943, each bureau and sub-bureau of the 
Central Committee and each area and prefectural Party committee, 
in addition to making a general call (a rectification plan for the whole 
year), must do the following things, gaining experience in the process. 
Select two or three units (but not too many) from the organization 
itself and from other organizations, schools or army units in the 
vicinity. Make a thorough study of those units, acquire a detailed 
knowledge of the development of the rectification movement in them 
and a detailed knowledge of the political history, the ideological 
characteristics, the zeal in study and the strong and weak points in 
the work of some (again not too many) representative members of 
This decision on methods of leadership was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung 
for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. 
117

118 MAO TSE-TUNG 
their personnel. Furthermore, give personal guidance to those in 
charge to find concrete solutions for the practical problems facing 
those units. The leaders in every organization, school or army unit 
must do likewise, as each of these has a number of subordinate units. 
Moreover, this is the method by which the leaders combine leading 
and learning. No one in a leading position is competent to give 
general guidance to all the units unless he derives concrete experience 
from particular individuals and events in particular subordinate units. 
This method must be promoted everywhere so that leading cadres at 
all levels learn to apply it. 
3. Experience in the 1942 rectification movement also proves it 
is essential for the success of the rectification that a leading group 
should be formed in each unit in the course of the movement, made 
up of a small number of activists and with the heads of the given 
unit as its nucleus, and that this leading group should link itself closely 
with the masses taking part in the movement. However active the 
leading group may be, its activity will amount to fruitless effort by 
a handful of people unless combined with the activity of the masses. 
On the other hand, if the masses alone are active without a strong 
leading group to organize their activity properly, such activity cannot 
be sustained for long, or carried forward in the right direction, or 
raised to a high level. The masses in any given place are generally 
composed of three parts, the relatively active, the intermediate and 
the relatively backward. The leaders must therefore be skilled in 
uniting the small number of active elements around the leadership 
and must rely on them to raise the level of the intermediate elements 
and to win over the backward elements. A leading group that is 
genuinely united and linked with the masses can be formed only 
gradually in the process of mass struggle, and not in isolation from 
it. In the process of a great struggle, the composition of the leading 
group in most cases should not and cannot remain entirely unchanged 
throughout the initial, middle and final stages; the activists who come 
forward in the course of the struggle must constantly be promoted to 
replace those original members of the leading group who are inferior 
by comparison or who have degenerated. One fundamental reason 
why the work in many places and many organizations cannot be 
pushed ahead is the lack of a leading group which is united, linked 
with the masses and kept constantly healthy. A school of a hundred 
people certainly cannot be run well if it does not have a leading group 
of several people, or a dozen or more, which is formed in accordance

119 CONCERNING METHODS OF LEADERSHIP 
with the actual circumstances (and not thrown together artificially) 
and is composed of the most active, upright and alert of the teachers, 
the other staff and the students. In every organization, school, army 
unit, factory or village, whether large or small, we should give effect 
to the ninth of Stalin¹s twelve conditions for the bolshevization of 
the Party, namely, that on the establishment of a nucleus of leadership.
1 The criteria for such a leading group should be the four which 
Dimitrov enumerated in his discussion of cadres policy  absolute 
devotion to the cause, contact with the masses, ability independently 
to find one¹s bearings and observance of discipline.2 Whether in carrying 
out the central tasks  war, production, education (including 
rectification)  or in checking-up on work, examining the cadres¹ 
histories, or in other activities, it is necessary to adopt the method of 
linking the leading group with the masses, in addition to that of 
linking the general call with particular guidance. 
4. In all the practical work of our Party, all correct leadership 
is necessarily ³from the masses, to the masses². This means: take the 
ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate 
them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic 
ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas 
until the masses embrace them as their own, hold fast to them and 
translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in 
such action. Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and 
once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and 
carried through. And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral, 
with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each 
time. Such is the Marxist theory of knowledge. 
5. The concept of a correct relationship between the leading 
group and the masses in an organization or in a struggle, the concept 
that correct ideas on the part of the leadership can only be ³from the 
masses, to the masses², and the concept that the general call must 
be combined with particular guidance when the leadership¹s ideas are 
being put into practice  these concepts must be propagated everywhere 
during the present rectification movement in order to correct 
the mistaken viewpoints among our cadres on these questions. Many 
comrades do not see the importance of, or are not good at, drawing 
together the activists to form a nucleus of leadership, and they do 
not see the importance of, or are not good at, linking this nucleus of 
leadership closely with the masses, and so their leadership becomes 
bureaucratic and divorced from the masses. Many comrades do not

120 MAO TSE-TUNG 
see the importance of, or are not good at, summing up the experience 
of mass struggles, but fancying themselves clever, are fond of voicing 
their subjectivist ideas, and so their ideas become empty and impractical. 
Many comrades rest content with making a general call 
with regard to a task and do not see the importance of, or are not 
good at, following it up immediately with particular and concrete 
guidance, and so their call remains on their lips, or on paper or in the 
conference room, and their leadership becomes bureaucratic. In the 
present rectification movement we must correct these defects and learn 
to use the methods of combining the leadership with the masses and 
the general with the particular in our study, in the check-up on work and 
in the examination of cadres¹ histories; and we must also apply 
these methods in all our future work. 
6. Take the ideas of the masses and concentrate them, then go 
to the masses, persevere in the ideas and carry them through, so as 
to form correct ideas of leadership  such is the basic method of 
leadership. In the process of concentrating ideas and persevering in 
them, it is necessary to use the method of combining the general call 
with particular guidance, and this is a component part of the basic 
method. Formulate general ideas (general calls) out of the particular 
guidance given in a number of cases, and put them to the test in many 
different units (not only doing so yourself, but by telling others to do 
the same); then concentrate the new experience (sum it up) and draw 
up new directives for the guidance of the masses generally. Comrades 
should do this in the present rectification movement, and also in 
every other kind of work. Better leadership comes with greater skill 
in doing this. 
7. In relaying to subordinate units any task (whether it concerns 
the revolutionary war, production or education; the rectification 
movement, check-up on work or the examination of cadres¹ histories; 
propaganda work, organizational work or anti-espionage, or other 
work), a higher organization and its departments should in all cases 
go through the leader of the lower organization concerned so that he 
may assume responsibility; in this way both division of labour and 
unified centralized leadership are achieved. A department at a higher 
level should not go solely to its counterpart at the lower level (for 
instance, a higher department concerned with organization, propaganda 
or anti-espionage should not go solely to the corresponding 
department at the lower level), leaving the person in over-all charge 
of the lower organization (such as the secretary, the chairman, the

121 CONCERNING METHODS OF LEADERSHIP 
director or the school principal) in ignorance or without responsibility. 
Both the person in over-all charge and the person with specific 
responsibility should be informed and given responsibility. This 
centralized method, combining division of labour with unified leadership, 
makes it possible, through the person with over-all responsibility, 
to mobilize a large number of cadres  on occasion even an organization¹s 
entire personnel  to carry out a particular task, and thus to 
overcome shortages of cadres in individual departments and turn a 
good number of people into active cadres for the work in hand. This, 
too, is a way of combining the leadership with the masses. Take, for 
instance, the examining of cadres¹ histories. If the job is done in 
isolation, if it is done only by the few people in the organization 
department in charge of such work, it certainly cannot be done well. 
But if it is done through the administrative head of a particular 
organization or school, who mobilizes many or even all of his staff, 
or many or even all of his students, to take part in the work, while 
at the same time the leading members of the organization department 
at the higher level give correct guidance, applying the principle of 
linking the leadership with the masses, then undoubtedly the task of 
examining the cadres¹ histories will be satisfactorily accomplished. 
8. In any given place, there cannot be a number of central tasks 
at the same time. At any one time there can be only one central task, 
supplemented by other tasks of a second or third order of importance. 
Consequently, the person with over-all responsibility in the locality 
must take into account the history and circumstances of the struggle 
there and put the different tasks in their proper order; he should 
not act upon each instruction as it comes from the higher organization 
without any planning of his own, and thereby create a multitude 
of ³central tasks² and a state of confusion and disorder. Nor should 
a higher organization simultaneously assign many tasks to a lower 
organization without indicating their relative importance and urgency 
or without specifying which is central, for that will lead to confusion 
in the steps to be taken by the lower organizations in their work and 
thus no definite results will be achieved. It is part of the art of leadership 
to take the whole situation into account and plan accordingly 
in the light of the historical conditions and existing circumstances 
of each locality, decide correctly on the centre of gravity and the 
sequence of the work for each period, steadfastly carry through the 
decision, and make sure that definite results are achieved. This is 
also a problem of method of leadership, and care must be taken to

122 MAO TSE-TUNG 
solve it when applying the principles of combining the leadership with 
the masses and the general with the particular. 
9. Details concerning methods of leadership are not dealt with 
here; it is hoped that comrades in all localities will themselves do 
some hard thinking and give full play to their own creativeness on 
the basis of the principles here set forth. The harder the struggle, 
the greater the need for Communists to link their leadership closely 
with the demands of the vast masses, and to combine general calls 
closely with particular guidance, so as to smash the subjectivist and 
bureaucratic methods of leadership completely. All the leading comrades 
of our Party must at all times counterpose scientific, Marxist 
methods of leadership to subjectivist, bureaucratic methods of leadership 
and use the former to overcome the latter. Subjectivists and 
bureaucrats do not understand the principles of combining the leadership 
with the masses and the general with the particular; they greatly 
impede the development of the work of the Party. To combat 
subjectivist and bureaucratic methods of leadership, we must 
promote scientific, Marxist methods of leadership both extensively 
and intensively.

SOME POINTED QUESTIONS 
FOR THE KUOMINTANG 
July 12, 1943
The last few months have witnessed a most unusual and shocking 
event inside China¹s anti-Japanese camp, namely, the campaign 
launched by many Kuomintang-led party, government and army 
organizations to wreck unity and undermine the War of Resistance. 
It assumes the form of an attack on the Communist Party, but is in 
fact directed against the whole Chinese nation and people. 
Consider first the Kuomintang armies. Of the Kuomintang-led 
armies throughout the country, as many as three group armies from 
the main forces are stationed in the Northwest  the 34th, 37th and 
38th Group Armies, all under Hu Tsung-nan, Deputy Commander-in- 
Chief of the 8th War Zone. Of these, two have been used to encircle 
the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, while only one has been 
assigned defence duty along the Yellow River, from Yichuan to 
Tungkuan, against the Japanese invaders. This has been the situation 
for more than four years, and people became accustomed to it 
so long as there was no military clash. But in the last few days 
an unexpected change has taken place. Of the three army corps on 
defence duty along the river  the 1st, 16th and 90th Army Corps  
two have been removed, the 1st Army Corps to the area of Pinchow 
and Chunhua and the 90th to the area of Lochuan, and both are 
actively preparing to attack the Border Region, while the greater 
part of the river defences is left unmanned against the Japanese 
invaders. 
This inevitably makes people ask: What exactly are the relations 
between these Kuomintang people and the Japanese? 
Day in day out many Kuomintang people have been brazenly 
spreading propaganda that the Communist Party is ³sabotaging the 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote this editorial for the Liberation Daily, Yenan. 
123

124 MAO TSE-TUNG 
War of Resistance² and ³wrecking unity². Can the withdrawal of 
the main forces defending the river be called strengthening the War 
of Resistance? Can attacks on the Border Region be called strengthening 
unity? 
We should like to ask the Kuomintang people who are doing 
all this: You are turning your backs on the Japanese while they are 
still facing you. What is going to happen if the Japanese start advancing 
on your heels? 
What is the meaning of your abandonment of large sections of 
the river defences while the Japanese quietly look on from the other 
bank, without making any move other than to watch with glee 
through their field-glasses the gradually receding view of your backs? 
Why do the Japanese so greatly prefer seeing your backs? And what 
makes you feel so much at ease after abandoning the river defences 
and leaving large sections unmanned? 
In a society based on private property, people usually bolt their 
doors at night before going to bed. Everybody knows that this is 
not fussiness but a precaution against burglars. Now, having left 
the front door wide open, are you not afraid of burglars coming? And 
if the front door is left wide open without the burglars coming, what 
then is the reason? 
According to you, in China it is the Communists who are ³sabotaging 
the War of Resistance², while you yourselves are most 
devoted to ³the nation above all². Well now, what are you placing 
³above all² when you turn your backs on the enemy? 
According to you, it is also the Communists who are ³wrecking 
unity², while you are so very devoted to ³unity in good faith². Well, 
you have sent a huge force of three group armies (minus one army 
corps), with fixed bayonets and heavy artillery, to march against the 
people of the Border Region; can this be counted as ³unity in 
good faith²? 
Or take another of your assertions  that you are very keen not 
on ³unity² but on ³unification²  and you therefore want to wipe 
out the Border Region, liquidate ³feudal separatism² and kill off 
every Communist. Very well! How is it then you are not afraid that 
the Japanese will ³unify² the Chinese nation, including you, out 
of existence? 
Supposing that while you triumphantly ³unify² the Border Region 
at one stroke and wipe out the Communists, you are able to keep 
the Japanese stupefied by some ³sleeping-draught² or by some ³spell²

125 SOME POINTED QUESTIONS FOR THE KUOMINTANG 
of yours, so that the nation and you yourselves both escape ³unification² 
by them. Well, dear gentlemen of the Kuomintang, won¹t you 
give us some inkling of the secret of your sleeping-draught or spell? 
But if you have no sleeping-draught or spell for dealing with the 
Japanese, and if you have not reached a secret understanding with 
them, then let us tell you plainly and formally: you should not and 
must not attack the Border Region. ³When the snipe and the clam 
grapple, it is the fisherman who profits², ³The mantis stalks the 
cicada, but behind them lurks the oriole²  there is truth in these 
two parables. The proper thing for you to do is to join forces with 
us to ³unify² the territory occupied by the Japanese and drive the 
devils out. What is the reason for your anxiety and hurry to ³unify² 
the span of land forming the Border Region? Though vast stretches 
of our beautiful country have fallen into the hands of the enemy, 
you are not anxious or in a hurry about this, but instead are anxious 
to attack the Border Region and in a hurry to crush the Communist 
Party. How painful! How disgraceful! 
Next, consider the activities of the Kuomintang Party. To combat 
the Communist Party the Kuomintang has organized several hundred 
detachments of secret agents, into which it has recruited all kinds 
of scoundrels. For example, on July 6, 1943, in the 32nd year of the 
Chinese Republic, on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the War 
of Resistance, the Kuomintang Central News Agency released a 
news item stating that certain ³cultural associations² in Sian, Shensi 
Province, had held a meeting and resolved to cable Mao Tse-tung, 
calling on him to use the opportunity of the dissolution of the Third 
International to ³dissolve² the Communist Party of China and, in 
addition, to ³abolish the separatist Border Region regime². The reader 
may well take this to be ³news², but actually it is an old story. 
It turns out that the whole thing was the handiwork of one of 
the several hundred detachments of secret agents. Acting on orders 
from headquarters (namely, ³The Bureau of Investigation and Statistics 
of the Military Council of the National Government² and ³The Bureau 
of Investigation and Statistics of the Central Executive Committee 
of the Kuomintang²), this detachment gave instructions to the 
Trotskyite and traitor Chang Ti-fei, who is now Director of Discipline 
in the Sian concentration camp and notorious for his anti- 
Communist writings in Resistance and Culture, a traitorous periodical 
financed by the Kuomintang; on June 12, that is, twenty-five days 
before the Central News Agency released its news item, he mustered

126 MAO TSE-TUNG 
together nine people in a ten-minute meeting which ³endorsed² the 
text of the so-called telegram. 
This telegram has not reached Yenan to this day but its contents 
are clear. It says, we are told, that since the Third International 
has been dissolved, the Communist Party of China should likewise 
be ³dissolved², that ³Marxism-Leninism has been discredited², and 
so on and so forth. 
There it is. This is the sort of thing the Kuomintang are saying! 
We have always believed that anything may issue from the mouths 
of the likes of these Kuomintang creatures (and like attracts like), 
and as one would expect, they have now let out this gust of foul air! 
There are now many political parties in China  there are even 
two Kuomintangs. One is the Wang Ching-wei brand of Kuomintang, 
set up in Nanking and elsewhere, which also has a flag with a white 
sun against a blue sky and a so-called Central Executive Committee, 
as well as a collection of secret police detachments. In addition, everywhere 
in the occupied areas there are the fascist parties created by 
the Japanese. 
Dear gentlemen of the Kuomintang! Why is it that since the 
dissolution of the Third International you have been so terribly busy 
plotting the ³dissolution² of the Communist Party but will not even 
lift a finger to dissolve a few of the traitorous and Japanese-sponsored 
parties? When you directed Chang Ti-fei to draft the telegram, why 
is it that, besides demanding the dissolution of the Communist Party, 
you did not deign to add that the traitorous and Japanese-sponsored 
parties, too, ought to be dissolved? 
Is it possible that you think there is one Communist Party too 
many? In the whole of China there is only one Communist Party, 
while there are two Kuomintangs. After all, of which party is there 
one too many? 
Gentlemen of the Kuomintang! Have you ever given the following 
matter a thought? Why is it that, in addition to yourselves, 
both the Japanese and Wang Ching-wei are making frantic efforts 
to overthrow the Communist Party, asserting that the Communist 
Party alone is one too many and must therefore be crushed? And 
why is it that they feel there are too few Kuomintangs and there 
never can be too many, and that they are everywhere grooming and 
fostering the Wang Ching-wei brand of Kuomintang? 
Gentlemen of the Kuomintang! We don¹t mind taking the trouble 
to tell you that the Japanese and Wang Ching-wei have a special

127 SOME POINTED QUESTIONS FOR THE KUOMINTANG 
love for the Kuomintang and the Three People¹s Principles because 
they find something in both they can turn to good account. The only 
time since World War I that the imperialists and traitors had no 
love for the Kuomintang but bitterly hated it and tried their utmost 
to abolish it was in the period of 1924-27, when it was reorganized 
by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, admitted Communists into its ranks and became 
a national alliance in which the Kuomintang and the Communist 
Party co-operated. The only time that the imperialists and traitors 
had no love for the Three People¹s Principles but bitterly hated them 
and tried their utmost to abolish them was also in the same period, 
when these principles were transformed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen into 
the revolutionary Three People¹s Principles as set out in the Manifesto 
of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. Save for 
that period, the Kuomintang has thrown out the Communists and 
the Three People¹s Principles have been emptied of Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s 
revolutionary spirit, and both have therefore earned the love of all 
the imperialists and traitors and, for the same reasons, have earned 
the love of the Japanese fascists and the traitor Wang Ching-wei, 
who are grooming and fostering them like treasured possessions. 
There used to be a yellow patch in the upper left-hand corner of the 
flag of Wang Ching-wei¹s brand of Kuomintang to distinguish it 
from the other Kuomintang, but now even that has been removed 
and everything is made to look the same so as not to offend the 
eye. What great love! 
Kuomintang specimens of the Wang Ching-wei brand are numerous 
in the Great Rear Area as well as in the occupied areas. 
Some are under cover, forming the enemy¹s fifth column. Others are 
in the open, depending for their food and keep upon the Kuomintang 
or upon their work as police agents, doing nothing at all to resist 
Japan but specializing in anti-communism. Though they do not wear 
Wang Ching-wei labels, these people are really his men. They, too, 
are enemy fifth-columnists, only they use a somewhat different guise 
in order to conceal their identity and fool people. 
The whole thing is now perfectly clear. When you instructed 
Chang Ti-fei to draft the telegram demanding the ³dissolution² of 
the Communist Party, the reason why you would in no circumstances 
trouble to add that the Japanese-sponsored parties and traitor parties 
should also be dissolved is that you have much in common with them 
in ideology, policy and organization, and that the fundamental feature of 
your common ideology is opposition to communism and to the people.

128 MAO TSE-TUNG 
We want to ask you Kuomintang people yet another question. 
Is it true that the only ³discredited² ism in China and indeed in the 
whole world is Marxism-Leninism and that all the others are great 
stuff? Apart from Wang Ching-wei¹s brand of the Three People¹s 
Principles which we have just mentioned, what about the fascism 
of Hitler, Mussolini and Hideki Tojo? What about the Trotskyism of 
Chang Ti-fei? What about the counter-revolutionary doctrines of the 
various brands of counter-revolutionary secret services in China? 
Dear gentlemen of the Kuomintang! Why is it that when you 
instructed Chang Ti-fei to draft the telegram, you did not add a 
single phrase or proviso about all these so-called isms which are 
about as much good as the plague, or bedbugs, or dog¹s droppings? 
Is it possible that in your eyes all this counter-revolutionary rubbish 
is flawless and perfect, while Marxism-Leninism alone is completely 
discredited? 
To be blunt, we strongly suspect that you are working in collusion 
with the Japanese-sponsored and traitorous parties, and that is why 
you and they ³breathe through the same nostrils², that is why you 
and the enemy and traitors are so exactly alike, indeed, identical 
and indistinguishable both in your words and in your deeds. The 
Japanese and the traitors wanted the New Fourth Army disbanded, 
and you ordered it to be disbanded; they want to dissolve the Communist 
Party, and so do you; they want to abolish the Border Region, 
and so do you; they do not want you to defend the Yellow River, 
and so you abandon its defence; they attack the Border Region 
(for the last six years the enemy forces along the river bank opposite 
the counties of Suiteh, Michih, Chiahsien, Wupao and Chingchien have 
never ceased shelling the Eighth Route Army¹s river defences), and 
you too intend to attack it; they are anti-Communist, and so are 
you; they bitterly revile communism and liberal ideas, and so do you; 
when they seize a Communist, they force him to make a public recantation 
in the press, and so do you; they send counter-revolutionary 
agents to worm their way into the Communist Party and the 
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies for disruptive purposes, and 
so do you. How is it that you and they are so remarkably alike, 
identical and indistinguishable? As you and the enemy and the 
traitors are exactly alike, identical and indistinguishable in so many 
words and deeds, how can people help suspecting that you are working 
hand in glove with them or have come to some secret understanding 
with them?

129 SOME POINTED QUESTIONS FOR THE KUOMINTANG 
We hereby make this formal protest to the Central Executive 
Committee of the Kuomintang: Your action in withdrawing the main 
forces for river defence in preparation for attacking the Border Region 
and starting civil war is utterly wrong and impermissible. Your 
Central News Agency¹s publication of the news item of July 6, which 
is disruptive of unity and insulting to the Communist Party, is also 
utterly wrong and impermissible. Both these errors are towering 
crimes, indistinguishable from those committed by the enemy and 
the traitors. You must correct them. 
We hereby make this formal demand to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, 
Director-General of the Kuomintang: Please order Hu Tsung-nan¹s 
troops to return to the river defences, please discipline the Central 
News Agency and punish the traitor Chang Ti-fei. 
We hereby appeal to all true patriots among the Kuomintang 
members who do not approve of the withdrawal of the river defence 
forces for the purpose of attacking the Border Region and do not 
approve of the demand for the dissolution of the Communist Party: 
please act now to avert the crisis of civil war. We are willing to 
co-operate with you to the very end to save the nation. 
We believe that these are absolutely just demands.


SPREAD THE CAMPAIGNS 
TO REDUCE RENT, INCREASE PRODUCTION 
AND ³SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT 
AND CHERISH THE PEOPLE² 
IN THE BASE AREAS 
October 1, 1943
1. As the time for autumn harvest is come, the leading bodies 
in the base areas must ask Party and government organizations at 
all levels to check up on the application of our policy of rent reduction. 
Wherever it has not been carried out in earnest, rents must 
be reduced this year without any exception. Wherever this work 
has not been thorough, it must be done thoroughly this year. Party 
committees should immediately issue directives based on the agrarian 
policy of the Central Committee and conforming to local conditions, 
and they should inspect a few villages at first hand, pick out good 
examples and so expedite the work in other places. At the same time, 
the press should carry editorials on rent reduction and reports of 
good examples. As rent reduction is a mass struggle by the peasants, 
Party directives and government decrees should guide and help it 
instead of trying to bestow favours on the masses. To bestow rent 
reduction as a favour instead of arousing the masses to achieve it by 
their own action is wrong, and the results will not be solid. Peasant 
organizations should be formed or reconstituted in the struggle for 
rent reduction. The government¹s position should be one of enforcing 
the decree on rent reduction and adjusting the relative interests of 
the landlords and the tenants. Now that the base areas have shrunk 
in size, it is of more immediate importance than at any time in 
the past six years for the Party to win the masses there by patient, 
This inner-Party directive was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung on behalf 
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. 
131

132 MAO TSE-TUNG 
conscientious and thorough work, and to share weal and woe with 
them. If during this autumn we check on how far the policy has been 
carried out and perform the task of rent reduction thoroughly, we 
shall be able to arouse the initiative of the peasant masses and, in the 
coming year, intensify our struggle against the enemy and give impetus 
to the production campaign. 
2. In the base areas behind the enemy lines most cadres have 
not yet learned how to get the personnel of the Party and government 
organizations, the troops and the people (including everyone, men 
and women, old and young, soldiers and civilians, and people in 
public and private employment) to undertake production on a wide 
scale. During this autumn and winter the Party committee, the 
government and the army in each base area must get ready to launch 
a big area-wide production campaign next year, covering both public 
and private farming, industry, handicrafts, transport, animal husbandry 
and commerce, with the main emphasis on farming  a campaign 
for overcoming difficulties by our own efforts (the slogan of 
³ample food and clothing² should not be raised for the time being 
except in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region). There should 
be planning household by household and mutual aid in labour (known 
as labour-exchange teams in northern Shensi and once known as 
ploughing teams or mutual-aid working groups in the former Red 
areas in Kiangsi), labour heroes should be rewarded, emulation in 
production should be practised and co-operatives serving the masses 
should be promoted. In the financial and economic field, the Party 
and government personnel at the county and district levels should 
devote nine-tenths of their energy to helping the peasants increase 
production, and only one-tenth to collecting taxes from them. If pains 
are taken with the first task, the second will be easy. In the present 
war conditions all organizations, schools and army units must make 
great efforts to grow vegetables, breed pigs, collect firewood, make 
charcoal, expand handicrafts and raise part of their own grain supply. 
Apart from the development of collective production in all units, 
whether big or small, every individual (except for those in the army) 
should also be encouraged to engage in some spare-time agricultural 
or handicraft production (but not in trade), the proceeds of which 
he can keep for himself. Seven to ten-day training courses should 
be given on vegetable-growing and pig-farming, and on the preparation 
of better food by the cooks. Thrift should be stressed, waste 
combated and corrupt practices forbidden in all Party, government

133 CAMPAIGNS IN BASE AREAS 
and army organizations. At all levels, the leading personnel in the 
Party, government and army organizations and in the schools should 
master all the skills involved in leading the masses in production. 
No one who fails to study production carefully can be considered a 
good leader. Any soldier or civilian who is not serious about production 
and who likes to eat but does not like to work cannot be considered 
a good soldier or a good citizen. Village Party members who are not 
diverted from production should realize that one of the qualifications 
for becoming a model among the masses is to work well in increasing 
production. In the campaign for production, it is wrong to take a 
conservative and purely financial point of view which concentrates 
on revenue and expenditure to the neglect of economic development. 
It is wrong to have a handful of government functionaries busying 
themselves with collecting grain and taxes, funds and food supplies 
to the neglect of organizing the enormous labour power of the rank 
and file of the Party, the government and the army, and that of the 
people, for a mass campaign of production. It is wrong simply to 
demand grain and money from the masses (as does the Kuomintang) 
without making every effort to help them to increase production. 
It is wrong to have a few economic departments organizing a small 
number of people for production and to neglect the launching of 
extensive mass campaigns for production. It is wrong to consider it 
dishonourable and selfish either for Communists in the countryside 
to engage in household production in order to support their families 
or for Communists in government organizations and schools to 
engage in private spare-time production in order to improve their 
own living conditions, for all such activity is in the interests of the 
revolutionary cause. It is wrong simply to exhort people in any base 
area to endure hardship in the bitter struggle without encouraging 
them to increase production and thereby try to improve their material 
conditions. It is wrong to regard the co-operatives as money-making 
concerns run for the benefit of the small number of functionaries or 
as stores run by the government and not as economic organizations 
run by and for the masses. It is wrong not to introduce the model 
methods of work used by some of the agricultural labour heroes of 
the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region (e.g., mutual aid in labour, 
repeated ploughing, frequent hoeing and ample manuring) on the 
pretext that these methods are not applicable in certain base areas. 
It is wrong, in production campaigns, to shift the task of production 
to the heads of the local departments in charge of economic

134 MAO TSE-TUNG 
development, the army supply chiefs or the administration chiefs in 
governmental and other bodies, instead of ensuring that the leading 
cadres themselves assume responsibility and participate personally, 
that the leading group links itself closely with the masses and general 
calls are combined with particular and specific guidance, that investigation 
and study are undertaken and priority is given to what is 
urgent and important, that efforts are made to bring everyone into 
production  men and women, young and old, and even the loafers 
 and that cadres are trained and the masses given education. In 
the present circumstances the organization of labour power is the key 
to increasing production. In each of the base areas, even under present 
war conditions, it is possible and altogether necessary to organize the 
labour power of tens of thousands of men and women in the Party, 
the government offices and the army, and hundreds of thousands of 
the people for production purposes (i.e., to organize on a voluntary 
basis all people who are capable of performing part-time or full-time 
labour, using the forms of household-by-household planning, labourexchange 
teams, transport teams, mutual-aid working groups or 
co-operatives, and keeping to the principle of exchange of equal 
values). Communist Party members must attain a full grasp of all 
the principles and methods of organizing labour power. Rent reduction 
carried out universally and thoroughly in all the base areas this 
year will stimulate a broad increase in production next year. And the 
great production campaign that will be carried on next year by Party 
and government, soldiers and civilians, men and women, and young 
and old, to increase the supply of grain and other necessities and to 
prepare against natural disasters, will lay the material foundation 
for the continued maintenance of the anti-Japanese base areas. Otherwise, 
we will encounter grave difficulties. 
3. For the Party, the government and the army to be at one with 
the people in developing next year¹s anti-Japanese struggle and campaign 
for production, the Party committees and the leading army 
and government bodies in every single base area should prepare to 
launch a large-scale mass campaign in the first month of the coming 
lunar year to ³support the government and cherish the people² and 
to ³support the army and give preferential treatment to the families 
of soldiers who are fighting the Japanese². The troops should publicly 
renew their pledge to ³support the government and cherish the people², 
hold meetings for self-criticism, arrange get-togethers with the 
local people (to which representatives of the local Party and govern

135 CAMPAIGNS IN BASE AREAS 
ment organizations should also be invited), and apologize and give 
compensation for any past infringements upon the interests of the 
masses. Under the leadership of the local Party, government and 
mass organizations, the masses on their side should publicly renew 
their pledge to support the army and give preferential treatment to 
the families of the soldiers fighting the Japanese, and should set going 
an ardent campaign for greetings and gifts to the army units. In the 
course of these campaigns, the army on its side and the Party and 
the government on theirs should thoroughly examine the shortcomings 
and mistakes of 1943, and should resolutely correct them in 1944. 
From now on, such campaigns should be launched everywhere in the 
first month of every lunar year, and in the course of them the pledges 
to ³support the government and cherish the people² and ³support the 
army and give preferential treatment to the families of the soldiers 
who are fighting the Japanese² should be read out time and again, 
and there should be repeated self-criticism before the masses of any 
high-handed behaviour by the troops in the base areas towards the 
Party or government personnel or towards civilians, or of any lack 
of concern for the troops shown by the Party or government personnel 
or the civilians (each side criticizing itself and not the other) in order 
that these shortcomings and mistakes may be thoroughly corrected.


A COMMENT 
ON THE SESSIONS OF THE KUOMINTANG 
CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND 
OF THE PEOPLE¹S POLITICAL COUNCIL 
October 5, 1943 
The Kuomintang held the Eleventh Plenary Session of its Central 
Executive Committee from September 6 to 13, and the Kuomintang 
government held the Second Session of the Third People¹s Political 
Council from September 18 to 27. Now that all the documents of both 
these meetings are at hand, we can make a general comment. 
The international situation is on the threshold of a great change, 
whose imminence is sensed on all sides. The European Axis Powers 
have sensed it, and Hitler is adopting a desperate last-ditch policy. 
In the main, it is the Soviet Union that is bringing this change about. 
The Soviet Union is now taking advantage of it  the Red Army 
has already fought its way to the Dnieper, sweeping all before it, 
and another winter offensive will bring it to the old, if not to the 
new, Soviet boundaries. Britain and the United States, too, are taking 
advantage of the change; Roosevelt and Churchill are waiting for 
the first sign of Hitler¹s downfall to thrust into France. In short, the 
German fascist war machine will soon fall apart, the problem of the 
anti-fascist war in Europe is on the eve of total solution, and the 
Soviet Union is the main force in annihilating fascism. As the world 
anti-fascist war has its pivot in Europe, once the problem there is 
solved, the fate of the two great world camps, the fascist and the 
anti-fascist camps, will be decided. The Japanese imperialists feel 
themselves cornered, and their policy, too, can only be to muster all 
possible strength for a desperate last-ditch struggle. In China, they 
This editorial was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Liberation 
Daily, Yenan. 
137

138 MAO TSE-TUNG 
will try to ³mop up² the Communists and entice the Kuomintang 
to capitulate. 
The Kuomintang has also sensed the change. Faced with this 
situation it feels both joy and fear. Joy, because it imagines that with 
the war in Europe over, Britain and the United States will be left 
free to fight Japan on its behalf, and that it will be able to return to 
Nanking without any effort. Fear, because with the downfall of all 
three fascist powers the world will enter a great and unprecedented 
age of liberation, and the Kuomintang¹s comprador-feudal fascist 
dictatorship will become a small island in a vast ocean of freedom 
and democracy; it fears that its own brand of fascism with its ³one 
party, one doctrine, one leader² will be buried beneath the waves. 
Originally the Kuomintang hoped to have the Soviet Union 
fighting it out with Hitler single-handed and to instigate the Japanese 
to attack the Soviet Union, so that the land of socialism would be 
destroyed or at least badly mauled; it also hoped that Britain and 
the United States would shift all their forces to the East and first 
smash Japan and then wipe out the Chinese Communist Party, before 
bothering about any second or third front in Europe. It was for this 
ulterior purpose that the Kuomintang first clamoured for a strategy 
of ³Asia before Europe² and then for ³equal attention to Europe 
and Asia². In August this year, towards the end of the Quebec conference, 
when Roosevelt and Churchill summoned T. V. Soong, the 
foreign minister of the Kuomintang government, to Quebec and spoke 
a few words to him, the Kuomintang started shouting that ³Roosevelt 
and Churchill are turning to the East², that ³the Europe before 
Asia¹ plan is changed², that ³Quebec is a conference of the three 
great powers, Britain, the United States and China², etc., and joyfully 
indulged in self-glorification. But this was the Kuomintang¹s last 
occasion to rejoice. Since then its mood has changed somewhat; ³Asia 
before Europe² and ³equal attention to Europe and Asia² have been 
consigned to the museum of history, and now the Kuomintang is 
probably cooking up new schemes. Perhaps the Eleventh Plenary 
Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and the 
Second Session of the Kuomintang-controlled People¹s Political Council 
mark the beginning of these new schemes. 
The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang CEC slanderously 
accused the Communist Party of ³sabotaging the War of 
Resistance and endangering the state², and at the same time declared 
itself in favour of a ³political solution² and of ³preparations for

139 A COMMENT ON THE KUOMINTANG CEC AND PPC SESSIONS 
constitutional government². Controlled and manipulated by its Kuomintang 
majority, the Second Session of the Third PPC passed 
resolutions against the Communist Party to roughly the same effect. 
In addition, the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang CEC 
³elected² Chiang Kai-shek president of the Kuomintang government 
in order to strengthen its dictatorial machine. 
What can the Kuomintang be planning to do now, following the 
Eleventh Plenary Session? There are only three possibilities: 
(1) capitulation to Japanese imperialism; 
(2) dragging along on the old road; and 
(3) a change in its political line. 
Serving the Japanese imperialists¹ purpose of ³hitting the Communists 
and courting the Kuomintang², the defeatists and capitulationists 
within the Kuomintang have all along advocated surrender. 
They have constantly endeavoured to unleash an anti-Communist civil 
war which, once started, would naturally make resistance to Japan 
impossible, leaving capitulation as the only alternative. The Kuomintang 
has concentrated 400,000 to 500,000 troops in northwestern China 
and is stealthily diverting still more forces there from other fronts. 
It is said that the generals are in good fettle and are proclaiming, 
³Taking Yenan is no problem.² This is how they have been talking 
since Mr. Chiang Kai-shek¹s speech at the Eleventh Plenary Session 
in which he described the Communist problem as ³a political 
one and should be solved politically² and since the Session¹s resolutions 
to roughly the same effect. Similar resolutions were adopted 
last year at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang CEC, 
and the ink was hardly dry before the generals were ordered to 
draw up military plans for liquidating the Border Region; in June 
and July this year forces were deployed in preparation for a blitz 
against the Border Region, and the scheme was temporarily shelved 
only because public opinion at home and abroad was against it. 
Now once again, no sooner have the resolutions of the Eleventh 
Plenary Session been put down in black and white than there are 
reports of the generals¹ braggadocio and of troop movements. ³Taking 
Yenan is no problem²  what does this signify? It signifies a 
decision to capitulate to Japanese imperialism. Not all the Kuomintang 
members who favour ³taking Yenan² are necessarily conscious 
and determined capitulationists. Some of them may think, ³We shall 
still resist the Japanese while fighting the Communists.² This is 
probably what many officers of the Whampoa clique1 are thinking.

140 MAO TSE-TUNG 
To these gentlemen we Communists would like to put the following 
questions. Have you forgotten the lessons of the ten years 
of civil war? Once another civil war starts, will the determined 
capitulationists allow you to continue the war against Japan? Will 
the Japanese and Wang Ching-wei allow you to continue the war 
against Japan? Are you really so strong that you can fight a civil 
war and a war against the foreign foe at the same time? You claim 
to have three million men, but your armies are so demoralized that 
people have compared them to two baskets of eggs on the ends of a 
carrying pole  one collision and they are finished. This is what has 
happened in all the campaigns in the Chungtiao Mountains, the 
Taihang Mountains, Chekiang and Kiangsi, western Hupeh and the 
Tapieh Mountains. The simple reason is that you have followed the 
fatal policy of being ³active against the Communists² and ³passive 
against the Japanese². A national enemy has penetrated deep into 
our country, and the more actively you fight the Communists and the 
more passively you resist the Japanese, the lower will be the morale 
of your troops. If you make such a poor show in fighting the foreign 
aggressor, can you expect your troops suddenly to become tough in 
fighting the Communists and the people? It is out of the question. 
Once you start civil war, you will have to give it your undivided 
attention and inevitably abandon all thought of ³simultaneous resistance²; 
in the end you will inevitably find yourselves signing a treaty 
of unconditional surrender to Japanese imperialism, with capitulation 
as the only policy left to you. Those of you in the Kuomintang who 
do not really wish to capitulate will inevitably end up as capitulationists 
if you take an active part in instigating or prosecuting civil 
war. This will surely happen if you lend yourselves to the manoeuvres 
of the capitulationist clique and use the resolutions of the Eleventh 
Plenary Session and the People¹s Political Council as an instrument 
for mobilizing public opinion and preparing for anti-Communist civil 
war. Even if you do not want to capitulate in the first place, you will 
end up by surrendering in the wake of the capitulationist clique if 
you lend yourselves to their manoeuvres and take a wrong step. That 
is the first possibility concerning the direction the Kuomintang may 
take after the Eleventh Plenary Session, and there is an extremely 
serious danger that it may materialize. From the standpoint of the 
capitulationist clique, talk about a ³political solution² and ³preparations 
for constitutional government² is the best means of camouflaging 
its preparations for civil war, i.e., for surrender; all Communists, all

141 A COMMENT ON THE KUOMINTANG CEC AND PPC SESSIONS 
patriotic members of the Kuomintang, all anti-Japanese parties, and 
all our fellow-countrymen who are opposed to Japan should be sharply 
on the alert against this extremely grave danger and should not be 
fooled by the camouflage. It must be recognized that the danger 
of civil war has never been so great as it is now after the Kuomintang¹s 
Eleventh Plenary Session. 
There is another direction in which these resolutions may lead, 
that of ³stalling for a while and starting the civil war later². This 
course, which differs somewhat from that of the capitulationist clique, 
may be taken by those people who still want to keep up the appearance 
of resistance to Japan while absolutely refusing to abandon anticommunism 
and dictatorial rule. They may move in this direction since 
they see that great changes in the international situation are inevitable 
and Japanese imperialism is doomed; that civil war would mean 
capitulation and the people throughout the country are for resistance 
and against civil war; that the Kuomintang is in a state of serious 
crisis, having alienated itself from the masses, lost popular support and 
become more isolated than ever; and that the United States, Britain 
and the Soviet Union are all opposed to the launching of civil war by 
the Chinese government. All this may force them to postpone their 
civil-war schemes and play for time with empty talk about a ³political 
solution² and ³preparations for constitutional government². These 
people are past masters in the tactics of deception and stalling. Even 
in their dreams they do not forget their desire to ³take Yenan² and 
³liquidate the Communist Party². On this point they are entirely at 
one with the capitulationist clique. Nevertheless they do wish to keep 
up the pretence of resistance to Japan, they do not wish the Kuomintang 
to forfeit its international standing, and they sometimes fear the 
censure of domestic and foreign public opinion; therefore they may 
stall behind the smokescreen of a ³political solution² and ³preparations 
for constitutional government² while waiting for more 
favourable conditions. They have no sincere desire for a ³political 
solution² or ³constitutional government², at least certainly not at the 
moment. Last year, about the time of the Tenth Plenary Session of 
the Kuomintang CEC, Comrade Lin Piao was sent to Chungking by 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party to confer with Mr. 
Chiang Kai-shek. He waited in Chungking for ten long months, but 
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and the Central Executive Committee of the 
Kuomintang had no desire to discuss a single concrete problem with 
him. In March this year, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek published his book

142 MAO TSE-TUNG 
China¹s Destiny in which he emphasizes his opposition to communism 
and liberal ideas, shifts the blame for the ten years of civil war on to 
the Communist Party, slanders the Communist Party, the Eighth 
Route Army and the New Fourth Army as ³warlords of a new type² 
and ³separatists of a new type², and implies that he will finish off 
the Communists within two years. On June 28 this year, Mr. Chiang 
Kai-shek permitted Chou En-lai, Lin Piao and other comrades to 
return to Yenan, but at that very moment he ordered his defence 
forces on the Yellow River to march on the Border Region, and he 
also ordered the local authorities throughout the country to seize the 
opportunity of the dissolution of the Third International to demand, 
in the name of so-called people¹s organizations, that the Communist 
Party of China be dissolved. In these circumstances, we Communists 
were obliged to call on the Kuomintang and the whole nation to avert 
civil war, and we were obliged to expose all the Kuomintang¹s sinister 
schemes and conspiracies which were sabotaging the War of Resistance 
and endangering the state. Our patience has been taxed to the limit, 
as the historical facts show. Ever since the fall of Wuhan, there has 
been no end to the anti-Communist battles, large or small, in northern 
and central China. It is now two years since the Pacific war broke 
out, and throughout this time the Kuomintang has been attacking the 
Communists in central and northern China, apart from the troops 
originally stationed there, it has dispatched the group armies under 
Wang Chung-lien and Li Hsien-chou to attack the Communists in 
Kiangsu and Shantung. Pang Ping-hsun¹s group army in the area of 
the Taihang Mountains is under orders to concentrate exclusively on 
the Communists; so are the Kuomintang troops in Anhwei and Hupeh. 
For a long time, we did not make even these facts public. The Kuomintang 
newspapers and periodicals have never for a moment stopped 
vilifying the Communist Party, but for a long time we did not say 
a word in reply. Without any justification, the Kuomintang disbanded 
the New Fourth Army which was heroically fighting Japan, wiped 
out over nine thousand men of its contingents in southern Anhwei, 
arrested Yeh Ting, killed Hsiang Ying2 and imprisoned hundreds of 
its cadres; although this was a monstrous betrayal of the people and 
the nation, we maintained our forbearance for the country¹s sake, 
simply lodging a protest and demanding redress. When Mr. Chiang 
Kai-shek met Comrade Chou En-lai, the representative of the Communist 
Party, at Lushan in June and July 1937, he promised that the 
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region would be designated by decree

143 A COMMENT ON THE KUOMINTANG CEC AND PPC SESSIONS 
as an administrative division under the direct jurisdiction of the 
Executive Yuan of the National Government and that its officials 
would receive formal appointments. Now Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has 
not only eaten his own words, he has gone so far as to encircle the 
Border Region with 400,000 to 500,000 men to enforce a military 
and economic blockade; he will not be happy with anything less than 
the destruction of the people of the Border Region as well as the rear 
headquarters of the Eighth Route Army. It is particularly notorious 
that promised supplies have been cut off from the Eighth Route Army 
and that the Communist Party is abused as the ³traitor party², the 
New Fourth Army as the ³rebel army², the Eighth Route Army as 
the ³traitor army², etc. In short, all the Kuomintang people who 
are behaving in this way see the Communist Party as the enemy. 
To the Kuomintang, the Communist Party is ten times, nay, a hundred 
times more hateful than the Japanese. The Kuomintang concentrates 
its hatred on the Communist Party and has little, if any, to spare for 
the Japanese. This resembles the behaviour of the Japanese fascists, 
who treat the Kuomintang and the Communist Party differently. 
Concentrating their hatred on the Chinese Communist Party, the 
Japanese fascists have become more and more gentle with the Kuomintang; 
of their two slogans, ³Oppose the Communists² and ³Annihilate 
the Kuomintang², only the first now remains. The newspapers 
and periodicals controlled by the Japanese and Wang Ching-wei no 
longer print such slogans as ³Down with the Kuomintang² and 
³Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek². Japan is bearing down on the Communist 
Party with 58 per cent of her forces in China and is just using 
42 per cent to keep watch on the Kuomintang; she has recently relaxed 
this watch and withdrawn many of her troops from Chekiang 
and Hupeh in order to make it easier to inveigle the Kuomintang 
into capitulation. The Japanese imperialists have never dared utter 
a single word to persuade the Communist Party to capitulate, but 
they have no hesitation in directing an endless stream of words to 
persuade the Kuomintang to do so. The Kuomintang is fierce only 
towards the Communist Party and the people, but it drops all its 
ferocity in the face of the Japanese. Not only has it changed from 
being a participant to being a mere spectator in the war as far as 
fighting is concerned, but even in words it dares not offer as much 
as a single sharp rebuff to the insults and blandishments of Japanese 
imperialism. The Japanese say, ³There is nothing wrong with the 
line of argument in Chiang Kai-shek¹s China¹s Destiny.² Has Mr.

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


DISTRIBUTION 
144 
Chiang or any member of his party ever rebutted this? No, they 
have not and dare not. How can the Japanese help despising the 
Kuomintang when they see that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang 
use ³military and governmental orders² and ³discipline² only 
against the Communists, and neither desire nor dare to use them 
against the twenty members of the Kuomintang Central Executive 
Committee and the fifty-eight Kuomintang generals who have deserted 
to the enemy? The people throughout the country and the friendly 
nations throughout the world have seen Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and 
the Kuomintang disbanding the New Fourth Army and attacking 
the Eighth Route Army, encircling the Border Region, maligning 
them with such labels as ³traitor party², ³traitor army², ³warlords 
of a new type², ³a new type of separatist regime², ³sabotaging the 
War of Resistance² and ³endangering the state², and constantly 
invoking ³military and governmental orders² and ³discipline²; they 
have never seen Mr. Chiang and the Kuomintang enforcing any 
military orders, government decrees or disciplinary measures against 
the twenty members of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee 
and the fifty-eight Kuomintang generals who went over to the enemy. 
Similarly, the resolutions recently passed at the Eleventh Plenary 
Session of the Kuomintang CEC and at the meeting of the People¹s 
Political Council are all directed against the Communist Party, while 
not a single one is directed against the many members of the Kuomintang 
CEC itself and the many army generals who have turned 
traitor and defected. What are the people throughout the country 
and the friendly nations throughout the world to think of the Kuomintang? 
As was to be expected, there was once again talk about 
a ³political solution² and ³preparations for constitutional government² 
at the Eleventh Plenary Session; well and good, we welcome 
such talk. But judging by the political line the Kuomintang has consistently 
followed all these years, we consider this talk to be just so 
many empty words designed to dupe the people, the real purpose 
being to gain time for preparing civil war so as to perpetuate its 
dictatorial rule over the people. 
Is there a third direction in which the current situation may 
develop? Yes, there is. It is what a number of Kuomintang members, 
all the people and we Communists are hoping for. What is this third 
course? A just and reasonable political settlement of the relations 
between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, a genuinely 
democratic and free constitutional government, the abolition of the

145 A COMMENT ON THE KUOMINTANG CEC AND PPC SESSIONS 
fascist dictatorship with its ³one party, one doctrine, one leader² and 
the convening during the War of Resistance of a national assembly 
genuinely elected by the people. We Communists have advocated this 
course from the very beginning. A number of Kuomintang members 
will also agree to it. For a long time we hoped that even Mr. Chiang 
Kai-shek and his own faction in the Kuomintang might pursue this 
course. But judging from what has happened in the last few years 
and what is happening now, there is nothing to show that Mr. Chiang 
and the majority of the Kuomintang personages in power are willing 
to do so. 
A number of conditions, international and domestic, are needed 
before this course can be realized. At the present time (with fascism 
in Europe on the eve of complete collapse) the international conditions 
are favourable to China¹s War of Resistance, but it is at this 
very moment that the capitulators are especially eager to instigate 
civil war so that they can capitulate, and that the Japanese and Wang 
Ching-wei, too, are particularly keen on civil war, so as to inveigle 
them into capitulation. Wang Ching-wei said (according to the Domei 
News Agency, October 1): ³Devoted brothers always remain brothers, 
and Chungking will certainly follow our road, the sooner the better, 
we hope.² What affection, confidence and eagerness! Thus in the 
present situation the best that can be expected from the Kuomintang 
is stalling, while the danger of a sudden deterioration is very grave 
indeed. The conditions necessary for the third course are not all present 
yet, and patriots of all parties and the people throughout China 
must make many-sided efforts to bring them into being. 
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek announced at the Eleventh Plenary Session: 
It should be stated clearly that the central authorities make 
no demands upon the Communist Party other than that it should 
give up its armed separatist regime and cease its surprise attacks 
on the National Army, which sabotage the War of Resistance; 
it is to be hoped that the Communist Party will carry out its 
declaration made in the 26th year of the Republic [1937] calling 
for united efforts to save the nation and will put into effect the 
four pledges given in that declaration. 
Mr. Chiang¹s talk of ³surprise attacks on the National Army, 
which sabotage the War of Resistance² ought to be applied to the 
Kuomintang itself, and it is a pity that he is so prejudiced and malicious 
as to slander the Communist Party in this way. Since the fall of Wuhan

146 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the Kuomintang has launched three anti-Communist onslaughts, in 
each of which, as the facts show, the Kuomintang troops sprang surprise 
attacks on the Communist forces. In the first campaign, from 
the winter of 1939 to the spring of 1940, the Kuomintang troops in 
their surprise attacks captured five county towns garrisoned by the 
Eighth Route Army in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, 
Chunhua, Hsunyi, Chengning, Ninghsien and Chenyuan, even employing 
aircraft in these operations. In northern China, Chu Huai-ping¹s 
troops were dispatched to the Taihang Mountain region for a surprise 
attack on the Eighth Route Army forces, which only fought 
back in self-defence. The second campaign was launched in January 
1941. Earlier, on October 19, 1940, Ho Ying-chin and Pai Chung-hsi 
had telegraphed a categorical order to Chu Teh, Peng Teh-huai, 
Yeh Ting and Hsiang Ying, commanding all units of the Eighth Route 
and New Fourth Armies south of the Yellow River to move north 
of the river within a month. We promised that our troops in southern 
Anhwei would move north; as for the others, while it was impossible 
for them to be shifted in the circumstances, we promised that they 
would move to the assigned positions after victory in the anti-Japanese 
war. Yet, before our 9,000 men in southern Anhwei began moving 
north on January 5 in compliance with the order, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek 
had already issued another order to ³catch them all in a dragnet². 
Between January 6 and 14, the Kuomintang troops in southern Anhwei 
actually did catch these New Fourth Army units in a dragnet. Moreover, 
on January 17, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the whole New 
Fourth Army to be disbanded and Yeh Ting to be court-martialled. 
The Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies have since been attacked 
wherever there are Kuomintang troops in the anti-Japanese base areas 
in central and northern China, and they have only fought back in 
self-defence. The third campaign began in March of this year and 
is still going on. The Kuomintang forces have continued their assaults 
on the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies in central and northern 
China. In addition, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has published his China¹s 
Destiny, which is a diatribe against communism and against the people. 
He has diverted many of his Yellow River defence forces for a lightning 
attack on the Border Region. He has instigated so-called people¹s 
organizations all over the country to demand the dissolution of the 
Communist Party. He has mobilized the Kuomintang majority in the 
People¹s Political Council to endorse Ho Ying-chin¹s military report 
vilifying the Eighth Route Army and to adopt anti-Communist res

147 A COMMENT ON THE KUOMINTANG CEC AND PPC SESSIONS 
olutions. He has thus turned the Council, which should be a symbol 
of anti-Japanese unity, into a private agency of the Kuomintang for 
manufacturing anti-Communist public opinion in preparation for civil 
war, with the result that Comrade Tung Pi-wu, the Communist member 
of the Council, had to walk out in protest. These three anti-Communist 
onslaughts were deliberately planned and launched by the Kuomintang. 
We may well ask, what are they if not actions which ³sabotage 
the War of Resistance²? 
On September 22 of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a declaration 
calling for united efforts to save the nation. In it we said: 
To strip the enemy of any pretext for his intrigues and to remove 
any misunderstanding among all well-intentioned doubters, 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China finds 
it necessary to proclaim its heartfelt devotion to the cause of 
national liberation. Therefore, it once again solemnly declares 
to the whole nation: (1) that Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s Three People¹s 
Principles being what China needs today, our Party is ready 
to fight for their complete realization; (2) that we shall discontinue 
the policies of insurrection to overthrow the Kuomintang 
regime and of forcible confiscation of the land of the landlords; 
(3) that we shall reorganize the present Red government as the 
democratic government of a special region in the hope that state 
power will be unified throughout the country; and (4) that the Red 
Army will change its name and designation, will be reorganized 
as part of the National Revolutionary Army and placed under 
the Military Council of the National Government, and will be 
ready for orders to march to the anti-Japanese front and do 
its duty. 
We have completely fulfilled these four pledges; neither Mr. Chiang 
Kai-shek nor anyone else in the Kuomintang can charge us with 
having defaulted on a single one of them. In the first place, the policies 
practised by the Communist Party in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region and in the anti-Japanese base areas behind the enemy lines 
are in keeping with Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s Three People¹s Principles, and 
not a single one runs counter to them. In the second place, as long as 
the Kuomintang does not capitulate to the national enemy, disrupt 
Kuomintang-Communist co-operation or launch civil war against the 
Communists, we will always keep our promise not to overthrow the

148 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Kuomintang regime or to confiscate the land of the landlords by force. 
We have kept this pledge in the past, are doing so now and will 
continue to do so in the future. That means that only when the Kuomintang 
capitulates to the enemy, disrupts co-operation and launches 
civil war will we be forced to cancel our pledge, for these are the only 
circumstances which would make it impossible for us to keep it. In the 
third place, the original Red government was reorganized in the very 
first year of the War of Resistance, and the !¹three thirds system² of 
democratic government has long been in operation, but to this day 
the Kuomintang has not fulfilled its promise to recognize the Shensi- 
Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and, what is more, it accuses us of 
³feudal separatism². Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and other members of the 
Kuomintang! You should know that what you call ³separatism²  
the state of affairs in which the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region 
and other anti-Japanese base areas are not recognized by the Kuomintang 
government  is not of our seeking but has been entirely forced 
on us by yourselves. What reason do you have for accusing us of 
³separatism² while you go back on your own words, refuse the 
recognition you pledged to the Border Region and refuse to acknowledge 
its democratic government? Day in day out we ask for recognition 
and you refuse  who then is responsible? What reason does 
Mr. Chiang have for railing against ³separatism² in his China¹s 
Destiny, without showing the slightest sense of his own responsibility 
in the matter, though he himself is Director-General of the Kuomintang 
and head of its government? Availing ourselves of the occasion 
of the Eleventh Plenary Session at which Mr. Chiang Kai-shek has 
again demanded that we fulfil our promise, we demand that he fulfil 
his promise to give legal recognition to the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia 
Border Region, where the Principle of Democracy has long been in 
practice, and to the anti-Japanese democratic base areas behind the 
enemy¹s lines as well. If you persist in your policy of non-recognition, 
it will mean that you want us to continue with ³separatism², and 
that, as in the past, the blame will fall entirely on you and not on us. 
In the fourth place, it is a long time since the Red Army changed its 
³name and designation², became ³reorganized as part of the National 
Revolutionary Army² and was ³placed under the Military Council 
of the National Government²; this pledge was fulfilled long ago. The 
only force directly under the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party and not under the Military Council of the National Government 
is the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army; the

149 A COMMENT ON THE KUOMINTANG CEC AND PPC SESSIONS 
reason is that it was proscribed as a ³rebel army² and ³disbanded² 
on January 17, 1941 by the Military Council in a counter-revolutionary 
order sabotaging the War of Resistance and endangering the state, 
and was, moreover, subjected to daily attacks by the Kuomintang 
troops. Yet this army has consistently fought the Japanese in central 
China and fulfilled the first three of the four pledges; furthermore, 
it is willing to come ³under the Military Council of the National 
Government² once again, and asks Mr. Chiang Kai-shek to repeal the 
order for its disbandment and restore its designation so as to enable 
it to fulfil the fourth pledge. 
The document concerning the Communist Party adopted at the 
Eleventh Plenary Session also stated: 
As for the other problems, they can all be raised at the national 
assembly for discussion and solution, since the present session has 
resolved that a national assembly should be convened and a 
constitution drawn up and promulgated within one year after the 
conclusion of the war. 
The ³other problems² here referred to are the abolition of the Kuomintang 
dictatorship, the abolition of the fascist secret service, the 
establishment of democratic rule throughout the country, the abolition 
of economic controls, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies harmful 
to the people, the application on a nation-wide scale of the agrarian 
policy of reducing rent and interest and of the economic policy of 
helping small and medium scale industries and improving the workers¹ 
livelihood. In its declaration of September 22, 1937 calling for united 
efforts to save the nation our Party stated: 
Democracy should be put into effect and a national assembly 
convened to frame and adopt a constitution and draw up a policy 
of national salvation. To enable the Chinese people to lead a happy 
and prosperous life, effective measures must first be taken to provide 
famine relief, ensure a stable livelihood, develop defence 
industries, deliver the people from suffering and improve their 
living conditions. 
Since this declaration was accepted in its entirety by Mr. Chiang 
Kai-shek in a statement on the very next day (September 23), he 
should not merely ask the Communist Party to keep the four pledges 
it set forth, he should also ask himself, the Kuomintang and the Kuomintang 
government to carry out the provisions we have quoted.

150 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is not only the Director-General of the Kuomintang, 
he has also become president of the Kuomintang government 
(nominally the National Government); he should therefore conscientiously 
carry out these provisions about democracy and the 
people¹s livelihood, honour the innumerable promises he himself has 
made to us Communists and to the people throughout the country, 
and should stop repudiating his promises and acting high-handedly, 
saying one thing and doing another. Together with the whole people, 
we Communists want deeds and not more empty, deceitful words. 
If deeds are forthcoming, we shall rejoice; empty words without deeds 
will not deceive the people for long. What we ask of Mr. Chiang 
Kai-shek and the Kuomintang is the following: Carry the War of 
Resistance through to the end, avert the danger of capitulation; 
continue co-operation, avert the crisis of civil war; recognize the democratic 
government in the Border Region and in the anti-Japanese base 
areas behind the enemy lines, reinstate the New Fourth Army, stop 
the anti-Communist campaign, withdraw the 400,000 to 500,000 troops 
now encircling the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region; stop using 
the People¹s Political Council as a private agency of the Kuomintang 
for stirring up anti-Communist opinion, lift the ban on freedom of 
speech, assembly and association, abolish the one-party dictatorship 
of the Kuomintang; reduce rent and interest, improve the living and 
working conditions of the workers, help the small and medium scale 
industries; abolish the secret service, put an end to fascist education 
and introduce democratic education. You yourselves have promised 
to do most of these things. If you fulfil these demands and promises, 
we assure you that we shall continue to fulfil our promises. We are 
ready to resume the talks between the two parties at any time, if 
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang are ready. 
In short, of the three possible directions which the Kuomintang 
may take, the first, capitulation and civil war, is the road of destruction 
for Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. The second, demagogic 
deception for the purpose of gaining time while clinging to fascist 
dictatorship and actively conducting secret preparations for civil war, 
likewise offers no salvation for Mr. Chiang and the Kuomintang. 
Only the third direction, the complete abandonment of the erroneous 
course of fascist dictatorship and civil war and the pursuit of the 
correct course of democracy and co-operation, can bring Mr. Chiang 
Kai-shek and the Kuomintang on to the road of salvation. However, 
Mr. Chiang and the Kuomintang have so far done nothing to convince

151 A COMMENT ON THE KUOMINTANG CEC AND PPC SESSIONS 
the people that they intend to move in the third direction; hence, 
the people throughout the country must remain on guard against the 
extremely grave danger of capitulation and civil war. 
Let all patriotic members of the Kuomintang unite and forbid 
the Kuomintang authorities to go in the first direction, prevent them 
from continuing in the second and demand that they take the third! 
Let all patriotic anti-Japanese parties and people unite and forbid 
the Kuomintang authorities to go in the first direction, prevent them 
from continuing in the second and demand that they take the third! 
An unparalleled change is imminent in the world. We hope that 
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and the members of the Kuomintang will conduct 
themselves well at this great turning point of our era. We hope that 
all patriotic parties and patriotic people will conduct themselves well 
at this great turning point of our era.

GET ORGANIZED! 
November 29, 1943
On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party I 
would like to say a few words at this reception it is giving for the 
labour heroes and heroines and other model workers in production 
elected from the villages, the factories, the armed forces, the government 
and other organizations and the schools in the Shensi-Kansu- 
Ningsia Border Region. What I want to say can be summed up in 
the words, ³Get organized!² This year the peasant masses and the 
people in the army, the government and other organizations, the 
schools and the factories of the Border Region have been conducting 
a production campaign in accordance with the resolutions of the 
meeting of senior cadres convened last winter by the Northwest Bureau 
of the Central Committee. Great achievements and advances have 
been scored in every field of production this year and the Border 
Region has taken on a new look. Facts have fully borne out the 
correctness of the policy adopted by the conference of senior cadres. 
The gist of this policy is to organize the masses, to mobilize and 
organize into a great army of labour all the available forces without 
exception  the people, the army, the government and other organizations 
and the schools  all men and women, young and old, who can 
contribute their labour power on a part-time or full-time basis. We 
have an army for fighting as well as an army for labour. For fighting 
we have the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies; but even they 
do a dual job, warfare and production. With these two kinds of armies, 
and with a fighting army skilled in these two tasks and in mass work, 
we can overcome our difficulties and defeat Japanese imperialism. 
If the achievements of our production campaign in the Border Region 
in recent years were not great or remarkable enough to prove this 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung made this speech at a reception in honour of the labour 
heroes of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
153

154 MAO TSE-TUNG 
conclusively, our achievements this year have really done so, as we 
have all seen with our own eyes. 
In all the armed units of the Border Region that have been 
allotted land this year, the soldiers have on the average cultivated 
eighteen mou per person; and they can produce or make practically 
everything  food (vegetables, meat and cooking oil), clothing (cottonpadded 
clothes, woollen knitwear and footwear), shelter (cavedwellings, 
houses and meeting halls), articles of daily use (tables, 
chairs, benches and stationery), and fuel (firewood, charcoal and coal). 
By using our own hands we have attained the objective of ³ample 
food and clothing². Every soldier needs to spend only three months 
of the year in production and can devote the remaining nine months 
to training and fighting. Our troops depend for their pay neither on 
the Kuomintang government, nor on the Border Region Government, 
nor on the people, but can fully provide for themselves. What a vitally 
important innovation for our cause of national liberation! During 
the last six and a half years of the War of Resistance, the anti-Japanese 
base areas have been subjected to the enemy¹s policy of ³burn all, 
kill all, loot all², the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region has been 
tightly blockaded by the Kuomintang and we were reduced to the 
direst straits financially and economically; if our troops had been 
able to do nothing except fight, we would never have solved our 
problems. Now our troops in the Border Region have learned to 
produce, and so have some of the troops at the front, while others 
are learning. If every man in our heroic and combat-worthy Eighth 
Route and New Fourth Armies becomes able not only to fight and 
do mass work but also to produce, we need fear no difficulty and 
shall be ³invincible under heaven²,1 to use the words of Mencius. 
Our organizations and schools have also taken a big step forward 
this year. Only a small part of their expenditure has come from 
the government, most of it being covered by their own production; 
they have grown 100 per cent of the vegetables they consume as 
compared with 50 per cent last year, considerably increased their 
consumption of meat by raising pigs and sheep, and established many 
workshops for making simple necessities. As the army, the organizations 
and the schools now meet their own material needs fully or 
for the most part, less is taken in taxation from the people, who 
can therefore enjoy more of the fruits of their labour. As soldiers 
and civilians are alike increasing production, all have ample food 
and clothing and are happy. In our factories, too, production has

155 GET ORGANIZED! 
been stepped up, secret agents have been combed out and productivity 
has risen greatly. Throughout the Border Region, labour heroes have 
come forward in great numbers in agriculture and industry, in the 
organizations and the schools, and also in the army; we can say that 
production in the Border Region has been set on the right path. All 
this comes from organizing the strength of the masses. 
To organize the strength of the masses is one policy. Is there a 
contrary policy? Yes, there is. It is one that lacks the mass viewpoint, 
fails to rely on the masses or organize them, and gives exclusive attention 
to organizing the small number of people working in the financial, 
supply or trading organizations, while paying no attention to organizing 
the masses in the villages, the army, the government and other 
organizations, the schools and factories; it treats economic work not 
as a broad movement or as an extensive front, but only as an expedient 
for meeting financial deficits. That is the other policy, the wrong policy. 
Such a policy formerly existed in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region, but after the correct guidance given over these years, and 
especially after the senior cadres¹ conference last year and the mass 
movement this year, the number of people who still think this way 
is probably small. In the base areas in northern and central China, 
where fighting is intense and the leading bodies have not given it 
enough attention, the production campaign of the masses has not yet 
become widespread. However, since the Central Committee¹s directive 
of October 12 this year, preparations are being made everywhere 
for a production campaign next year. Conditions at the front are 
more difficult than in the Border Region; not only is there heavy 
fighting, but natural disasters have occurred in some places. Nevertheless, 
we must mobilize the entire Party, the government and the 
army and the civilian population both to fight against the enemy and 
to engage in production, in order to support the war, to cope with 
the enemy¹s policy of ³burn all, kill all, loot all² and to provide disaster 
relief. With the experience already gained in the last few years in 
production at the front, and with the ideological, organizational and 
material preparations this winter, an extensive campaign can be and 
must be launched next year. In the front-line areas where fighting is 
going on, it is not yet possible to have ³ample food and clothing² but 
quite possible and, indeed, imperative to ³use our own hands and 
overcome difficulties². 
The co-operatives are now the most important form of mass 
organization in the economic field. Although it is unnecessary to insist

156 MAO TSE-TUNG 
on attaching the label co-operative to the productive activities of the 
masses in our army, our government and other organizations and our 
schools, these activities are of a co-operative nature, being carried on 
under centralized leadership to meet the material needs of various 
departments, units and individuals through mutual help and joint 
labour. They are co-operatives of a sort. 
Among the peasant masses a system of individual economy has 
prevailed for thousands of years, with each family or household forming 
a productive unit. This scattered, individual form of production 
is the economic foundation of feudal rule and keeps the peasants in 
perpetual poverty. The only way to change it is gradual collectivization, 
and the only way to bring about collectivization, according to 
Lenin, is through co-operatives.3 We have already organized many 
peasant co-operatives in the Border Region, but at present they are 
only of a rudimentary type and must go through several stages of 
development before they can become co-operatives of the Soviet type 
known as collective farms. Ours is a new-democratic economy, and 
our co-operatives are still organizations for collective labour based on 
an individual economy (on private property). Furthermore, they are 
of several types. One type is the organization of agricultural labour 
for mutual aid, such as the ³teams for the exchange of labour² and 
³teams for the exchange and hire of labour²;4 this kind of organization 
was known as the ³mutual-aid working group² or ³ploughing 
team²5 in the Red areas in Kiangsi and is now called the ³mutual-aid 
group² in some places at the front. So long as they are collective 
mutual-aid organizations which the people join voluntarily (compulsion 
must never be used), all of them are good, no matter how they 
are named, no matter whether they are each composed of a few, a 
few dozen or hundreds of people, or whether they are composed 
entirely or partly of people who can contribute full-time labour; no 
matter whether the members render each other mutual aid in terms 
of manpower, animal power or implements, or they live and eat 
together during the busy farming season; and no matter whether 
the organizations are temporary or permanent. These methods of 
collective mutual aid are the inventions of the masses themselves. In 
the past we summed up such experience among the masses in Kiangsi, 
and now we are summing it up in northern Shensi. In the Border 
Region mutual aid in labour has become much more systematic and 
better developed, after being encouraged by the meeting of senior cadres 
last year and put into practice all through the current year. Many

157 GET ORGANIZED! 
labour-exchange teams in the Border Region have done their ploughing, 
planting, weeding and reaping collectively, and the harvest this 
year is double that of last. Now that the masses have seen these 
substantial results, undoubtedly more and more people will adopt the 
practice next year. We do not expect to organize into co-operatives 
in one year all the hundreds of thousands of people in the Border 
Region who can contribute full-time or part-time labour, but this 
objective can be realized within a few years. All women, too, should 
be mobilized to do a certain amount of productive work. All loafers 
must be reformed into good citizens through participation in production. 
Such collective mutual-aid producers¹ co-operatives should be 
extensively and voluntarily organized in all the anti-Japanese base 
areas in northern and central China. 
Besides the collective mutual-aid co-operative for agricultural 
production, there are three other varieties: the multi-purpose cooperative 
like the Southern District Co-operative of Yenan, which 
combines the functions of producers¹, consumers¹, transport (salt 
transport) and credit co-operatives; the transport co-operative (salt 
transport team); and the handicraft co-operative. 
With these four kinds of co-operatives among the masses and the 
collective labour co-operatives in the army, the schools and the 
government and other organizations, we can organize all the forces 
of the people into a great army of labour. This is the only road to 
liberation for the people, the only road from poverty to prosperity 
and the only road to victory in the War of Resistance. Every Communist 
must learn to organize the labour of the masses. Communists 
with an intellectual background must also learn to do so; once they 
have set their minds on it, they can learn in six months or a year. 
They can help the masses to organize production and to sum up 
experience. When our comrades have learned, among other skills, to 
organize the labour of the masses  to help the peasants draw up 
their household production plans, to set up labour-exchange teams, 
salt transport teams and multi-purpose co-operatives, to organize 
production in the army, the schools and the government and other 
organizations, to organize production in the factories, develop emulation 
in production, encourage and reward labour heroes, and arrange 
production exhibitions  when our comrades have learned to bring 
the creative power and initiative of the masses into play, we shall 
certainly be able to drive out the Japanese imperialists and, together 
with the whole people, build up a new China.

158 MAO TSE-TUNG 
We Communists must be able to integrate ourselves with the 
masses in all things. If our Party members spend their whole lives 
sitting indoors and never go out to face the world and brave the 
storm, what good will they be to the Chinese people? None at all, 
and we do not need such people as Party members. We Communists 
ought to face the world and brave the storm, the great world of mass 
struggle and the mighty storm of mass struggle. ³Three cobblers with 
their wits combined equal Chukeh Liang the master mind.²6 In other 
words, the masses have great creative power. In fact there are thousands 
upon thousands of Chukeh Liangs among the Chinese people; 
every village, every town has its own. We should go to the masses 
and learn from them, synthesize their experience into better, articulated 
principles and methods, then do propaganda among the 
masses, and call upon them to put these principles and methods into 
practice so as to solve their problems and help them achieve liberation 
and happiness. If our comrades doing local work are isolated from 
the masses, fail to understand their feelings and to help them organize 
their production and improve their livelihood, and if they confine 
themselves to collecting ³public grain for national salvation² without 
realizing that 10 per cent of their energy is quite enough for this 
purpose provided they first devote 90 per cent to helping the masses 
solve the problem of ³private grain for the people¹s own salvation², 
then these comrades are contaminated with the Kuomintang style of 
work and covered with the dust of bureaucracy. The Kuomintang 
only demands things from the people and gives them nothing in 
return. If a member of our Party acts in this way, his style of work 
is that of the Kuomintang, and his face, caked with the dust of 
bureaucracy, needs a good wash in a basin of hot water. In my opinion, 
this bureaucratic style is to be found in local work in all our anti- 
Japanese base areas, and there are comrades who are isolated from 
the masses because they lack the mass viewpoint. We must firmly do 
away with this style of work before we can have close ties with 
the masses. 
In addition, a kind of warlord style is to be found in our army 
work, a style also characteristic of the Kuomintang whose army is 
divorced from the masses. Our troops must observe the correct 
principles that govern relations between the army and the people, 
between the army and the government, between the army and the 
Party, between officers and men, and between military work and 
political work, and relations among the cadres, and must never com

159 GET ORGANIZED! 
mit the errors of warlordism. Officers must cherish their men and 
must not be indifferent to their well-being or resort to corporal 
punishment; the army must cherish the people and never encroach 
upon their interests; the army must respect the government and the 
Party and never ³assert independence². Our Eighth Route and New 
Fourth Armies are the armed forces of the people; they have always 
been very good, and are indeed the best in the country. But it is true 
that in recent years errors of warlordism of a certain kind have arisen, 
and some comrades in the army have become arrogant and high-handed 
in their behaviour towards the soldiers, the people, the government 
and the Party, always blaming the comrades doing local work but 
never themselves, always seeing their own achievements but never 
their own shortcomings, and always welcoming flattery but never 
criticism. Such phenomena are to be found, for example, in the Shensi- 
Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. The tendency has been basically 
overcome as a result of the conference of senior cadres and the meeting 
of military and political cadres last year and of the campaigns to 
³support the government and cherish the people² and ³support the 
army² during the Spring Festival7 this year, but there is still a residue 
which we must make further efforts to eradicate. These faults are 
also to be found in the base areas in northern and central China, 
and the Party organizations and the army there must endeavour to 
eradicate them. 
Whether it is the tendency towards bureaucracy in local work or 
towards warlordism in army work, the fault is of the same nature, 
namely, isolation from the masses. The overwhelming majority of 
our comrades are good comrades. Those who have this fault can 
correct it once they have been criticized and their mistakes pointed 
out. But self-criticism is imperative and wrong tendencies must be 
squarely faced and conscientiously corrected. If anyone fails to 
criticize the tendency towards bureaucracy in local work or towards 
warlordism in army work, it means that he wants to retain the Kuomintang 
style and keep the dust of bureaucracy or warlordism on 
his otherwise clean face, and he is not a good Communist. If these 
two tendencies are eliminated, all our work, including, of course, the 
production campaign, will proceed smoothly. 
Our Border Region has taken on a totally different look because 
great results have been achieved here in production, whether among 
the peasant masses, or in the government and other organizations, 
the schools, the army or in the factories, and the relations between

160 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the army and the people have greatly improved. All this indicates 
that our comrades have a stronger mass viewpoint and have made 
great progress in becoming one with the masses. Nevertheless, we 
must not be complacent but continue our self-criticism and strive for 
further progress. We must strive for further progress in production, 
too. As our faces are apt to get dirty, we must wash them every day; 
as the floor is apt to gather dust, we must sweep it every day. Even 
though the tendencies towards bureaucracy in local work and warlordism 
in army work have been basically overcome, these bad 
tendencies may arise again. We are surrounded by the serried forces 
of Japanese imperialism and Chinese reaction, and we live in the 
midst of the undisciplined petty bourgeoisie, and hence great gusts of 
dirt of bureaucracy and warlordism blow in our faces daily. Therefore, 
we must not become complacent over every success. We should check 
our complacency and constantly criticize our shortcomings, just as we 
should wash our faces or sweep the floor every day to remove the 
dirt and keep them clean. 
Labour heroes and model workers in production! You are leaders 
of the people, you have been very successful in your work, and I hope 
you, too, will not grow complacent. I hope that when you get back 
to the counties in the sub-regions of Kuanchung, Lungtung, Sanpien, 
Suiteh and Yenan,8 when you get back to your organizations, schools, 
army units or factories, you will lead the people, lead the masses 
and work still better, and first of all get the masses organized on a 
voluntary basis into co-operatives, get them even better organized 
and in even greater numbers. I hope that, when you go back, you will 
do this work and propagate it, so that by next year¹s conference of 
labour heroes we shall have achieved still greater results.

in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. Labour-exchange is a means by which 
the peasants adjust labour power among themselves. Man-workdays were exchanged 
for man-workdays, ox-workdays for ox-workdays, man-workdays for ox-workdays, 
etc. Peasants who joined labour-exchange teams contributed their labour power or 
animal power to cultivate the land of each member-family collectively and in 
rotation. In settling accounts, the workday was taken as the unit of exchange; those 
who contributed more man-workdays or animal-workdays were paid for the difference 
by those who contributed less. ³Teams for the exchange and hire of labour² 
were usually formed by peasants with insufficient land. Besides exchanging work 
among themselves for mutual aid, their members also hired themselves out collectively 
to families which were short of labour power. 
5 Mutual-aid working groups and ploughing teams, based on individual farming, 
were formed by peasants in the Red areas to facilitate production through a 
better organization of labour power. On the principle of voluntary participation and 
mutual benefit, the members did an equal amount of work for each other, or if one 
could not give another as much help as he received he made up the difference in cash. 
Apart from helping each other, the teams gave preferential treatment to the families 
of Red Army soldiers and worked for bereaved old folk without any pay except 
for meals during the work. As these measures of mutual aid were of great help to 
production and were carried out on a reasonable basis they won the warm support 
of the masses.

OUR STUDY AND 
THE CURRENT SITUATION 
April 12, 1944
I 
Since last winter, the senior cadres of our Party have been studying 
the question of the two lines that existed in the history of the Party. This 
has very greatly raised the political level of these numerous senior cadres. 
In the course of the study, comrades have brought up many questions, 
and the Political Bureau of the Central Committee has reached conclusions 
on some of the important ones. They are as follows: 
1. On the question of what attitude to adopt in studying our 
historical experience. The Central Committee holds that we should 
enable the cadres to become perfectly clear ideologically on the 
questions which arose in the history of the Party and that at the same 
time we should adopt a lenient policy in arriving at decisions about 
comrades who formerly committed errors, so that on the one hand 
the cadres should thoroughly understand the historical experience of 
our Party and avoid repeating past errors, and on the other hand all 
comrades can be united for our common endeavour. In the history 
of our Party there were great struggles against the erroneous lines of 
Chen Tu-hsiu1 and of Li-san, and they were absolutely necessary. 
But there were defects in the methods employed. For one thing, the 
cadres were not brought to a full ideological understanding of the 
From 1942 to 1944 the central organ and senior cadres of the Communist Party 
of China held discussions on the history of the Party, especially of the period from 
the beginning of 1931 to the end of 1934. These discussions greatly helped in bringing 
about ideological unity in the Party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. The enlarged 
meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee at Tsunyi, Kweichow, in 
January 1935, had corrected the erroneous ³Left² line pursued from early 1931 to late 
1934, changed the composition of the central leading organ, established the leadership 
headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung and set the Party line on the correct 
163

164 MAO TSE-TUNG 
causes of these errors, the circumstances in which they were committed 
and the detailed ways and means of correcting them, so that 
errors of a similar nature came to be repeated; and for another, too 
much stress was placed on the responsibility of individuals, so that we 
failed to unite as many people as we could have done for our common 
endeavour. We should take warning from these two defects. This time, 
in dealing with questions of Party history we should lay the stress not on 
the responsibility of certain individual comrades but on the analysis of 
the circumstances in which the errors were committed, on the content 
of the errors and on their social, historical and ideological roots, and 
this should be done in the spirit of ³learning from past mistakes to 
avoid future ones² and ³curing the sickness to save the patient², in 
order to achieve the twofold objective of clarity in ideology and unity 
among comrades. The adoption of a careful attitude in handling cases 
of individual comrades, neither glossing things over nor doing harm 
to comrades, is a sign that our Party is vigorous and flourishing. 
2. Treat all questions analytically; do not negate everything. 
The question concerning the line of the central leadership during the 
period from the Fourth Plenary Session2 to the Tsunyi Meeting,3 for 
example, should be analysed from two aspects. It should be pointed 
out on the one hand that the political tactics, the military tactics 
and the cadres policy which the central leading body adopted during 
that period were wrong in their main aspects, but on the other hand 
that on such fundamental issues as opposing Chiang Kai-shek and 
carrying on the Agrarian Revolution and the struggle of the Red 
Army there was no dispute between ourselves and the comrades who 
committed errors. And even the tactical side needs to be analysed. 
On the land question, for instance, their error consisted in the ultra- 
Left policy of allotting no land to the landlords and poor land to 
the rich peasants, but these comrades were at one with us on con- 
Marxist-Leninist track; nevertheless, many Party cadres had not yet reached a 
thorough understanding of the character of the erroneous lines of the past. In 
order to raise the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of Party cadres still higher, in 
1942-43 the Political Bureau held several discussions on the history of the Party, 
and then led the senior cadres of the whole Party in holding similar discussions 
during 1943-44. These discussions were an important preparation for the Seventh 
National Congress of the Party in 1945, enabling it to attain an ideological and 
political unity without precedent in the history of the Communist Party of China. 
³Our Study and the Current Situation² was a speech made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung 
at a meeting of senior cadres in Yenan on April 12, 1944 on the subject of these 
discussions.

165 OUR STUDY AND THE CURRENT SITUATION 
fiscating the land of the landlords for distribution among peasants 
who had little or no land. Concrete analysis of concrete conditions, 
Lenin said, is ³the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul 
of Marxism².4 Lacking an analytical approach, many of our comrades 
do not want to go deeply into complex matters, to analyse and study 
them over and over again, but like to draw simple conclusions which 
are either absolutely affirmative or absolutely negative. The fact that 
our newspapers are lacking in analytical articles and that the habit 
of analysis is not yet fully cultivated in the Party shows that there 
are such shortcomings. From now on we should remedy this state 
of affairs. 
3. On the discussion of the documents of the Sixth National 
Congress of the Party. It should be stated that the line of the Sixth 
National Congress was basically correct, since that Congress defined 
the character of the present revolution as bourgeois-democratic, 
defined the situation at that time as an interval between two revolutionary 
high tides, repudiated opportunism and putschism and 
promulgated the Ten-Point Programme.5 All this was correct. The 
Congress also had its defects. For instance, among its other shortcomings 
or mistakes, it failed to point out the very protracted nature 
of the Chinese revolution and the very great importance of rural base 
areas in the revolution. Nonetheless, the Sixth National Congress 
played a progressive role in the history of our Party. 
4. On the question of whether the provisional central leadership 
that was formed in Shanghai in 1931 and the Fifth Plenary Session6 
which it subsequently convened were legal or not. The Central 
Committee holds that both were legal, but it should be stated that 
the procedures for the election were inadequate and that this case 
should be taken as a historical lesson. 
5. On the question of factions in the history of the Party. It 
should be stated that as a result of the series of changes since the 
Tsunyi Meeting the factions which formerly existed and played an 
unwholesome role in the history of our Party no longer exist. In our 
present study of the two lines within the Party, it is absolutely necessary 
to point out that these factions did exist and did play an unwholesome 
role. But it would be wrong to think that factions with the same 
erroneous political programmes and organizational forms still exist 
in the Party, after all the changes brought about by so many inner- 
Party struggles  the Tsunyi Meeting of January 1935, the Sixth 
Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in October 1938, the

166 MAO TSE-TUNG 
enlarged session of the Political Bureau in September 1941,7 the Partywide 
rectification movement in 1942 and the campaign begun in the 
winter of 1943 for the study of the past struggles between the two 
lines within the Party. The old factions are gone. What is left is only 
the remnants of dogmatist and empiricist ideology, which can be 
overcome by continuing and intensifying our rectification movement. 
But what still exists in our Party to a serious extent, and almost everywhere, 
is a more or less blind ³mountain-stronghold² mentality.8 
For instance, there is a lack of mutual understanding, mutual respect 
and unity among comrades of different units, which arises from differences 
in their background of struggle, differences in the areas in 
which they work (as between one base area and another and as 
between the Japanese-occupied areas, the Kuomintang areas and the 
revolutionary base areas) and differences in their departments of work 
(as between one army unit and another and as between one kind 
of work and another); this phenomenon seems quite commonplace 
but in fact it seriously obstructs the unity of the Party and the growth 
of its fighting capacity. The social and historical roots of the mountainstronghold 
mentality lie in the fact that the Chinese petty bourgeoisie 
is particularly large and that for a long period our rural base areas 
have been cut off from one another by the enemy, while the subjective 
cause is the insufficiency of inner-Party education. The important task 
now confronting us is to point out these causes, to persuade our comrades 
to get rid of their blindness and raise the level of their political 
awareness, to break down the ideological barriers that separate comrades 
and to promote mutual understanding and respect, so as to 
bring about unity throughout the Party. 
A clear understanding of these questions by the whole Party will 
not only assure the success of our present course of study within the 
Party, but will also assure the victory of the Chinese revolution.

The present situation has two characteristics: one is that the antifascist 
front is growing stronger and the fascist front is declining, 
and the second is that within the anti-fascist front the people¹s forces 
are growing stronger and the anti-popular forces are declining. The 
first characteristic is quite obvious and can readily be seen. Hitler

167 OUR STUDY AND THE CURRENT SITUATION 
will be defeated before long, and the Japanese aggressors, too, are 
heading for defeat. The second characteristic is not so obvious and 
cannot readily be seen, but it is daily becoming more manifest in 
Europe, in Britain and the United States and in China. 
The growth of the people¹s forces in China has to be explained 
with our Party as the centre of the picture. 
The growth of our Party during the War of Resistance Against 
Japan can be divided into three stages. The first stage was from 
1937 to 1940. In 1937 and 1938, the first two years of this stage, the 
Japanese militarists took the Kuomintang seriously and the Communist 
Party lightly; therefore they threw their main forces against 
the Kuomintang front, and, in their policy towards the Kuomintang, 
military attack was primary and political blandishments to bring about 
capitulation were supplementary; they did not take the Communistled 
anti-Japanese base areas seriously, believing that these amounted 
to only a handful of Communists engaged in guerrilla actions. But 
after occupying Wuhan in October 1938, the Japanese imperialists 
began to change their policy and to take the Communist Party seriously 
and the Kuomintang lightly. In their policy towards the Kuomintang, 
political blandishments to bring about capitulation became primary and 
military attack supplementary, while at the same time they gradually 
shifted their main forces to deal with the Communists. For the 
Japanese imperialists now felt it was no longer the Kuomintang, but 
the Communist Party, that was to be feared. In 1937 and 1938, the 
Kuomintang put rather more effort into the War of Resistance, its 
relations with our Party were comparatively good and it permitted 
rather more freedom, although imposing many restrictions on the 
people¹s anti-Japanese movement. After the fall of Wuhan, however, 
because of its defeats in the war and its increasing hostility towards 
the Communist Party, the Kuomintang gradually became more reactionary, 
more active against the Communists and more passive in 
the war against Japan. In 1937, as a result of the setbacks in the civil 
war period, the Communist Party had only about 40,000 organized 
members and an army of 30,000 men; hence it was taken lightly by 
the Japanese militarists. But by 1940 the Party¹s membership had risen 
to 800,000, our army had grown to nearly 500,000, and the population 
of the base areas, including those paying grain tax only to us and 
those paying it both to us and to the Japanese and puppets,9 totalled 
about 100,000,000. In the course of several years our Party had opened 
up such an extensive theatre of war, namely, the Liberated Areas,

168 MAO TSE-TUNG 
that for no less than five and a half years we were able to prevent 
any strategic offensive by the main forces of the Japanese invaders 
against the Kuomintang front, draw these forces around ourselves, 
extricate the Kuomintang from the crisis in its theatre of war and 
maintain the protracted War of Resistance. But during that stage 
some comrades in our Party committed an error; they underestimated 
Japanese imperialism (and so did not see the protracted and ruthless 
nature of the war, maintained that mobile warfare with large formations 
should be primary and belittled guerrilla warfare), placed reliance 
on the Kuomintang, and failed to pursue an independent policy 
soberly (hence their capitulationism towards the Kuomintang and 
their vacillation in applying the policy of boldly and freely arousing 
the masses to establish anti-Japanese democratic base areas behind 
the enemy lines and greatly expanding the armed forces led by our 
Party). Meanwhile our Party had recruited large numbers of new 
members who were still inexperienced, and all the base areas in the 
enemy¹s rear were newly established and not yet consolidated. During 
this stage, a kind of conceit appeared within the Party because of 
the favourable development of the general situation and the growth 
of our Party and armed forces, and many members became swelledheaded. 
During this stage, however, we overcame the Right deviation 
in the Party and carried out an independent policy; we not only hit 
Japanese imperialism hard, created base areas and expanded the 
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies, but also repulsed the first 
large-scale anti-Communist onslaught by the Kuomintang. 
The years 1941 and 1942 formed the second stage. In order to prepare 
and prosecute the war against Britain and the United States, 
the Japanese imperialists more actively pursued the policy to which 
they had switched after the fall of Wuhan, the policy of concentrating 
on the Communist Party and not on the Kuomintang. They massed 
a still larger part of their main forces around all the Communist-led 
base areas, conducted one ³mopping-up² operation after another, and 
executed the ruthless policy of ³burn all, kill all, loot all², concentrating 
their attacks on our Party. As a result, in the two years 1941-42, our 
Party was placed in an extremely difficult position. During this stage 
its base areas shrank in size, the population fell to under 50,000,000, 
the Eighth Route Army was reduced to 300,000, the loss of cadre 
was very great, and our finances and economy were very heavily 
strained. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang, finding its hands free, moved 
against our Party in a thousand and one ways, unleashed its second

169 OUR STUDY AND THE CURRENT SITUATION 
large-scale anti-Communist onslaught and attacked us in co-ordination 
with the Japanese imperialists. But this difficult position served to 
educate us Communists and we learned many things. We learned 
how to combat the enemy¹s ³mopping-up² operations, his policy of 
³nibbling² our territory, his ³tighten public security² campaign,10 his 
policy of ³burn all, kill all, loot all² and his policy of extorting political 
recantations. We learned or began to learn how to carry out the ³three 
thirds system² in the state organs of the united front, how to carry 
out the land policy, the rectification movement to correct our style 
of study, style in Party relations and style of writing, the policy of 
better troops and simpler administration, the policy of unified leadership, 
the movement for supporting the government and cherishing 
the people, and the development of production. And we overcame 
many shortcomings, including the conceit of many people that had 
arisen during the first stage. Although our losses in the second stage 
were very heavy, we held our ground; we repulsed the offensives of 
the Japanese invaders on the one hand and the second large-scale anti- 
Communist onslaught of the Kuomintang on the other. The Kuomintang¹s 
attacks on the Communist Party and the struggles we had to 
wage in self-defence gave rise to a kind of ultra-Left deviation in the 
Party, one example being the belief that Kuomintang-Communist cooperation 
would soon break down, with the result that excessive attacks 
were made on the landlords and unity with public figures outside the 
Party was neglected. But we overcame this deviation also. In the 
struggle to counter the friction created by the Kuomintang we affirmed 
the principle of waging struggles ³on just grounds, to our advantage, 
and with restraint², and in united front work we pointed out the 
necessity of ³unity, struggle, unity through struggle². Thus we maintained 
the Anti-Japanese National United Front throughout the 
country as well as in the base areas. 
The third stage extends from 1943 to the present. Our various 
policies have become more effective and, in particular, the rectification 
movement and the development of production have yielded 
results of a fundamental nature, thereby making our Party invincible 
both ideologically and materially. Moreover, last year we learned, or 
began to learn, how to carry out our policy on the examination of the 
histories of cadres and our policy on combating secret agents. It is 
in these circumstances that our base areas have again expanded, that 
the population has risen to over 80,000,000, including those paying 
the grain tax only to us and those paying it both to us and to the Japanese

170 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and puppets, that our army has grown to 470,000 and our people¹s 
militia to 2,270,000, and that our Party membership has reached 
900,000 and more. 
In 1943 the Japanese militarists made no appreciable change in 
their policy towards China and continued to direct their main attacks 
at the Communist Party. For more than three years, from 1941 to the 
present, over 60 per cent of the Japanese troops in China have been 
pressing hard on the anti-Japanese base areas led by our Party. During 
these years the several hundred thousand Kuomintang troops who 
were left behind the enemy lines have been unable to withstand the 
blows of Japanese imperialism; about half surrendered, about half 
were wiped out, and only a small number survived and withdrew. 
Those Kuomintang troops who surrendered have turned and attacked 
our Party, which has consequently had to resist over 90 per cent 
of the puppet troops. The Kuomintang has only had to resist less than 
40 per cent of the Japanese forces and less than 10 per cent of the 
puppet troops. For fully five and a half years since the fall of Wuhan 
in October 1938, the Japanese militarists have not launched a single 
strategic offensive on the Kuomintang front; there have been only 
a few relatively big operations (in Chekiang-Kiangsi, Changsha 
western Hupeh, southern Honan and Changteh), and even these were 
mere raids, while they concentrated their main attention on the anti- 
Japanese base areas led by our Party. In this situation, the Kuomintang 
has pursued the policy of ³retreating into the mountains² and ³watching 
others fight², simply staving off blows when the enemy advanced 
and looking on with folded arms when he withdrew. In 1943 the 
Kuomintang became even more reactionary in its domestic policy 
and made its third large-scale anti-Communist onslaught, which we 
again repulsed. 
From 1943 to the spring of this year, the Japanese aggressors have 
been steadily losing ground in the Pacific theatre, the United States 
has been intensifying its counter-offensive, and now, in the West, 
Hitler is tottering under the heavy blows of the Soviet Red Army. 
In an effort to avert their doom, the Japanese imperialists have conceived 
the idea of forcing the Peiping-Hankow and Hankow-Canton 
Railways open for through traffic and, since they have not yet 
succeeded in their policy of inducing the Kuomintang in Chungking 
to capitulate, they have found it necessary to deal it another blow; 
hence their plan for a large-scale offensive on the Kuomintang front 
this year. The Honan campaign11 has been going on for over a month.

171 OUR STUDY AND THE CURRENT SITUATION 
The enemy forces there amount to only a few divisions, yet several 
hundred thousand Kuomintang troops have collapsed without a battle, 
and only the troops of miscellaneous brands have been able to put 
up some sort of fight. In Tang En-po¹s command, utter disorder prevails, 
with the officers estranged from their men and the troops from 
the people, and more than two-thirds of his total forces have been lost. 
Likewise, the divisions which Hu Tsung-nan dispatched to Honan 
collapsed at their first encounter with the enemy. This is wholly the 
result of the reactionary policies which the Kuomintang has rigorously 
enforced for the past few years. During the five and a half years since 
the fall of Wuhan, the theatre of war of the Liberated Areas led by 
the Communist Party has borne the brunt of resisting the main forces 
of the Japanese and puppets; and although there may be some change 
in the future, it can only be temporary because the Kuomintang, 
rendered utterly degenerate by its reactionary policy of passive resistance 
to Japan and active opposition to the Communists, is bound 
to suffer serious reverses. When that happens, our Party¹s task in 
fighting the enemy and the puppets will become heavier still. What 
the Kuomintang has gained from looking on with folded arms for 
five and a half years is the loss of its fighting capacity. What the 
Communist Party has gained from fighting and struggling hard for 
five and a half years is the strengthening of its fighting capacity. This 
is what will decide China¹s destiny. 
Comrades can see for themselves that in the seven years since 
July 1937 the people¹s democratic forces under the leadership of our 
Party have gone through three phases  a rise, a decline and a new 
rise. We have beaten back the ferocious attacks of the Japanese 
invaders, established extensive revolutionary base areas, greatly 
expanded the Party and the army, repulsed three large-scale anti- 
Communist onslaughts by the Kuomintang and overcome the erroneous 
Right and ³Left² ideologies in the Party; and the whole Party has 
gained much valuable experience. This sums up our work over the 
past seven years. 
Our present task is to prepare ourselves for a still greater responsibility. 
We must prepare to drive the Japanese invaders out of 
China, whatever the circumstances. To enable our Party to shoulder 
this responsibility, we must further expand and consolidate our Party, 
our army and base areas, pay attention to work in the big cities and 
along the main lines of communication and raise the work in the 
cities to a position of equal importance with that in the base areas.

172 MAO TSE-TUNG 
As for out work in the base areas, during the first stage these 
areas were greatly expanded but not consolidated, and so in the 
second stage they contracted as soon as they came under the heavy 
blows of the enemy. In the second stage all the anti-Japanese base 
areas led by our Party went through a hard tempering process and 
improved greatly as compared with the first stage; the cadres and 
Party members considerably advanced their ideological and political 
level, and learned many things they did not know before. But it takes 
time to clarify thinking and to study policy, and we have still much 
to learn. Our Party is not yet sufficiently strong, not yet sufficiently 
united or consolidated, and so cannot yet take on greater responsibility 
than we now carry. From now on the problem is further to expand 
and consolidate our Party, our army and base areas in the continued 
prosecution of the War of Resistance; this is the first indispensable 
item in our ideological and material preparation for the gigantic work 
of the future. Without this preparation, we shall not be able to drive 
out the Japanese invaders and liberate the whole of China. 
Our work in the big cities and along the main lines of communication 
has always been very inadequate. If now we do not strive to 
rally around our Party the tens of millions of the toiling masses and 
other people oppressed by the Japanese imperialists in the big cities 
and along the main lines of communication, and do not prepare armed 
mass insurrections, our army and rural base areas will face all sorts 
of difficulties for lack of co-ordination with the cities. For more than 
ten years we have been in the countryside and have had to encourage 
people to know the countryside well and to build the rural base areas. 
During these ten years and more the task of preparing insurrections 
in the cities, as decided by the Party¹s Sixth National Congress, was 
not and could not have been carried out. But now it is different, and 
the resolution of the Sixth National Congress will be carried out after 
the Seventh National Congress. This Congress will probably be held 
soon and will discuss the problems of strengthening our work in the 
cities and winning nation-wide victory. 
The industrial conference of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region, now in session, is of great significance. In 1937 the number of 
factory workers in the Border Region was only 700, it increased to 
7,000 by 1942 and is now 12,000. These figures are not to be treated 
lightly. While we are in the base areas, we must learn how to administer 
the industry, commerce and communications of big cities, 
or otherwise we shall not know what to do when the time comes.

173 OUR STUDY AND THE CURRENT SITUATION 
Thus the second indispensable item in our ideological and material 
preparation for the future is to organize for armed insurrections in 
the big cities and along the main lines of communication and to learn 
how to administer industry and commerce. Without this preparation 
too, we shall not be able to drive out the Japanese invaders and liberate 
the whole of China. 
III 
In order to win new victories we must call on our Party cadres 
to get rid of the baggage and start up the machinery. ³To get rid of the 
baggage² means to free our minds of many encumbrances. Many things 
may become baggage, may become encumbrances, if we cling to them 
blindly and uncritically. Let us take some illustrations. Having made 
mistakes, you may feel that, come what may, you are saddled with 
them and so become dispirited; if you have not made mistakes, you 
may feel that you are free from error and so become conceited. Lack 
of achievement in work may breed pessimism and depression, while 
achievement may breed pride and arrogance. A comrade with a short 
record of struggle may shirk responsibility on this account, while a 
veteran may become opinionated because of his long record of struggle. 
Worker and peasant comrades, because of pride in their class origin, 
may look down upon intellectuals, while intellectuals, because they 
have a certain amount of knowledge, may look down upon workers 
and peasants. Any specialized skill may be capitalized on and so 
may lead to arrogance and contempt of others. Even one¹s age may 
become ground for conceit. The young, because they are bright and 
capable, may look down upon the old; and the old, because they are 
rich in experience, may look down upon the young. All such things 
become encumbrances or baggage if there is no critical awareness. 
An important reason why some comrades are very lofty, isolating 
themselves from the masses and making repeated mistakes, is that 
they carry such baggage. Thus, a prerequisite for maintaining close 
links with the masses and making fewer mistakes is to examine one¹s 
baggage, to get rid of it and so emancipate the mind. There have 
been several occasions in the history of our Party when great conceit 
manifested itself and we suffered in consequence. The first was in 
the early half of 1927. The Northern Expeditionary Army had reached 
Wuhan, and some comrades became so proud and overweening as to

174 MAO TSE-TUNG 
forget that the Kuomintang was about to assault us. The result was 
the error of the Chen Tu-hsiu line, which brought defeat to the revolution. 
The second occasion was in 1930. Taking advantage of Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s large-scale war against Feng Yu-hsiang and Yen Hsi-shan,12 
the Red Army won a number of battles, and again some comrades 
became proud and overweening. The result was the error of the 
Li-san line, again causing some losses to the revolutionary forces. 
The third occasion was in 1931. The Red Army had smashed the 
Kuomintang¹s third ³encirclement and suppression² campaign and, 
immediately afterwards, faced with the Japanese invasion, the people 
throughout the country started the stormy and heroic anti-Japanese 
movement, and again some comrades became proud and overweening. 
The result was an even more serious error in the political line, which 
cost us about go per cent of the revolutionary forces that we had built 
up with so much toil. The fourth occasion was in 1938. The War of 
Resistance had begun and the united front had been established; and 
once again some comrades became proud and overweening. As a 
result they committed an error somewhat similar to the Chen Tu-hsiu 
line. This time the revolutionary work suffered serious damage in 
those places where the effects of these comrades¹ erroneous ideas were 
more especially pronounced. Comrades throughout the Party should 
take warning from these instances of pride and error. Recently we 
have reprinted Kuo Mo-jo¹s essay on Li Tzu-cheng,13 so that comrades 
may also take warning from this story and not repeat the error of 
becoming conceited at the moment of success. 
³To start up the machinery² means to make good use of the 
organ of thought. Although some people carry no baggage and have 
the virtue of close contact with the masses, they fail to accomplish 
anything because they do not know how to think searchingly or are 
unwilling to use their brains to think much and think hard. Others 
refuse to use their brains because they are carrying baggage which 
cramps their intellect. Lenin and Stalin often advised people to use 
their brains, and we should give the same advice. This mechanism, 
the brain, has the special function of thinking. Mencius said, ³The 
office of the mind is to think.²14 He defined the function of the brain 
correctly. We should always use our brains and think everything over 
carefully. A common saying goes, ³Knit the brows and you will hit 
upon a stratagem.² In other words, much thinking yields wisdom. In 
order to get rid of the practice of acting blindly which is so common 
in our Party, we must encourage our comrades to think, to learn the

175 OUR STUDY AND THE CURRENT SITUATION 
method of analysis and to cultivate the habit of analysis. There is all 
too little of this habit in our Party. If we get rid of our baggage and 
start up the machinery, if we march with light packs and know how 
to think hard, then we are sure to triumph. 
NOTES 
1 Chen Tu-hsiu was originally a professor at Peking University and became 
famous as an editor of New Youth. He was one of the founders of the Communist 
Party of China. Because of his reputation at the time of the May 4th Movement and 
owing to the Party¹s immaturity in its initial period, he became General Secretary of 
the Party. In the last period of the revolution of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in the 
Party represented by Chen Tu-hsiu developed into a line of capitulationism. Comrade 
Mao Tse-tung has observed that the capitulationists at that time ³voluntarily gave up 
the Party¹s leadership of the peasant masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle 
bourgeoisie, and in particular gave up the Party¹s leadership of the armed forces, thus 
causing the defeat of the revolution² (³The Present Situation and Our Tasks², 
Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Eng. ed., FLP, Peking, 1961, Vol. IV, p. 171). 
After the defeat of 1927 Chen Tu-hsiu and a handful of other capitulationists lost 
faith in the future of the revolution and became liquidationists. They took the 
reactionary Trotskyist stand and together with the Trotskyites formed a small anti- 
Party group. Consequently Chen Tu-hsiu was expelled from the Party in November 
1929. He died in 1942. 
2 The Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China was held in January 1931. 
3 The Tsunyi Meeting was the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau called 
by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at Tsunyi, Kweichow 
Province, in January 1935. 
4 See V. I. Lenin, ³¹Communism¹², in which Lenin, criticizing the Hungarian 
Communist Bela Kun, said that he ³gives up the most essential thing in Marxism, 
the living soul of Marxism, the concrete analysis of concrete conditions² (Collected 
Works, Russ. ed., Moscow, 1950, Vol. XXXI, p. 143). 
5 The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in July 
8 adopted the following Ten-Point Programme: (1) overthrow imperialist rule; 
(2) confiscate foreign capitalist enterprises and banks; (3) unify China and recognize 
the right of the nationalities to self-determination; (6) overthrow the Kuomintang 
warlord government; (5) establish a government of councils of workers, peasants 
and soldiers; (6) institute the eight-hour day, increase wages, and establish unemployment 
relief and social insurance; (7) confiscate the land of all landlords and 
distribute the land among the peasants; (8) improve the living conditions of the 
soldiers, give land and jobs to ex-soldiers; (9) abolish all exorbitant taxes and 
miscellaneous levies and adopt a consolidated progressive tax; and (10) unite with 
the world proletariat, unite with the Soviet Union. 
6 The Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China was held in January 1934.

176 MAO TSE-TUNG 
7 This session of the Political Bureau in September 1941 reviewed the question 
of the political line in the past history of the Party, especially during the Second 
Revolutionary Civil War. 
8 The ³mountain-stronghold² mentality was a tendency to form cliques and 
arose mainly out of the circumstances of the protracted guerrilla war in which rural 
revolutionary bases were scattered and cut off from each other. Most of these bases 
were first established in mountain regions. Each tended to regard itself as a compact 
unit, like a single mountain stronghold, so this wrong tendency became known as 
mountain-stronghold mentality. 
9 In the relatively stable parts of the base areas the people paid the regular 
grain tax only to the anti-Japanese democratic government. But in the outlying 
parts of the base areas and the guerrilla zones, which were constantly harassed by 
the enemy, the people were often forced to pay another grain levy to the enemy¹s 
puppet government. 
10 In March 1941 the Japanese invaders and Chinese traitors in northern China 
proclaimed a ³campaign for tightening public security², which included raiding the 
people¹s houses, establishing the neighbourhood guarantee system, making house-tohouse 
check-ups and organizing puppet troops, all for the purpose of suppressing 
the anti-Japanese forces. 
11 In March 1944 the Japanese invaders launched their campaign in Honan 
Province with a force of 50,000 to 60,000 men. The 400,000 Kuomintang troops under 
Chiang Ting-wen, Tang En-po and Hu Tsung-nan melted away before the Japanese 
invaders. Thirty-eight counties, including Chengchow and Loyang, fell to the enemy 
one after another. Tang En-po lost 200,000 men. 
12 This large-scale war between the warlords, with Chiang Kai-shek on the 
one side and Feng Yu-hsiang and Yen Hsi-shan on the other, was fought along the 
Lunghai and Tientsin-Pukow Railways. It lasted six months, from May to October. 
Casualties on both sides reached 300,000. 
13 Kuo Mo-jo wrote the essay ³The Tercentenary of the 1644 Uprising² in 1944 
to commemorate the victory of the peasant uprising led by Li Tzu-cheng in the last 
years of the Ming Dynasty. He explained that the uprising met with defeat in 1645 
because, after the entry of the peasant forces into Peking in 1644, some of their 
leaders were corrupted by luxurious living, and factional strife arose. The essay first 
appeared in New China Daily in Chungking and was later published as a pamphlet 
in Yenan and elsewhere in the Liberated Areas.

APPENDIX:   RESOLUTION  ON  CERTAIN
QUESTIONS  IN  THE  HISTORY
OF  OUR  PARTY

Adopted  on  April 20, 1945
by  the  Enlarged  Seventh  Plenary  Session  of
the  Sixth  Central  Committee  of
the  Communist  Party  of  China

I

	Ever since its birth in 1921, the Communist Party of China has
made the integration of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with
the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution the guiding principle
in all its work, and Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s theory and practice
of the Chinese revolution represent this integration.  With the founding
of our Party a new stage of the Chinese revolution was immediately
unfolded, the stage of the new-democratic revolution, as pointed
out by Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  Throughout the twenty-four years of
struggle for New Democracy (from 1921 to 1945), throughout the three
historical periods  the First Great Revolution, the Agrarian Revolu-
tion and the War of Resistance Against Japan  our Party has con-
sistently led the broad masses of the Chinese people in extremely
arduous and bitter revolutionary struggles against their enemies, im-
perialism and feudalism, and has gained great successes and rich
experience.  In the course of its struggle the Party has produced its
own leader, Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  Representing the Chinese pro-
letariat and the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Tse-tung has creatively
applied the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism, the acme of human
wisdom, to China, a large semi-feudal and semi-colonial country in
which the peasantry constitutes the bulk of the masses and the im-
mediate task is to fight against imperialism and feudalism, a country
with a vast area and a huge population, where the situation is
extremely complicated and the struggle extremely hard, and he has
177

178 MAO TSE-TUNG 
brilliantly developed the theories of Lenin and Stalin on the colonial
and semi-colonial question as well as Stalin¹s theory concerning the
Chinese revolution.  It is only because the Party has firmly adhered
to the correct Marxist-Leninist line and waged a victorious struggle
against all erroneous ideas opposed to this line that it has scored great
achievements in these three periods, has arrived at today¹s un-
precedented ideological, political and organizational solidarity and
unity, has developed into the powerful revolutionary force of today,
having over 1,200,000 members and leading China¹s Liberated Areas
with their population of nearly 100,000,000 and an army of nearly
1,000,000, and has become the centre of gravity for the whole nation
in the War of Resistance Against Japan and in the cause of liberation.


II

	In the first period of China¹s new-democratic revolution, from
1921 to 1927, and especially from 1924 to 1927, the great anti-imperialist
and anti-feudal revolution of the Chinese people, correctly guided
by the Communist International and influenced, impelled forward
and organized by the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party, advanced rapidly and won great victories.  In this great revolu-
tion, the whole membership of the Communist Party of China carried
out tremendous revolutionary work, developed the labour, youth and
peasant movements throughout the country, pushed forward and
assisted in the reorganization of the Kuomintang and the formation
of the National Revolutionary Army, provided the political backbone
of the Eastern Campaign1 and the Northern Expedition, led the great
nation-wide struggle against imperialism and feudalism, and so wrote
a most glorious chapter in the history of the Chinese revolution.
Nevertheless, this revolution ended in defeat because in 1927 the
clique of reactionaries in the Kuomintang, which was then our ally,
betrayed the revolution; because the combined forces of the imperialists
and the reactionary Kuomintang clique were then too strong; and in
particular because the Rightist ideology in our Party, represented by
Chen Tu-hsiu, developed into a line of capitulation during the conclud-
ing period of this revolution (for about six months) and dominated the
Party¹s leading body, which refused to carry out the many wise
directives of the Communist International and of Comrade Stalin and

179 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
refused to accept the correct views of Comrade Mao Tse-tung and
other comrades, with the result that, when the Kuomintang betrayed
the revolution and sprang a surprise attack on the people, the Party
and the people were unable to organize effective resistance.
	In the ten years from the defeat of the revolution in 1927 to the
outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, it was the
Communist Party of China, and the Communist Party of China alone,
which continued in unity to hold aloft the great banner of anti-
imperialism and anti-feudalism under the counter-revolutionary reign
of extreme terror and which led the broad masses of workers, peasants,
soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals and other revolutionaries in great
political, military and ideological struggles.  During these struggles
the Communist Party of China created the Red Army, established the
government of Councils of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, set up
revolutionary bases, distributed land to impoverished peasants and
resisted both the attacks of the reactionary Kuomintang government
and, after September 18, 1931, the aggression of Japanese imperialism.
As a result, the Chinese people achieved great successes in their new-
democratic cause of national and social liberation.  Similarly, the
whole Party fought in unity against the counter-revolutionary activities
of the Trotskyist Chen Tu-hsiu clique and of Lo Chang-lung,2 Chang
Kuo-tao3 and others who tried to split the Party and who betrayed it;
thus the unity of the Party on the basis of the general principles of
Marxism-Leninism was ensured.  Over these ten years, this general
policy of the Party and the heroic struggles to carry it out were entirely
correct and necessary.  Countless Party members, countless numbers
of the people and many revolutionaries outside the Party carried on
fiery revolutionary struggles on the various fronts, dauntlessly fighting
and sacrificing themselves, indomitably stepping into the breach as
others fell; by their spirit and deeds they have won immortality in
our nation¹s history.  Without all this, the War of Resistance Against
Japan could not have been effected; or having been effected, it could
not have been sustained and carried through to victory because it
would not have had as its backbone a Communist Party which had
accumulated a rich experience of people¹s war.  This is beyond all doubt.
	We rejoice especially in the fact that in those ten years our Party,
with Comrade Mao Tse-tung as its representative, made very great
advances in creatively applying to Chinese conditions the revolu-
tionary theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.  At last, towards
the end of the Agrarian Revolutionary War, our Party definitely

180 MAO TSE-TUNG 
established the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung in the central
leading body and throughout the Party.  This was the greatest achieve-
ment of the Communist Party of China in that period and it is the
surest guarantee of the liberation of the Chinese people.
	We must point out, however, that besides its great achievements
in those ten years, our Party at certain times committed a number of
errors.  The gravest of all was the ³Left² error in the political, military
and organizational lines from the time of the Fourth Plenary Session
of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party in January 1931 to the
enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
in January 1935 (the Tsunyi Meeting).  That error caused serious losses
to our Party and to the Chinese revolution.
	In order to learn the historic lessons of the Chinese revolution,
³to learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones and to cure the
sickness to save the patient², to make ³the overturning of the chariot
in front a warning for the chariot behind² and in order, on the
basis of a common Marxist-Leninist ideology, to unite the whole
Party like one harmonious family, like solid steel, to fight for total
victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and for the complete
liberation of the Chinese people, this Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session
of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
considers it useful and necessary to set forth formal conclusions on
certain questions of Party history during those ten years, and partic-
ularly on the line of the central leadership from the Fourth Plenary
Session to the Tsunyi Meeting.


III

	After the defeat of the revolution in 1927, both ³Left² and Right
deviations occurred in our Party.
	The handful of capitulationists of the period of the First Great
Revolution, with Chen Tu-hsiu as their representative, became pessi-
mistic about the future of the revolution and gradually turned into
liquidationists.  They took the reactionary Trotskyist stand, holding
that after the 1927 revolution the Chinese bourgeoisie was already
victorious over imperialism and the feudal forces, that its rule over
the people was being stabilized, and that Chinese society was already
one in which capitalism was dominant and would develop peacefully.

181 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
Therefore, they arbitrarily asserted that the bourgeois-democratic
revolution in China had been completed and that the Chinese pro-
letariat must wait until the future to make the ³socialist revolution²
and could engage for the time being only in a so-called legal move-
ment centring on the slogan ³For a National Assembly², thus liqui-
dating the revolutionary movement.  Therefore, they opposed all the
revolutionary struggles waged by the Party and slandered the Red
Army movement as a ³movement of roving rebels².  They not only
refused to accept the Party¹s advice and abandon their opportunist,
liquidationist anti-Party viewpoint, but even joined with the re-
actionary Trotskyites4 and formed an anti-Party faction; as a result,
they had to be expelled from the Party and later degenerated into
counter-revolutionaries.
	On the other hand, petty-bourgeois revolutionary impetuosity,
which was aggravated by hatred of the Kuomintang¹s policy of
massacre and by indignation at Chen Tu-hsiu¹s capitulationism, was
also reflected in the Party and led to a rapid growth of ³Left² senti-
ment.  This ³Left² sentiment first appeared at the emergency meeting
of the Party¹s Central Committee on August 7, 1927.  In the history
of the Party the August 7th Meeting made a positive contribution.
At a critical moment in the Chinese revolution, it resolutely corrected
and ended the capitulationism of Chen Tu-hsiu, decided upon a
general policy of Agrarian Revolution and armed resistance to the
Kuomintang reactionaries¹ massacres and called on the Party and
the masses to continue the revolutionary fight.  All this was correct
and constituted the main aspect of the meeting.  But in combating
Right errors the meeting paved the way for ³Left² errors.  Politically,
it failed to realize that either appropriate counter-attacks or necessary
tactical retreats had to be organized at that time, according to the
different conditions in the different localities, in order to preserve
revolutionary positions and muster the revolutionary forces in a
planned way.  Instead, it tolerated and fostered tendencies towards
adventurism and commandism (especially the forcing of workers to
strike).  Organizationally, the meeting initiated excessive and sectarian
inner-Party struggles, unduly or improperly stressed the importance
of the leading cadres¹ being exclusively of working-class origin and
brought about a rather serious state of ultra-democracy in the Party.
After the August 7th Meeting this ³Left² sentiment continued to grow
until, at the enlarged meeting of the central leading body in Novem-
ber 1927, it took shape in a ³Left² line of putschism (i.e., adventurism)

182 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and for the first time brought the ³Left² line into a dominant posi-
tion in the central leading body of the Party.  The putschists then
maintained that the Chinese revolution was by nature a so-called
permanent revolution (they confused the democratic with the social-
ist revolution) and that the Chinese revolution was in a situation of
so-called permanent upsurge (they denied the defeat of the 1927
revolution).  Consequently, they not only failed to organize an orderly
retreat but, on the contrary, disregarding the enemy¹s strength and
the state of the masses after the defeat of the revolution, they
ordered handfuls of members and followers of the Party to stage
local insurrections all over the country which had not the slightest
hope of success.  Along with this political adventurism, there also
developed a sectarian organizational policy of attacking comrades.
However, as this wrong line from its outset evoked correct criticism
and objection on the part of Comrade Mao Tse-tung and many com-
rades working in the White areas, and as it caused many losses in
practical work, it had ceased to be applied in many places by the be-
ginning of 1928 and by April of the same year (less than six months
from its beginning) it was virtually terminated in practical work
throughout the country.
	The line of the Sixth National Congress of the Party, held in July
1928, was basically correct.  The Congress rightly affirmed that Chinese
society was semi-colonial and semi-feudal, pointed out that none
of the fundamental contradictions giving rise to the contemporary
Chinese revolution had yet been resolved, and therefore defined the
Chinese revolution at the present stage as still a bourgeois-democratic
revolution and proclaimed a Ten-Point Programme5 for that demo-
cratic revolution.  The Congress correctly pointed out that the current
political situation was an interval between two revolutionary high
tides, that the development of the revolution was uneven and that
the general task of the Party at the time was not to take the offensive
or organize insurrections but to win over the masses.  It waged a two
front struggle, repudiating both Right Chen Tu-hsiuism and ³Left²
putschism, and in particular indicated that the most dangerous tend-
ency in the Party consisted in putschism, military adventurism and
commandism which alienate the masses.  All this was absolutely
necessary.  On the other hand, the Sixth Congress also had its short-
comings and mistakes.  It lacked correct estimates and policies con-
cerning the dual character of the intermediate classes and the internal
contradictions among the reactionary forces; it also lacked the

183 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
necessary understanding of the Party¹s need for an orderly tactical
retreat after the defeat of the Great Revolution, of the importance
of rural base areas and of the protracted nature of the democratic
revolution.  Although these shortcomings and mistakes prevented the
thorough eradication of the ³Left² ideas existing after the August 7th
Meeting, and although they were made more extreme and were greatly
magnified by the subsequent ³Left² ideas, nevertheless they cannot
eclipse the correctness of the Congress in its main aspect.  For some
time after the Congress, the Party¹s work was fruitful.  During that
time, Comrade Mao Tse-tung not only, in practice, developed the
correct aspect of the line of the Sixth Congress and correctly solved
many problems which the Congress had either not solved or had
solved incorrectly, but also, in theory, provided a fuller and more
concrete, scientific Marxist-Leninist basis for the orientation of the
Chinese revolution.  Under his guidance and influence, the Red Army
movement gradually developed into an important political factor in
the country.  In the White areas, too, Party organizations and Party
work to some extent revived.
	But during the second half of 1929 and the first half of 1930 certain
³Left² ideas and policies that still existed in the Party once more
gained some ground.  From this basis they developed into the second
³Left² line when events turned in favour of the revolution.  Excited
by the domestic situation after the outbreak of war in May 1930 be-
tween Chiang Kai-shek on the one side and Feng Yu-hsiang and Yen
Hsi-shan on the other, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee,
led by Comrade Li Li-san, adopted on June 11 the ³Left² resolution,
³The New Revolutionary High Tide and Winning Victory First in
One or More Provinces², whereupon the ³Left² line came to dominate
the central leading body for the second time.  This wrong line (the
Li Li-san line) arose for a number of reasons.  It arose because Li
Li-san and other comrades failed to recognize that the revolution
required adequate preparation by the building up of its own organ-
izational strength, but held that ³the masses want only big actions,
not small ones², and therefore believed that the incessant wars
among the warlords at the time, together with the initial unfolding
of the Red Army movement and the initial revival of our work in the
White areas, already provided conditions for ³big actions² (armed
insurrections) throughout the country.  It arose because they failed
to recognize the uneven development of the Chinese revolution but
held that the revolutionary crisis was growing uniformly in all parts

184 MAO TSE-TUNG 
of the country, that preparations should be made everywhere for im-
mediate insurrections and that the key cities in particular should take
the lead and become centres of a nation-wide revolutionary upsurge;
and they slandered as ³utterly erroneous . . . localism and conservatism
characteristic of peasant mentality² Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s idea
that for a long time we should employ our main strength to create
rural base areas, use the rural areas to encircle the cities and use these
bases to advance a high tide of nation-wide revolution.  It arose because
they failed to recognize the uneven development of world revolution
but held that the general outbreak of the Chinese revolution would
inevitably lead to a general outbreak of world revolution, without
which the Chinese revolution could not possibly be successful.  And
it arose because they failed to recognize the protracted character of
China¹s bourgeois-democratic revolution but held that the beginning
of victory in one or more provinces would mark the beginning of the
transition to socialist revolution, and so they formulated a number
of untimely and ³Left² policies.  With these wrong views, the leaders
of the Li Li-san line drew up an adventurist plan for organizing armed
insurrections in the key cities throughout the country and for con-
centrating the whole of the Red Army to attack these cities.  Then
they merged the various leading bodies of the Party, the Youth League
and the trade unions into action committees at corresponding levels
for preparing armed insurrections, and thus brought all day-to-day
work to a standstill.  In the course of formulating and executing these
wrong decisions, Comrade Li Li-san rejected the correct criticisms
and suggestions of many comrades and stressed the fight within the
Party against the so-called ³Right deviation², under the slogan of
which he wrongly attacked those cadres who disagreed with his views,
thereby deepening inner-Party sectarianism.  Thus, the Li Li-san line
assumed a more fully developed form than did the first ³Left² line.
	However, the domination of the Li Li-san line in the Party was
also short-lived (lasting less than four months).  Since the Party and
the revolutionary forces suffered losses wherever this line was put
into practice, broad sections of cadres and Party members demanded
that it should be corrected.  Comrade Mao Tse-tung in particular never
agreed with the Li Li-san line, and indeed most patiently corrected
the ³Left² mistakes of the First Front Army of the Red Army;6 conse-
quently, instead of suffering losses in this period, the Red Army in
the revolutionary base in Kiangsi actually grew stronger by utilizing
the favourable situation created by the war between Chiang Kai-shek

185 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
and Feng Yu-hsiang and Yen Hsi-shan, and it successfully smashed
the enemy¹s first campaign of ³encirclement and suppression² in late
1930 and early 1931.  With a few exceptions, the Red Army in the other
revolutionary base areas achieved similar results.  In the White areas
also, there were many comrades engaged in practical work who opposed
the Li Li-san line through the organizational channels of the Party.
	The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee held
in September 1930 and the subsequent central leadership played a
positive role in putting an end to the application of the Li Li-san line.
Although the documents of this session showed a conciliatory and
compromising spirit with regard to the Li Li-san line (for instance, in
denying that it was a wrong line and in saying that it was only ³wrong
tactically²) and although organizationally this session continued the
error of sectarianism, it nevertheless corrected the ultra-Left appraisal
of the situation of the Chinese revolution, dropped the plan for organ-
izing a general nation-wide insurrection and concentrating the whole
of the Red Army to attack key cities, and restored the independent
organizations and the day-to-day work of the Party, the Youth League
and the trade unions; it thereby terminated the most characteristic
errors of the Li Li-san line.  At the Third Plenary Session, Comrade
Li Li-san himself admitted the mistakes that had been pointed out and
then relinquished his leading position in the Political Bureau.  The
central leadership after the Third Plenary Session, going a step
further, declared in its supplementary resolution of November 1930
and in Circular No. 96 of December that the line of Li Li-san and
other comrades was wrong and that the conciliatory attitude of the
plenary session was wrong too.  Of course, both the Third Plenary
Session and the subsequent central leadership failed to examine the
ideological essence of the Li Li-san line thoroughly and to correct it,
and so certain ³Left² ideas and policies that had existed within the
Party ever since the August 7th Meeting in 1927, and especially since
1929, strongly persisted at this session and afterwards.  However, since
both the Third Plenary Session and the subsequent central leadership
did take the positive measures described above to end the Li Li-san
line, all Party comrades should have made further efforts, on the
basis of these measures, to carry through the struggle against the
³Left² errors.
	But at this time, a number of Party comrades who were inex-
perienced in practical revolutionary struggle and guilty of ³Left
dogmatist errors came forward, with Comrade Chen Shao-yu (Wang

186 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Ming) at their head, and fought against the central leadership under
the banners of ³Against the Li Li-san Line² and ³Against the Line
of Conciliation², taking a sectarian stand even more violent than
that of the Li Li-san line.  Their fight was not designed to help the
central leadership liquidate the ideological essence of the Li Li-san
line and those ³Left² ideas and policies which had existed in the Party
since the August 7th Meeting in 1927, and particularly since 1929, and
had never been thoroughly dealt with.  They put forward what was
actually a new political programme in Comrade Chen Shao-yu¹s
pamphlet published at that time, The Two Lines or The Struggle for
the Further Bolshevization of the Communist Party of China, a
programme that continued, revived or developed the Li Li-san line
and other ³Left² ideas and policies in a new guise.  Thus, there was
a further growth of ³Left² ideas in the Party which took the form of
a new ³Left² line.
	Although this new ³Left² line under Comrade Chen Shao-yu¹s
leadership criticized the ³Left² errors of the Li Li-san line and the
error of conciliation on the part of the Third Plenary Session, its
distinctive feature was that it mainly criticized the Li Li-san line as
³Rightist², that it accused the Third Plenary Session of ³doing nothing
to expose and attack the consistently Right opportunist theory and
practice of the Li Li-san line² and that it blamed Circular No.  96 for
failure to see that ³the Right deviation is still the main danger in the
Party at present².  On the question of the nature of Chinese society
and class relations, the new ³Left² line exaggerated the relative
weight of capitalism in China¹s economy, exaggerated the significance
of the struggle against the bourgeoisie and the rich peasants and the
significance of the ³elements of socialist revolution² at the present
stage of the Chinese revolution, and denied the existence of the inter-
mediate camp and of third parties and groups.  On the question of
the revolutionary situation and the tasks of the Party, the new ³Left²
line continued to stress that there was a ³revolutionary high tide²
throughout the country and that the Party should have a ³line of taking
the offensive² on a national scale, and it held that an ³immediate
revolutionary situation² would soon occur in one or more major
provinces containing key cities.  From a ³Left² viewpoint it slander-
ously asserted that in China there was as yet no ³genuine² Red Army
and no ³genuine² government of Councils of Workers, Peasants and
Soldiers and asserted with special emphasis that the main danger in
the Party then consisted of ³Right opportunism², ³opportunism in

187 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
practical work² and ³the rich peasant line².  Organizationally, the
exponents of this new ³Left² line violated discipline, refused the
work assigned them by the Party, committed the error of joining with
a number of other comrades in factional activities against the central
leadership, wrongly called upon the Party membership to set up a
provisional central leading body and demanded that ³fighting cadres²
who ³actively support and pursue² their ³Left² line should be used
to ³reform and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels²; they
thereby created a serious crisis in the Party.  Hence, generally speak-
ing, the new ³Left² line was more determined, more ³theoretical²,
more domineering and more fully articulated in its ³Leftism² than the
Li Li-san line, even though it did not call for organizing insurrections
in the key cities and, for a time, did not call for concentrating the Red
Army to attack those cities.
	In January 1931 the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central
Committee of the Party was convened under circumstances in which
pressure was being applied from all directions by the ³Left² dog-
matist and sectarian elements headed by Comrade Chen Shao-yu and
in which some comrades in the central leading body who had com-
mitted empiricist errors were compromising with these elements and
supporting them.  The convening of this session played no positive or
constructive role; the outcome was the acceptance of the new ³Left²
line, its triumph in the central leading body and the beginning of the
domination of a ³Left² line in the Party for the third time during the
period of the Agrarian Revolutionary War.  The Fourth Plenary Session
immediately put into effect two interrelated and erroneous tenets in
the programme of the new ³Left² line: the fight against the alleged
³Right deviation² as the ³main danger in the Party at present², and
the ³reform and strengthening of the leading bodies at all levels².
Ostensibly it still carried the banner of opposition to the Li Li-san
line and to the ³line of conciliation², but in essence its political pro-
gramme was chiefly ³against the Right deviation².  In its resolutions,
the Fourth Plenary Session did not analyse the current political situa-
tion or lay down concrete political tasks for the Party and merely
opposed the so-called ³Right deviation² and ³opportunism in practical
work² in a general way, but in fact it approved Comrade Chen
Shao-yu¹s pamphlet, The Two Lines or The Struggle for the Further
Bolshevization of the Communist Party of China, the pamphlet which
represented the ³Left² ideas in the Party and was taken by people
then, and for another ten years or more, to have played a ³correct

188 MAO TSE-TUNG 
programmatic role², although, as can be seen from the above analysis,
it was basically a completely wrong, ³Left² opportunist general pro-
gramme ³against the Right deviation².  Under this programme the
Fourth Plenary Session and the subsequent central leadership pro-
moted the ³Left² dogmatist and sectarian comrades to responsible
positions in the central leading body on the one hand; on the other,
they excessively attacked those comrades who had committed the
errors of the Li Li-san line, wrongly attacked those comrades headed
by Chu Chiu-pai7 who were alleged to have committed ³the error of
the line of conciliation², and immediately after the session the Cen-
tral Committee wrongly attacked the great majority of the so-called
³Rightist² comrades.  In fact, the then ³Rightists² were mainly the
creation of the factionalist struggle ³against the Right deviation² con-
ducted at this session.  Of course, among these people there was a
handful of splitters headed by Lo Chang-lung, who later became real
Rightists, degenerated into counter-revolutionaries and were perma-
nently expelled from the Party, and who, beyond any doubt, had to
be resolutely combated; their establishment of a duplicate Party
organization and their persistence in maintaining it were absolutely
impermissible according to Party discipline.  But as for Lin Yu-nan,8
Li Chiu-shih,9 Ho Meng-hsiung10 and some twenty other important
Party cadres who were then attacked, they had done much useful work
for the Party and the people and maintained close ties with the masses,
and when they were arrested shortly afterwards, they stood firm and
unyielding before the enemy and died as heroes.  Comrade Chu Chiu-
pai, who was alleged to have committed ³the error of the line of
conciliation², was then a Party leader of prestige, and after he was
attacked, he continued to do much useful work (mainly in the cultural
field) and died heroically in June 1935 at the hands of the enemy
executioners.  The memory of the proletarian heroism of all these
comrades should be cherished for ever.  The kind of ³reform² which
the Fourth Plenary Session carried out in the central body was like-
wise extended to the local organizations in all the revolutionary bases
and White areas.  As compared with the Third Plenary Session and
the subsequent central leadership, the central leadership after the
Fourth Plenary Session was more insistent and more systematic in
sending its representatives, agencies or new leading cadres to all parts
of the country to carry through its fight ³against the Right deviation².
	The resolutions issued by the central leadership on May 9, 1931,
shortly after the Fourth Plenary Session, showed that the new ³Left²

189 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
line was already being concretely applied and developed in practical
work.  Then a series of major events occurred in China.  Before the
central leadership following the Fourth Plenary Session had time to
carry through its erroneous line, the Red Army of the Central Area
in Kiangsi, under the correct leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung
and through the vigorous efforts of all comrades, won great victories
and smashed the enemy¹s second and third campaigns of ³encirclement
and suppression²; most of the other revolutionary base areas and Red
Army units also won many victories and made much progress in the
same period and under the same conditions.  Meanwhile, the Japanese
imperialist invasion, which began with the September 18th Incident
in 1931, aroused a new upsurge in the national democratic movement
throughout the country.  From the very beginning, the new central
leadership made an entirely wrong appraisal of the new situation
created by these events.  It greatly exaggerated both the current crisis
of the Kuomintang regime and the growth of the revolutionary forces;
it ignored the fact that after the September 18th Incident the national
contradiction between China and Japan was mounting and that the
intermediate classes were making demands for resistance to Japan and
for democracy; it emphasized that Japanese imperialism and other
imperialist powers would combine to attack the Soviet Union and
that the imperialist powers, the Chinese counter-revolutionary cliques
and even the intermediate groups would combine to attack the Chinese
revolution; and it categorically asserted that the intermediate groups
were the most dangerous enemy of the Chinese revolution.  The new
central leadership therefore continued to advocate ³down with every-
thing² and held that ³the very heart of the political situation in China
is a life-and-death struggle between counter-revolution and revolu-
tion²; hence it once again put forward many adventurist proposals,
such as the seizure of key cities by the Red Army in order to win
victory first in one or more provinces, the arming of workers and
peasants everywhere in the White areas and the calling of general
strikes there.  These errors first found expression in its ³Resolution
on the Urgent Tasks Arising from the Smashing of the Enemy¹s
Third Campaign of Encirclement and Suppression¹ by the Workers¹
and Peasants¹ Red Army and from the Gradual Maturing of the
Revolutionary Crisis², dated September 20, 1931.  They were repeated
and given fuller expression in the following documents, which were
drawn up either by the subsequent provisional central leadership or
under its guidance:

190 MAO TSE-TUNG 
	³Resolution on the Forcible Occupation of Manchuria by
Japanese Imperialism² (September 22, 1931);
	³Resolution on the Struggle for the Victory of the Revolution
First in One or More Provinces² (January 9, 1932);
	³Resolution on the January 28th Incident² (February 26, 1932);
	³Opportunist Vacillation Within the Communist Party of
China in the Struggle for the Victory of the Chinese Revolution
First in One or More Provinces² (April 4, 1932);
	³Resolution of the Central Area Bureau of the Central Com-
mittee on Leadership of and Participation in a Campaign Week
Against the Imperialist Attack on the Soviet Union and Against
Partition of China and for Extending the National Revolutionary
War² (May 11, 1932); and
	³The Mounting Revolutionary Crisis and the Tasks of the
Party in Northern China² (June 24, 1932).

	The period from the establishment of the provisional central
leadership headed by Comrade Chin Pang-hsien (Po Ku)11 in Sep-
tember 1931 to the Tsunyi Meeting in January 1935 was one of continued
development of the third ³Left² line.  During this period, because of
the serious damage the incorrect line had done to the work in the
White areas, the provisional central leadership moved to the southern
Kiangsi base area early in 1933, and this move facilitated the further
application of its incorrect line there and in the neighbouring base
areas.  Before that, the correct line followed in the base areas of
southern Kiangsi and western Fukien had already been maligned by
the Party congress of the southern Kiangsi base area in November 1931
and by the Ningtu Meeting of the Central Bureau of the Red Base Areas
in August 1932, in accordance with the erroneous programme of the
Fourth Plenary Session ³against the Right deviation² and for ³reform-
ing the leading bodies at all levels²  the correct line had been called
a ³rich peasant line² and an ³error of the most serious and consistent
Right opportunism² and the correct Party and military leadership had
been removed.  Nevertheless, owing to the profound influence in the
Red Army of Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s correct strategic principles, the
campaign against the fourth ³encirclement and suppression² achieved
victory in the spring of 1933 before the erroneous line of the provisional
central leadership had been fully enforced in the army.  On the other
hand, an utterly wrong strategy gained complete control in the campaign
against the fifth ³encirclement and suppression², which started at the

191 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
close of 1933.  In many other policies, too, and particularly in the policy re-
garding the Fukien Incident, the erroneous ³Left² line was fully applied.
	The Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee, con-
vened by the provisional central leadership in January 1934, marked
the peak of the development of the third ³Left² line.  Disregarding
the setbacks which the ³Left² line had caused the Chinese revolution-
ary movement and the people¹s anti-Japanese democratic movement
in the Kuomintang areas after the incidents of September 18, 1931 and
January 28, 1932, the Fifth Plenary Session blindly concluded that ³the
revolutionary crisis in China has reached a new acute stage  an im-
mediate revolutionary situation exists in China² and that the struggle
against the fifth ³encirclement and suppression² was a ³struggle for
the complete victory of the Chinese revolution², which would decide
for China ³the question of who conquers whom¹, of the road of
revolution or the road of colonialism².  Repeating the views of the
Li Li-san line, this session declared that ³when we have extended the
democratic revolution of the workers and peasants to important parts
of China, the socialist revolution will become the basic task of the
Communist Party; only on this basis can China be unified and the
Chinese people achieve national liberation², etc., etc.  Using the slogans
of fighting ³Right opportunism, the main danger², ³fighting the con-
ciliatory attitude towards Right opportunism² and fighting ³the use
of double-dealing to sabotage the Party line in practical work², it
continued and developed the excessive factional struggles and the
policy of attacking comrades.
	In the revolutionary base areas the most disastrous consequence
of the third ³Left² line was the failure of the campaign against the
fifth ³encirclement and suppression² in the area where the central
leading body was located and the withdrawal from there of the main
forces of the Red Army.  In the military operations during the with-
drawal from Kiangsi and on the Long March, a different error, the
error of flightism, was committed under the ³Left² line, causing
further losses to the Red Army.  Similarly, on account of the domina-
tion of the ³Left² line, the Party¹s work suffered defeat in most of
the other revolutionary bases (the Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi area,
the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei area, the Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi area, the
Hunan-Kiangsi area, the western Hunan-Hupeh area and the Sze-
chuan-Shensi area) and in the vast White areas.  As for the Chang
Kuo-tao line, which once dominated the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei and
the Szechuan-Shensi areas, it not only was a ³Left² line of the general

192 MAO TSE-TUNG 
type but was also characterized by a particularly serious form of war-
lordism and by flightism in the face of enemy attacks.
	Such was the main content of the erroneous ³Left² line which
dominated the whole Party for the third time and the leaders of
which were the two dogmatists, Comrades Chen Shao-yu and Chin
Pang-hsien.
	Cloaking themselves in ³Marxist-Leninist theory² and relying on
the political and organizational prestige and influence built up by the
Fourth Plenary Session, those comrades who were guilty of dogmatist
errors were responsible for the domination of the third ³Left² line
in the Party for four long years, gave it the fullest and most systematic
expression ideologically, politically, militarily and organizationally,
and enabled it to exercise the most profound influence in the Party
and consequently to do the greatest damage.  Nevertheless, in defiance
of the facts, the comrades guilty of this wrong line bragged long and
hard about the ³correctness² and the ³immortal achievements² of the
line of the central leadership following the Fourth Plenary Session,
using such dogmatic phrases as ³further bolshevization of the Com-
munist Party of China² and ³100 per cent Bolshevik².  Thus they
completely distorted the history of the Party.
	The comrades who advocated the correct line, with Comrade Mao
Tse-tung as their representative, were diametrically opposed to the
third ³Left² line during the period of its domination.  They disagreed
with the ³Left² line and demanded that it should be corrected, and
as a result their correct leadership was everywhere overthrown by the
central leadership that followed the Fourth Plenary Session and by
the agencies or representatives it dispatched.  But the repeated failures
of the ³Left² line in practical work, and especially the repeated
defeats in the campaign against the fifth ³encirclement and suppres-
sion² in the area where the central leading body was located, had begun
to reveal the wrongness of this line to more and more leading cadres
and rank-and-file Party members and to arouse their doubt and dis-
satisfaction.  After the Red Army in that area set out on the Long
March, this doubt and dissatisfaction grew to such an extent that some
comrades who had committed ³Left² errors began to awaken and take
a stand against them.  Accordingly, large numbers of cadres and Party
members who were opposed to the ³Left² line rallied under the leader-
ship of Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  It was therefore possible for the
enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee,
held under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung in January 1935

193 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
at the city of Tsunyi in Kweichow Province, triumphantly to put an
end to the domination of the ³Left² line in the central leading body
and to save the Party at that most critical juncture.
	The Tsunyi Meeting was entirely correct in concentrating all its
efforts on rectifying the military and organizational errors, which at
that time were of decisive significance.  The meeting inaugurated a
new central leadership, headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung  a his-
toric change of paramount importance in the Chinese Communist
Party.  Precisely because of this change, our Party was able to con-
clude the Long March victoriously, to preserve and steel a hard core
of cadres in the Party and the Red Army under the extremely
difficult and dangerous conditions of the Long March, successfully to
overcome the line of Chang Kuo-tao who insisted on retreating and
fleeing and actually set up a duplicate Party, to save the northern
Shensi revolutionary base area from the crisis brought about by the
³Left² line,12 to lead the national salvation movement of December
9, 1935 correctly, to settle the Sian Incident of 1936 correctly, to organize
the Anti-Japanese National United Front, and to set in motion the
sacred War of Resistance Against Japan.
	Since the Tsunyi Meeting, the political line of the central leading
body of the Party, led by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, has been entirely
correct.  The ³Left² line has been gradually overcome politically,
militarily and organizationally.  Since 1942, under the leadership of
Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the Party-wide movement for the rectifica-
tion of subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing and
also for the study of Party history has corrected, at their very ideo-
logical roots, the various ³Left² and Right errors that have arisen in
the history of the Party.  The overwhelming majority of the comrades
who committed ³Left² or Right errors have made great progress
through a long process of learning from experience and have done
much good work for the Party and the people.  They are now united
with the masses of other comrades on the basis of a common political
understanding.  This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session is happy to
point out that through its successes and reverses our Party has at last
attained, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the un-
precedentedly high level of solidarity and unity it now enjoys
ideologically, politically, organizationally and militarily.  It is a Party
that will soon win victory, a Party no force can conquer.
	This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session holds that, since the stage
of the War of Resistance is not yet concluded, it is appropriate to

194 MAO TSE-TUNG 
postpone to a future date the drawing of conclusions on certain ques-
tions in the history of the Party during the War of Resistance.


IV

	In order that comrades may have a better understanding of the
errors of the various ³Left² lines, and particularly of the third ³Left²
line, so that, ³learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones², they
may prevent the recurrence of such errors, we set forth the main
content of these lines where they were contrary to the correct line
politically, militarily, organizationally and ideologically.
	1.  Politically:
	As Comrade Stalin pointed out13 and as Comrade Mao Tse-tung
has analysed in detail, China at the present stage is a semi-colonial
and semi-feudal country (reduced in some parts to a colony since the
September 18th Incident), and the Chinese revolution since World
War I has been a national democratic revolution in the era in which
the international proletariat has won victory in the Soviet Union and
the Chinese proletariat has awakened politically.  This determines the
character of the Chinese revolution at the present stage as an anti-
imperialist and anti-feudal revolution under the leadership of the
proletariat, with the workers and peasants forming the main body and
with other broad social strata taking part, i.e., it is a new-democratic
revolution, distinct both from the old democratic revolution and from
a socialist revolution.  As China at the present stage is a large semi-
colonial and semi-feudal country, dominated by a number of powerful
yet conflicting imperialist countries and by the feudal forces of China,
her economic and political development is extremely uneven and
lacking in uniformity.  This determines the extreme unevenness in the
development of China¹s new-democratic revolution and renders it
necessary for the revolution to go through a protracted, tortuous
struggle before nation-wide victory can be achieved; at the same time,
this renders it possible in the struggle to make extensive use of the
enemy¹s contradictions and to set up and maintain armed revolution-
ary base areas, first in those vast territories where the enemy¹s control
is comparatively weak.  These basic characteristics and basic laws of
the Chinese revolution, which have been verified by Chinese revolu-
tionary practice, were not comprehended but were contravened both

195 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
by the various Right lines and by the various ³Left² lines, an
especially by the third ³Left² line.  Therefore, the ³Left² lines were
wrong politically in three main respects.
	First.  The various ³Left² lines were in error, above all, on the
question of the task of the revolution and the question of class relations.
As far back as the period of the First Great Revolution, Comrade
Mao Tse-tung, like Comrade Stalin, pointed out not only that the
task of the Chinese revolution in its present stage is to fight imperial-
ism and feudalism, but also, and more particularly, that the peasants¹
struggle for land is the fundamental content of the fight against
imperialism and feudalism in China, that the Chinese bourgeois-
democratic revolution is in essence a peasant revolution and that the
basic task of the Chinese proletariat in the bourgeois-democrat
revolution is therefore to lead the peasants¹ struggle.14  In the early
period of the Agrarian Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Tse-tung
again pointed out that what China still needed was the bourgeois-
democratic revolution and that China ³must go through such a
democratic revolution² before one could speak of the prospect of
socialism.15  He stated that the Agrarian Revolution was all the more
important because of the defeat of the revolution in the cities and that
³in the revolution in semi-colonial China, the peasant struggle must
always fail if it does not have the leadership of the workers, but the
revolution is never harmed if the peasant struggle outstrips the forces
of the workers².16  He pointed out that after the big bourgeoisie¹s
betrayal of the revolution there was still a difference between the liberal
bourgeoisie and the comprador bourgeoisie; that there were still broad
strata of people who demanded democracy and especially demanded
a fight against imperialism; that it was therefore necessary to treat the
various intermediate classes correctly and do everything possible to
make an alliance with them or neutralize them; and that in the country-
side it was necessary to treat the middle and rich peasants correctly
(³taking from those who have a surplus and giving to those who have
a shortage and taking from those who have better and giving to those
who have worse² while firmly uniting with the middle peasants, pro-
tecting the well-to-do middle peasants, providing certain economic
opportunities for the rich peasants and also enabling the ordinary
landlord to make a living).17  These are all basic ideas of New
Democracy, yet they were not understood and were opposed by the
exponents of the ³Left² line.  Although many of the revolutionary tasks
set by the various ³Left² lines were democratic in character, the

196 MAO TSE-TUNG 
exponents of the ³Left² lines were invariably confused about the
definite distinction between the democratic revolution and the socialist
revolution and subjectively were anxious to go beyond the democratic
revolution; they invariably underestimated the decisive role of the
peasants¹ anti-feudal struggle in the Chinese revolution; and they
invariably advocated a struggle against the bourgeoisie as a whole,
including even the upper petty bourgeoisie.  The third ³Left² line went
further and put the struggle against the bourgeoisie on a par with the
struggle against imperialism and feudalism, denied the existence of an
intermediate camp and of third parties and groups and laid particular
stress on the struggle against the rich peasants.  Especially after the
September 18th Incident in 1931, there was an obvious and great change
in China¹s class relations, but, so far from recognizing this change, the
third ³Left² line categorically labelled as ³the most dangerous enemy²
those intermediate groups which had contradictions with the reaction-
ary Kuomintang rule and were taking positive action.  It should be
said that the exponents of the third ³Left² line did lead the peasants
in distributing the land, in setting up political power and in offering
armed resistance to the attacks of the Kuomintang government.  All
these undertakings were correct.  However, owing to the ³Left² views
mentioned above, they were mistakenly afraid to acknowledge that the
Red Army movement was a peasant movement led by the proletariat,
and they mistakenly opposed what they called the ³peculiar revolu-
tionariness of the peasants², ³peasant capitalism² and ³the rich peasant
line².  Instead, they carried out a number of so-called ³class-line²
policies going beyond the democratic revolution, for instance, a policy
of eliminating the rich peasant economy and other ultra-Left economic
and labour policies; a state policy in which no exploiters had any
political rights; a policy of popular education which in its content
stressed communism; an ultra-Left policy towards the intellectuals; a
policy of working among enemy troops to win over only the soldiers
but not the officers; and an ultra-Left policy in the suppression of
counter-revolutionaries.  Thus, the immediate tasks of the revolution
were distorted, the revolutionary forces were isolated and the Red
Army movement suffered setbacks.  Similarly, it should be said that
in the Kuomintang areas after the defeat of the revolution in 1927,
our Party persevered in leading the people¹s national democratic
movement, in leading the economic struggles of the workers and the
other masses and the revolutionary cultural movement, and in fighting
the Kuomintang government¹s policies of betraying the national in-

197 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
terests and oppressing the people.  After the September 18th Incident,
in particular, our Party led the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army,
supported the war of January 28, 1932 and the Anti-Japanese Allied
Army in northern Chahar, formed an anti-Japanese democratic
alliance with the Fukien People¹s Government, put forward three
conditions on which the Red Army would ally with the Kuomintang
troops to resist Japan18 and six conditions for forming a Committee
for National Armed Self-Defence with all sections of the people,19
and on August 1, 1935 issued ³An Appeal to All Fellow-Countrymen
for Resistance to Japan and for National Salvation² which called for
the formation of a government of national defence and of an anti-
Japanese united army.  All this too was correct.  But because the guiding
policy was erroneous during the dominance of the various ³Left² lines,
and especially of the third, the Party was unable to solve problems
correctly in practice and consequently, in the Kuomintang areas too,
the Party¹s work either did not achieve such results as it should have,
or ended in failure.  On the question of resistance to Japan, of course
it was not yet possible to foresee the changes that would take place
after the Northern China Incident of 1935, and particularly after the
Sian Incident of 1936, within the Kuomintang¹s chief ruling groups,
which represented the main sections of China¹s big landlords and big
bourgeoisie.  But the intermediate strata and some local groups of the
big landlords and big bourgeoisie were already changing into our
allies against Japan.  While this change was recognized by the broad
ranks of our Party members and the people, it was either ignored or
denied by the exponents of the third ³Left² line, who thus created a
serious state of closed-doorism and fell far behind the Chinese people
in political life.  This state of isolation and lagging behind, which
resulted from the error of closed-doorism, remained basically un-
changed until the Tsunyi Meeting.
	Second.  The various ³Left² lines were in error on the question of
revolutionary war and revolutionary base areas.  Comrade Stalin said,
³In China the armed revolution is fighting the armed counter-
revolution.  That is one of the specific features and one of the advan-
tages of the Chinese revolution.²20  Like Comrade Stalin, Comrade Mao
Tse-tung had correctly pointed out as far back as the early period of the
Agrarian Revolutionary War that, in the Chinese revolution, armed
struggle is the main form of struggle and an army composed chiefly
of peasants is the main form of organization, for the reason that semi-
colonial and semi-feudal China is a large, non-uniform country which

198 MAO TSE-TUNG 
lacks democracy and industry.  Comrade Mao Tse-tung also pointed
out that the vast rural areas inhabited by the broad masses of the
peasantry are the indispensable, vital positions of the Chinese revolu-
tion (revolutionary villages can encircle the cities, but revolutionary
cities cannot detach themselves from the villages), and that China
can and must establish armed revolutionary base areas as the starting
point for country-wide victory (democratic unification of the whole
country).21  In the period of the 1924-27 revolution, when a coalition
government had been formed through Kuomintang-Communist co-
operation, the base areas had certain big cities as their centres, but
even then, in order to consolidate the foundations of the base areas,
it was necessary, under the leadership of the proletariat, to build a
people¹s army with the peasants as the main body and solve the land
problem in the rural areas.  But in the period of the Agrarian Revolu-
tionary War, since the cities were all occupied by powerful counter-
revolutionary forces, base areas had to be set up, expanded and
consolidated mainly by relying on peasant guerrilla warfare (not on
positional warfare) and first of all in the countryside where counter-
revolutionary rule was weak (and not in the key cities).  Comrade
Mao Tse-tung pointed out that in China the historical conditions for
the existence of such armed revolutionary rural base areas are the
³localized agricultural economy (not a unified capitalist economy) and
the imperialist policy of marking off spheres of influence in order to
divide and exploit² and the resulting ³prolonged splits and wars
within the White regime².22  He also pointed out the historic significance
of such base areas for the Chinese revolution:

	Only thus is it possible to build the confidence of the revolu-
tionary masses throughout the country, as the Soviet Union has
built it throughout the world.  Only thus is it possible to create
tremendous difficulties for the reactionary ruling classes, shake
their foundations and hasten their internal disintegration.  Only
thus is it really possible to create a Red Army which will become
the chief weapon for the great revolution of the future.  In short,
only thus is it possible to hasten the revolutionary high tide.23

As for mass work in the cities during that period, the principal policies
should have been those advocated by Comrade Liu Shao-chi, the ex-
ponent of the correct line for work in the White areas, namely, to
act chiefly on the defensive (and not on the offensive); to utilize all
possible legal opportunities for work (and not to reject the use of

199 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
legality) so that the Party organizations could go deep among the
masses, work under cover for a long time and accumulate strength;
and always to be ready to send people to develop armed struggle in
the rural areas, and thereby to co-ordinate with the struggle in the
countryside and advance the development of the revolutionary situa-
tion.  Therefore, until such time as the general situation again made
it possible to form democratic governments in the cities, the Chinese
revolutionary movement should have made rural work primary and
urban work supplementary.  Victories of the revolution in the country-
side and temporary inability to win victories in the cities, offensives in
the countryside and a general defensive position in the cities, even
victory and the offensive in one rural area and defeat, retreat and the
defensive in another  all these formed the criss-cross pattern of
revolution and counter-revolution up and down the country during
that period and accordingly determined the course from defeat to
victory which the revolution had to follow.  But the exponents of the
various ³Left² lines did not understand the specific features of
semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese society, did not understand that
the bourgeois-democratic revolution in China was in essence a peasant
revolution and did not understand the uneven, tortuous and protracted
nature of the Chinese revolution; therefore they underestimated the
importance of military struggle, and especially of peasant guerrilla
warfare and rural base areas, and opposed what they called ³the
doctrine of the gun² and the ³localism and conservatism characteristic
of peasant mentality².  They were for ever dreaming that the struggles
of the workers and the other masses in the cities would suddenly break
through the enemy¹s severe repression and surge forward, erupt into
armed insurrections in key cities, achieve ³victory first in one or more
provinces², and bring about a so-called nation-wide revolutionary high
tide and nation-wide victory; and they made this dream the basis on
which all their work was planned and organized.  In reality, however,
given the general relation of class forces after the defeat of the revolu-
tion in 1927, the first result of this dream was none other than the
failure of the urban work itself.  This was how the first ³Left² line met
with defeat; the second ³Left² line repeated the same error, the only
difference being that now support was demanded from the Red Army,
for the Red Army had become a considerable force.  The second ³Left²
line too ended in failure, yet the third ³Left² line continued to demand
³real² preparations for armed insurrections in the big cities, the only
difference being that now the main demand was for the Red Army to

200 MAO TSE-TUNG 
seize big cities, because it had grown even stronger, while the work
in the cities had shrunk even further.  The result of subordinating rural
work to city work, instead of the other way round, was that after the
work in the cities failed, most of the rural work failed too.  It should
be pointed out that after 1932 the actions aimed at capturing key cities
had in fact come to a halt because the Red Army could not capture
or hold them, and particularly because the Kuomintang was attacking
on a large scale; furthermore, after 1933, owing to the still greater
damage done to our city work, the provisional central leadership
itself moved from the city to a rural base area.  Thus a change did
take place.  But as far as the comrades pursuing the ³Left² line were
concerned, this change was not made consciously or as a result of correct
conclusions reached through a study of the specific characteristics of
the Chinese revolution; therefore they continued to direct all the work
in the Red Army and the base areas from their erroneous urban view-
point, and caused great damage to the work.  The following instances
are clear proof: they advocated positional warfare and opposed
guerrilla warfare or mobile warfare of a guerrilla character; they
wrongly stressed what they called ³regularization² of the Red Army
and opposed its so-called ³guerrilla-ism²; they did not realize that
they had to adapt themselves to dispersed rural areas and to protracted
guerrilla warfare in areas cut off from one another by the enemy, and
so they did not use the manpower and material resources in the base
areas sparingly or take other necessary measures; in the campaign
against the fifth ³encirclement and suppression² they put forward the
wrong slogans of ³The decisive battle as between the two roads for
China² and ³Do not yield a single inch of territory in the base
areas².
	This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session declares emphatically that
a change in the situation is now imminent, the very change our rural
work should have promoted and our city work should have awaited
in the period discussed above.  Only now, in the final stage of the War
of Resistance Against Japan, when the army under our Party¹s leader-
ship has grown strong and will grow still stronger, is it correct to place
work in the Japanese-occupied cities on a par with work in the
Liberated Areas, actively to prepare all the conditions for annihilating
the Japanese aggressors in the key cities by co-ordinated attacks from
within and without and then to shift the centre of gravity of our work
to these cities.  This will be a new change of historic significance for
our Party, which shifted the centre of gravity of its work to the country-

201 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
side with so much difficulty after the defeat of the revolution in 1927.
All Party members should prepare for this change with full political
awareness and should not repeat the error of the ³Left² line on the
matter of the shift from the cities to the countryside during the
Agrarian Revolutionary War, an error which was manifested first in
opposing and refusing a shift and then in shifting reluctantly under
compulsion and without political awareness.  In the Kuomintang areas,
however, conditions are different; there our immediate tasks, whether
in the countryside or in the cities, are to go all out to mobilize the
masses, resolutely to oppose a split and civil war, to strive for unity
and peace and to demand redoubled efforts in the war against Japan,
the abolition of the Kuomintang¹s one-party dictatorship and the
formation of a unified democratic coalition government.  When the
Japanese-occupied cities are liberated by the people and a unified
democratic coalition government is really established and consolidated,
the rural base areas will have accomplished their historical task.
	Third.  The various ³Left² lines were also in error on the directing
of tactics for attack and defence.  Correct direction of tactics, as
Comrade Stalin points out, requires a correct analysis of the situation
(a correct estimate of the relation of class forces and a correct judge-
ment of the ebb and flow of the movement), requires correct forms
of struggle and organization based thereon, and requires correctly
³taking advantage of every rift in the camp of its enemies, and the
ability to find allies²;24 and one of the best models is Comrade Mao
Tse-tung¹s direction of the Chinese revolutionary movement.  After
the defeat of the revolution in 1927, Comrade Mao Tse-tung correctly
pointed out that the tide of revolution was at a low ebb throughout
the country, that the enemy was stronger than we in the country as
a whole, and that adventurist attacks would court inevitable defeat,
but that it was possible for ³one or more small areas under Red
political power² to emerge ³in the midst of a White regime which
encircles them²25 in the general conditions in which there were inces-
sant splits and wars within the reactionary regime and the demand
of the people for revolution was gradually reviving and growing, and
in the specific conditions in which the masses had gone through the
struggles of the First Great Revolution, there was a Red Army pos-
sessing considerable strength and there was a Communist Party with
correct policies.  He also stated that in a period when there are splits
within the ruling classes the expansion of Red political power ³can
be comparatively adventurous and the area carved out by military

202 MAO TSE-TUNG 
operations can be comparatively large², whereas in a period of
relative stability for the ruling classes, such expansion
must be one of gradual advance.  In such a period, the worst thing
in military affairs is to divide our forces for an adventurous
advance, and the worst thing in local work (distributing land,
establishing political power, expanding the Party and organizing
local armed forces) is to scatter our personnel and neglect to lay
a solid foundation in the central districts.26
Even within one and the same period, our tactics should vary accord-
ing to our enemies¹ differences in strength; therefore, the area we
carved out on the Hunan-Kiangsi border was ³on the defensive against
Hunan with its comparatively strong ruling power, and take the offen-
sive against Kiangsi with its comparatively weak ruling power².27
Later, when the Red Army of the Hunan-Kiangsi border reached the
Fukien-Kiangsi border, a plan was proposed to ³contend . . . for Kiangsi
Province and also for western Fukien and western Chekiang².28  An
important basis for determining our varying tactics is the different
impact of the revolution on the interests of different enemies.  Conse-
quently Comrade Mao Tse-tung has always advocated that we ³utilize
every conflict within the counter-revolution and take active measures
to widen the cleavages within it²,29 and ³oppose the policy of isolation,
and affirm the policy of winning over all possible allies².30  The ap-
plication of the tactical principles, ³make use of contradictions, win
over the many, oppose the few and crush our enemies one by one²,31
was brilliantly developed in the campaigns Comrade Mao Tse-tung
led against ³encirclement and suppression² and especially, after the
Tsunyi Meeting, in the Long March and in the work of the Anti-
Japanese National United Front.  Comrade Liu Shao-chi¹s ideas on
tactics for work in the White areas are likewise a model.  Correctly
taking into account the glaring disparity between the enemy¹s strength
and our own in the White areas, and particularly in the cities, after
the defeat of the revolution in 1927, Comrade Liu Shao-chi advocated
systematic organization of our retreat and defence and ³the avoidance
of decisive engagements with the enemy for the time being, while the
situation and conditions are unfavourable to us², in order ³to prepare
for revolutionary attacks and decisive engagements in the future².32
He also advocated that the Party¹s open organizations of the period
of the 1924-27 revolution be transformed systematically and strictly
into underground organizations, while ³utilizing open legal means as
far as possible² in mass work to enable the Party¹s underground

203 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
organizations to conceal their strength for a long time in such mass
work, go deep among the masses and ³accumulate and strengthen the
forces of the masses and heighten their political consciousness².33
With respect to leadership in mass struggles, Comrade Liu Shao-chi
held that it was necessary,
in accordance with the situation and the specific conditions at a
given time and place and the degree of political consciousness of
the masses, to advance limited slogans, demands and forms of
struggle acceptable to the masses in order to set the mass struggle
in motion and then, in accordance with the changing conditions
in the course of the struggle, either gradually to raise the mass
struggle to a higher stage or, ³knowing how far to go², temporarily
to conclude the battle so as to prepare for the next battle at a
higher stage and on a larger scale.
On the question of utilizing the enemy¹s internal contradictions and
winning temporary allies, he held that it was necessary
to push these contradictions to the breaking point and form a tem-
porary alliance against the chief enemy with those elements in the
enemy camp who may co-operate with us or who are not yet our
chief enemy;
and
to make necessary concessions to the allies who are willing to co-
operate with us, induce them to join with us and participate in
common action and then influence them and win over their mass
following.34
The success of the December 9th Movement in 1935 proved the cor-
rectness of these tactical principles for work in the White areas.  In con-
trast to such correct direction of tactics, the comrades taking the various
³Left² lines failed to examine the balance of forces between the enemy
and ourselves objectively, failed to adopt corresponding forms of
struggle and organization and did not recognize or pay sufficient at-
tention to the enemy¹s internal contradictions.  Therefore, not only did
they meet with defeat as a result of blindly executing a so-called
³offensive line² when they should have been on the defensive, they
also met with defeat even when an offensive was timely, because they
did not know how to organize a victorious offensive.  Their way of
³appraising a situation² was to take individual, incipient, indirect,
one-sided and superficial phenomena favourable to their viewpoint
and magnify them into something widespread, grave, direct, all-sided
and essential, and they were afraid to acknowledge or were blind to

204 MAO TSE-TUNG 
all facts not in conformity with their viewpoint (such as the enemy¹s
strength and temporary victory, our weakness and temporary defeat,
the inadequate political consciousness of the masses, the enemy¹s
internal contradictions and the progressive side of the middle-of-
the-roaders).  They never envisaged the most difficult and complex
situations which might arise; they always dreamed about the most
favourable and simplest situations which could not possibly arise.  In
the Red Army movement, they invariably described the enemy en-
circling the revolutionary base areas as ³terribly shaky², ³extremely
panicky², ³approaching final extinction², ³collapsing at an accelerat-
ing speed², ³totally collapsing², and so on.  The exponents of the third
³Left² line even held that the Red Army enjoyed superiority over the
entire Kuomintang forces, which outnumbered it many times, and
therefore kept on pressing the Red Army to make reckless advances
regardless of the conditions and even without resting.  They denied
the unevenness of revolutionary development as between southern
and northern China resulting from the 1924-27 revolution (a situation
that was not reversed until the War of Resistance Against Japan),
wrongly opposed what they called ³the theory of the backwardness
of the north² and demanded the establishment of Red regimes every-
where in the countryside of northern China and the organization of
mutinies in all the White armies there so as to form Red Army units.
They also denied the unevenness of development as between the
central and border sections of the base areas and wrongly opposed
what they called the ³Lo Ming line².35  They refused to make use of
the contradictions among the warlords attacking the Red Army and
to reach compromises with those forces which were willing to stop
attacking.  As for work in the White areas, they refused to take the
necessary steps for retreat and defence or to make use of all legal
possibilities in the cities where the revolutionary tide had ebbed and
the counter-revolutionary ruling forces were very powerful.  Instead,
they continued to take the offensive in forms inadmissible under the
prevailing conditions, they set up large unprotected Party organiza-
tions and various ³Red mass organizations² divorced from the masses
and duplicating the Party, they constantly and regardless of conditions
called for and organized political strikes, joint strikes, and strikes of
students, merchants, troops and policemen, and also parades and
demonstrations, lightning meetings and even armed insurrections 
actions which were unlikely or unable to win the participation or support
of the masses  and they misrepresented the failures of these actions

205 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
as ³victories².  To sum up, the comrades taking the various ³Left²
lines, and particularly the third, were versed in nothing but closed-
doorism and adventurism, they believed blindly in ³struggle above all
and all for struggle² and in ³continuously expanding the struggle and
raising it to a higher level², and they therefore continuously met with
defeats which should not have occurred and could have been avoided.
	2.  Militarily:
	At the present stage of the Chinese revolution, military struggle
is the main form of political struggle.  During the Agrarian Revolu-
tionary War it became the most urgent question in the Party
line.  Comrade Mao Tse-tung has applied Marxism-Leninism and
formulated not only the correct political line for the Chinese revolu-
tion, but also, beginning with the period of the Agrarian Revolutionary
War, the correct military line subordinate to this political line.  Com-
rade Mao Tse-tung¹s military line proceeds from two fundamental
points.  First, our army is and can be an army of only one kind; it must
be an instrument subordinate to the ideological leadership of the pro-
letariat and serving the struggle of the people and the building of
revolutionary base areas.  Second, our war is and can be a war of only
one kind; it must be a war in which we recognize that the enemy
is strong and we are weak, that the enemy is big and we are small,
and in which therefore we fully utilize the enemy¹s weaknesses and
our strong points and fully rely on the strength of the masses for
survival, victory and expansion.  From the first point, it follows that
the Red Army (now the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army
and the other armed forces of the people) must fight whole-heartedly
for the line, programme and policies of the Party, that is, for all the
manifold interests of the whole people, and must combat the tend-
encies towards warlordism which run counter to this.  Therefore,
the Red Army must oppose the purely military point of view and
the roving-rebel ideology, according to which the military does not
obey the political, or even commands the political.  The Red Army
must simultaneously shoulder the threefold task of fighting, doing
mass work and raising funds (which at present means production);
doing mass work means becoming a propagandist and organizer for
the Party and for the people¹s political power and means helping
the local people in land distribution (at present, the reduction of rent
and interest) and in establishing armed forces, organs of political
power, and Party organizations.  Hence, in its relations with the
government and the people, it is required that the Red Army

206 MAO TSE-TUNG 
scrupulously respect the organs of the people¹s political power and
the mass organizations, strengthen their prestige and strictly observe
the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Atten-
tion.36  Within the army it is necessary to establish a correct relation-
ship between officers and men and to have both an appropriate
democratic life and an authoritative military discipline based on
political consciousness.  In the work among the enemy troops, it is
necessary to have a correct policy for disintegrating enemy forces and
winning over prisoners.  From the second point of departure, it fol-
lows that the Red Army had to recognize that, during the period
of the Agrarian Revolutionary War, guerrilla warfare and mobile
warfare of a guerrilla character were the main forms of warfare,
and must recognize that only a people¹s war, in which the main forces
are integrated with regional forces, the regular army with guerrilla
units and people¹s militia, and the armed masses with the unarmed
masses, can bring victory over an enemy many times stronger than
ourselves.  Hence, in strategy, the Red Army must oppose a war of
quick decision, and in tactics, must oppose protracted fighting; in
strategy, it must adhere firmly to protracted warfare and in tactics,
to quick decisions; in campaigns and battles it must oppose the use
of the few to defeat the many and must adhere firmly to the use of
the many to defeat the few.  The Red Army must therefore carry out
the following strategic and tactical principles:

	Divide our forces to arouse the masses, concentrate our forces
to deal with the enemy.
	The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass;
the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue.
	To extend stable base areas, employ the policy of advancing
in waves; when pursued by a powerful enemy, employ the policy
of circling around.37
	Lure the enemy in deep.38
	Concentrate superior forces, pick out the enemy¹s weak spots,
and fight when you are sure of wiping out part, or the greater
part, of the enemy in mobile warfare, so as to crush the enemy
forces one by one.39

Militarily, the various ³Left² lines were diametrically opposed to the
line of Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  The putschism of the first ³Left²
line caused the Red Army to become alienated from the masses of
the people; the second ³Left² line led the Red Army into adventurist

207 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
attacks.  But neither was completely systematized militarily.  A fully
articulated system emerged only with the third ³Left² line.  On the
question of building the army, the exponents of the third ³Left² line
reduced the Red Army¹s threefold task to the single one of fighting
and neglected to educate the Red Army on the correct relations
between army and people, between army and government and between
officers and men; they demanded undue regularization and opposed
the then sound guerrilla character of the Red Army as ³guerrilla-ism²;
furthermore, they fostered formalism in the political work in the army.
On the question of military operations, they denied the premise that
the enemy was strong and we were weak; they demanded positional
warfare and so-called regular warfare, which relied solely on the
main forces; they demanded the strategy of a war of quick decision
and the tactics of protracted fighting; they demanded ³attack on all
fronts² and ³strike with two fists²; they opposed luring the enemy
in deep and regarded necessary shifts of troops as ³retreat and
flightism²; and they also demanded fixed battle lines and an absolutely
centralized command.  In brief, they negated guerrilla warfare and
mobile warfare of a guerrilla character and did not understand how
to conduct a people¹s war correctly.  During the campaign against the
fifth ³encirclement and suppression², the exponents of the third ³Left²
line began with adventurism in attack, urging that we ³engage the
enemy outside the gates²; then they turned to conservatism in de-
fence, calling for division of our forces to defend everything, for
³short, swift thrusts² and for ³a contest of attrition²; and they ended
with real flightism, when they were compelled to withdraw from
the Kiangsi base area.  Such were the consequences of their attempt
to substitute positional warfare for guerrilla and mobile warfare and
to substitute ³regular² warfare for a correctly conducted people¹s war.
	During the stages of strategic retreat and strategic stalemate in
the War of Resistance Against Japan, there has been an even greater
disparity between the enemy¹s strength and our own, and so the
correct principle for the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth
Army has been: ³Guerrilla warfare is basic, but lose no chance for
mobile warfare under favourable conditions.² It would have been
a mistake to press for too much mobile warfare.  But in the approach-
ing stage of strategic counter-offensive, just as the centre of gravity
in the work of the whole Party will have to be shifted from the
countryside to the cities, so in strategy it will be necessary to shift
from guerrilla warfare as primary to mobile and positional warfare

208 MAO TSE-TUNG 
as primary, provided our forces obtain modern equipment.  For this
impending change, too, the whole Party must make preparations with
full awareness.
	3.  Organizationally:
	As Comrade Mao Tse-tung says, the correct political line should be
³from the masses, to the masses².  To ensure that the line really comes
from the masses and in particular that it really goes back to the masses,
there must be close ties not only between the Party and the masses
outside the Party (between the class and the people), but above all
between the Party¹s leading bodies and the masses within the Party
(between the cadres and the rank and file); in other words, there
must be a correct organizational line.  Therefore, just as in each period
of the Party¹s history Comrade Mao Tse-tung has laid down a political
line representing the interests of the masses, so he has laid down
an organizational line serving the political line and maintaining ties
with the masses both inside and outside the Party.  There were im-
portant developments in this respect during the period of the Agrarian
Revolutionary War, which were crystallized in the resolution of the
Ninth Party Congress of the Fourth Red Army in 1929.40  This resolu-
tion raised Party-building to the plane of ideological and political
principle and firmly upheld the leading role of proletarian ideology;
it fought in a correct manner against the purely military viewpoint,
against subjectivism, individualism, equalitarianism, the roving-rebel
ideology, putschism and other tendencies; and it pointed out the roots
and harmfulness of these tendencies and the methods for correcting
them.  At the same time, the resolution firmly upheld strict democratic
centralism, opposing improper restrictions either on democracy or on
centralism.  Proceeding from the interests of the unity of the whole
Party, Comrade Mao Tse-tung insisted that the part should obey the
whole and, in accordance with the concrete characteristics of the
Chinese revolution, he defined the proper relationships between new
and old cadres, between outside and local cadres, between army
cadres and other cadres working in the locality and between cadres
of different departments or localities.  Thus Comrade Mao Tse-tung
provided us with a model of how to combine perseverance in truth
as a matter of principle with submission to organization as a matter
of discipline, a model of how to conduct inner-Party struggles in a
correct way while maintaining inner-Party unity in a correct way.
Conversely, whenever an erroneous political line became dominant,
an erroneous organizational line inevitably emerged, and the longer

209 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
the domination of the erroneous political line, the more the harm
done by its organizational line.  Accordingly, the various ³Left² lines
of the period of the Agrarian Revolutionary War were opposed to
Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s organizational line as well as to his political
line; they created a sectarianism which alienated the masses within
the Party (that is, which did not subordinate the partial interests of
some of the Party members to the interests of the whole Party and did
not regard the leading body of the Party as the concentrator of the will
of the whole Party) as well as one which alienated the masses outside
the Party (that is, which did not regard the Party as the representative
of the interests of the masses and the concentrator of their will).  In
particular, in order to enforce their will, the exponents of the third
³Left² line invariably and indiscriminately branded all Party comrades
who found the wrong line impracticable and who therefore expressed
doubt, disagreement or dissatisfaction, or did not actively support the
wrong line or firmly carry it out; they stigmatized these comrades with
such labels as ³Right opportunism², ³the rich peasant line², ³the Lo
Ming line², ³the line of conciliation² and ³double-dealing², waged
³ruthless struggles² against them and dealt them ³merciless blows²,
and even conducted these ³inner-Party struggles² as if they were deal-
ing with criminals and enemies.  This wrong kind of inner-Party struggle
became the regular method by which the comrades who led or carried
out the ³Left² line raised their own prestige, enforced their own
demands and intimidated the Party cadres.  It violated the funda-
mental principle of democratic centralism within the Party, eliminated
the democratic spirit of criticism and self-criticism, turned Party dis-
cipline into mechanical discipline and fostered tendencies to blind
obedience and docility; thus the development of living and creative
Marxism was hampered and damaged.  A factionalist policy towards
cadres was combined with this incorrect kind of inner-Party struggle.
The factionalists did not regard veteran cadres as valuable assets
of the Party; instead they attacked, punished and dismissed from the
central and local organizations large numbers of veteran cadres who
were experienced in work and had close ties with the masses but were
uncongenial to the factionalists and unwilling to be their blind followers
and yes-men.  Nor did they give proper education to new cadres nor
handle their promotion seriously (especially those of working-class
origin); instead they rashly promoted new cadres and cadres from
outside who lacked working experience and close ties with the masses
but were congenial to the factionalists and were merely their blind

210 MAO TSE-TUNG 
followers and yes-men, substituting them for veterans in the central
and local organizations.  Thus, they not only attacked old cadres
but spoiled new ones.  Moreover, in many places where an incorrect
policy for suppressing counter-revolutionaries became entangled with
the factionalist policy towards cadres, large numbers of fine comrades
were unjustly dealt with under false charges, and this caused the
Party most grievous losses.  Such factionalist errors very greatly
weakened the Party, causing dislocation between higher and lower
organizations and many other anomalies in the Party.
	This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session hereby declares: Any
penalty, or any part of a penalty, that was wrongly inflicted upon a
comrade by the exponents of the erroneous line shall be rescinded in
accordance with circumstances.  Every comrade who upon investiga-
tion is proved to have fallen victim to false charges shall be exonerated
and reinstated as a Party member, and his memory shall be held in
honour by all comrades.
	4.  Ideologically:
	The correctness or incorrectness of any political, military or or-
ganizational line has ideological roots  it depends on whether or
not the line starts from Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and
historical materialism and whether or not the line starts from the
objective realities of the Chinese revolution and the objective needs
of the Chinese people.  From the very day he embraced the cause
of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Tse-tung has devoted him-
self to applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the in-
vestigation and study of the actual conditions of Chinese society; time
and again during the period of the Agrarian Revolutionary War,
he laid great stress on the principle, ³No investigation, no right to
speak², and time and again fought against the dangers of dogmatism
and subjectivism.  Indeed, the political, military and organizational
lines then laid down by Comrade Mao Tse-tung were brilliant achieve-
ments which he made on the basis of the universal truth of Marxism-
Leninism, of dialectical and historical materialism, by his concrete
analysis of the actual situation and its characteristics inside and out-
side the country and inside and outside the Party and by his concrete
summing up of the historical experience of the Chinese revolution,
and especially of the 1924-27 revolution.  For Chinese Communists,
living and fighting in China, the purpose of studying dialectical
materialism and historical materialism should be to apply them to
the study and solution of the practical problems of the Chinese revolu-

211 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
tion, as Comrade Mao Tse-tung has done.  But, of course, none of the
comrades who committed ³Left² errors was then able to understand
or accept his method, and the exponents of the third ³Left² line even
slandered him as being a ³narrow empiricist².  The reason was that
their ideology was rooted in subjectivism and formalism, which during
the domination of the third ³Left² line expressed itself in a still more
pronounced form as dogmatism.  It is characteristic of dogmatism that
it starts not from actual conditions but from particular words and
phrases taken out of books.  The dogmatists did not base them-
selves on the Marxist-Leninist standpoint and method to make a
serious study of China¹s past and present  political, military, economic
and cultural  and of the practical experience of the Chinese revolu-
tion, to draw conclusions as a guide to action in the Chinese revolution
and to test the validity of these conclusions in the practice of the
masses.  On the contrary, throwing away the essence of Marxism-
Leninism, they transported particular words and phrases from Marxist-
Leninist literature into the country and took them for dogma, without
any study of the suitability of these quotations to the actual condi-
tions of present-day China.  Inevitably, therefore, the ³theories² of the
dogmatists were divorced from reality, their leadership was divorced
from the masses, and instead of seeking truth from facts they
were opinionated, arrogant, glib and afraid of proper criticism and
self-criticism.
	Empiricist ideology, which was the collaborator and assistant of
dogmatism in the period of its domination, is likewise a manifestation
of subjectivism and formalism.  Empiricism differs from dogmatism
in that it starts not from books but from narrow experience.  It should
be emphasized that all the useful experience gained by vast numbers
of comrades in practical work is a most precious asset.  It is definitely
not empiricism, but Marxism-Leninism, to sum up such experience
scientifically as the guide to future action, just as it is definitely not
dogmatism, but Marxism-Leninism, to take the theories and principles
of Marxism-Leninism as the guide to revolutionary action and not
as dogma.  But if there are some comrades among all those versed in
practical work who remain satisfied with their own limited experience
and with that alone, who take it for dogma that can be applied
everywhere, who do not understand and moreover do not want to
acknowledge the truth that ³without revolutionary theory there can
be no revolutionary movement²41 and that ³in order to lead, one must
foresee²,42 and who consequently belittle the study of Marxism-

212 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Leninism which is the summation of world revolutionary experience,
and are infatuated with a narrow practicalism which is devoid of
principle and with a brainless routinism that leads nowhere; and if
they nevertheless sit and give orders from on high, if in their purblind-
ness they style themselves heroes, put on the airs of veterans and
refuse to heed the criticism of comrades or to practise self-criticism 
then indeed these comrades have become empiricists.  Thus, in spite of
their different points of departure, the empiricists and the dogmatists
were essentially one in their method of thinking.  Both severed the
universal truth of Marxism-Leninism from the concrete practice of
the Chinese revolution; both violated dialectical and historical mate-
rialism and magnified partial and relative truths into universal and
absolute truths; and the thinking of neither corresponded to the
objective, actual situation as a whole.  Hence they shared many mis-
conceptions about Chinese society and the Chinese revolution (for
instance, their erroneous views about the cities as the centre of gravity,
about work in the White areas as the centre of gravity and their
erroneous views about ³regular² warfare, irrespective of actual con-
ditions).  Such were the ideological roots which made it possible for
these two different sets of comrades to collaborate.  On account of
their limited and narrow experience, most of the empiricists lacked
independent, clear-cut and systematic views on problems of a general
nature and therefore they usually played second fiddle in their as-
sociation with the dogmatists; but the history of our Party proves that
it would not have been easy for the dogmatists to have ³spread their
poison throughout the Party² without the collaboration of the em-
piricists; and after the defeat of dogmatism, empiricism became the
main obstacle to the development of Marxism-Leninism in the Party.
Hence we must overcome subjectivist empiricism as well as subjec-
tivist dogmatism.  Only by completely overcoming both dogmatist and
empiricist ideology can the Marxist-Leninist ideology, line and style
of work spread far and wide and take deep root in the whole Party.
	The errors discussed above in their four aspects, political, military,
organizational and ideological, were the fundamental errors of the
various ³Left² lines, and especially of the third.  And the political,
military and organizational errors all stemmed ideologically from the
violation of Marxist-Leninist dialectical and historical materialism,
from subjectivism and formalism, from dogmatism and empiricism.
	This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session points out that in negating
the errors of the various ³Left² lines we must bear in mind and carry

213 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
out Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s injunction, ³Treat all questions analyt-
ically; do not negate everything.²43 It should be noted that the com-
rades who made these errors were not wrong in all their views; some
of their views on fighting imperialism and feudalism, on the agrarian
revolution and on the war against Chiang Kai-shek were in agreement
with the views of the comrades who upheld the correct line.  It should
be further noted that, despite the especially long domination of the
third ³Left² line and the especially heavy losses it inflicted on the
Party and the revolution, the Party in the same period scored great
achievements in practical work in many areas and in many fields
(for example, in warfare, in building the army, in war mobilization,
in building political power and in the work in the White areas), thanks
to the active work and heroic struggles of vast numbers of cadres and
members, together with the masses of the soldiers and the people.  It
was precisely because of these achievements that over several years
we were able to sustain the war against the attacks of the enemy and to
hit him hard; and it was only because of the domination of the erroneous
line that these achievements were in the end destroyed.  The Party and
the people will for ever revere all the leaders, leading personnel and
cadres inside and outside the Party, all the members of the Party and
the masses who heroically sacrificed their lives in the interests of the
people during the domination of the various erroneous lines, just as
they revere those who sacrificed their lives in other periods of the
Party¹s history.


V

	The errors of the ³Left² line in the four aspects discussed above
were not accidental; they had very deep social roots.
	Just as the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Tse-tung
reflected the ideology of the advanced elements of the Chinese pro-
letariat, so the ³Left² line reflected the ideology of the Chinese petty-
bourgeois democrats.  Semi-colonial and semi-feudal China is a country
with an enormous petty bourgeoisie.  Not only is our Party surrounded
by this vast stratum; within the Party too, people of petty-bourgeois
origin make up most of the membership, the reason being that large
numbers of petty-bourgeois revolutionary democrats have turned to
the proletariat for a way out of their predicament, because in China
a strong petty-bourgeois political party has been rendered impossible

214 MAO TSE-TUNG 
by the great world victories of Marxism-Leninism following the
October Revolution, by the existing social and political conditions
in China, and especially by the historical development of the Kuo-
mintang and the Communist Party.  Moreover, in the economic con-
ditions of China, even the masses of workers and Party members of
working-class origin are liable to have a petty-bourgeois tinge.  It is
therefore not surprising but inevitable that petty-bourgeois ideology
should frequently be reflected inside our Party in every shape and form.
	Among the petty-bourgeois masses outside the Party, in addition
to the peasants who form the main force in the Chinese bourgeois-
democratic revolution, the urban petty bourgeoisie is also one of the
motive forces of the revolution in the present stage because the great
majority of its members are subjected to all kinds of oppression, are
being constantly and rapidly driven to poverty, bankruptcy and
unemployment, and very urgently demand economic and political
democracy.  But as a class in transition, the petty bourgeoisie has a dual
character.  As for its good and revolutionary side, the great majority
of this class are receptive to the political and organizational influence
of the proletariat and even to its ideological influence, at present they
demand a democratic revolution and are capable of uniting and fighting
for it, and in the future they can take the path of socialism together
with the proletariat; but as for its bad and backward side, not only
does this class have various weaknesses which distinguish it from
the proletariat, but when deprived of proletarian leadership, it often
veers and falls under the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie, or even
of the big bourgeoisie, and becomes their prisoner.  In the present
stage, therefore, the proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party
of China, should base themselves on a firm and broad alliance with the
masses of the petty bourgeoisie outside the Party, and should, on the
one hand, be lenient in dealing with them and tolerate their liberal
ideas and style of work, insofar as these do not impede the struggle
against the enemy or disrupt the social life we share in common and,
on the other, give them appropriate education so as to strengthen our
alliance with them.
	But the case is entirely different with those people of petty-
bourgeois origin who have voluntarily abandoned their original class
stand and joined the party of the proletariat.  The Party should adopt
a policy towards them that differs in principle from that towards the
petty-bourgeois masses outside the Party.  Since such people were close
to the proletariat to begin with and joined its party voluntarily, they

215 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
can gradually become proletarian in their ideology through Marxist-
Leninist education in the Party and steeling in mass revolutionary
struggles, and they can be of great service to the proletarian forces.
In fact, the overwhelming majority of the people of petty-bourgeois
origin who have joined our Party have fought bravely, made sacrifices
for the Party and the people and progressed ideologically, and many
of them have already become Marxist-Leninists.  It has to be em-
phasized, however, that the revolutionary character of the petty
bourgeois who has not yet been proletarianized is essentially different
from the revolutionary character of the proletarian, and that this dif-
ference can often develop into a state of antagonism.  Party members
with a petty-bourgeois revolutionary character have joined the Party
organizationally, but they have not yet joined the Party ideologically,
or have not done so fully, and they are often liberals, reformists,
anarchists, Blanquists,44 etc.  in the guise of Marxist-Leninists.  Such
being the case, not only are they incapable of leading to victory China¹s
communist movement of tomorrow, but they cannot even lead to
victory her new-democratic movement of today.  If the advanced
elements of the proletariat do not draw a firm and sharp line between
Marxist-Leninist ideology and the original ideology of those Party
members who came from the petty bourgeoisie and do not educate
them and struggle with them in a serious but appropriate and patient
way, it will be impossible to overcome their petty-bourgeois ideology,
and what is more, these members will inevitably strive to remould
the vanguard of the proletariat in their own image and usurp Party
leadership, thus damaging the cause of the Party and the people.  The
more numerous the petty bourgeoisie outside the Party and the more
numerous the members of petty-bourgeois origin inside the Party, the
more strictly must the Party preserve its purity as the vanguard of the
proletariat; failing this, petty-bourgeois ideology will assail the Party
the more violently and the damage will be the greater.  In the history
of our Party, the struggles between the correct line and the various
erroneous lines have been in essence the acting out within the Party
of the class struggle outside it, and the political, military, organiza-
tional and ideological errors of the ³Left² lines discussed above have
been reflections in the Party of precisely this petty-bourgeois ideology.
This question may be analysed from three aspects.
	First, the method of thinking.  The petty-bourgeois method of
thinking manifests itself basically in subjectivism and one-sidedness in
viewing problems, that is, it does not proceed from an objective and

216 MAO TSE-TUNG 
comprehensive picture of the balance of class forces, but takes subjec-
tive wishes, impressions and empty talk for reality, takes a single
aspect for all aspects, the part for the whole and the tree for the forest.
Being detached from the actual process of production, petty-bourgeois
intellectuals have only book knowledge and lack perceptual knowl-
edge, and so their method of thinking is apt to manifest itself in
the dogmatism discussed above.  Though they have some perceptual
knowledge, those petty-bourgeois elements associated with production
suffer from the limitations characteristic of petty production  nar-
rowness, diffuseness, isolation and conservatism  and so their method
of thinking is apt to manifest itself in the empiricism discussed above.
	Second, political tendency.  The political tendency of the petty
bourgeoisie is apt to manifest itself in vacillation between the ³Left²
and the Right because of its mode of life and the resulting subjectivism
and one-sidedness of its method of thinking.  Many representatives of
the petty-bourgeois revolutionaries hope for an immediate victory of
the revolution in order to bring about a radical change in their present
status; therefore, they lack the patience needed for protracted revo-
lutionary endeavour, are fond of ³Left² revolutionary phrases and
slogans and, in their sentiments and actions, are given to closed-
doorism or adventurism.  Reflected in the Party, this petty-bourgeois
tendency gave rise to the various errors of the ³Left² line on the
questions discussed above, namely, the tasks of the revolution, the
revolutionary base areas, the direction of tactics and the military line.
	But the same petty-bourgeois revolutionaries when placed in a
different set of circumstances  or another section of the petty-
bourgeois revolutionaries  may become pessimistic and despondent
and express Rightist sentiments and views, tailing after the bourgeoisie.
The Chen Tu-hsiuism of the latter period of the 1924-27 revolution,
the Chang Kuo-taoism of the latter period of the Agrarian Revolution
and the flightism of the early period of the Long March were all
reflections within the Party of such petty-bourgeois Rightist ideology.
And during the War of Resistance Against Japan, capitulationist ideas
appeared once again.  Generally speaking, ³Left² errors are more liable
to occur in periods when there is a split between the bourgeoisie and
the proletariat (for instance, the ³Left² line dominated the leading
body of the Party no less than three times during the period of the
Agrarian Revolution), while Rightist errors are more liable to occur
in periods when there is an alliance between the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat (for instance, in the latter part of the 1924-27 revolution and

217 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
in the early part of the War of Resistance Against Japan).  But whether
³Left² or Right, these tendencies benefit not the revolution but only
the counter-revolution.  Vacillation to the ³Left² or to the Right, the
fondness for going to extremes, flashiness without substance and slick
opportunism, all of which occur under the stress of changing condi-
tions, are features of the bad side of petty-bourgeois ideology.  They
are all reflections in the ideological sphere of the unstable economic
status of the petty bourgeoisie.
	Third, organizational life.  Because of the limitations in the way
of life and the method of thinking of the petty bourgeoisie in general,
and particularly because of China¹s backward and decentralized social
environment with its clans and guilds, the tendency of the petty bour-
geoisie in organizational life is apt to manifest itself in individualism
and sectarianism, which alienate the masses.  This tendency, when
reflected in the Party, led to the erroneous, ³Left² organizational line,
which was discussed above.  The fact that the Party had for a long
time been fighting a scattered guerrilla war in the countryside made
it still easier for this tendency to grow.  This tendency consisted not
of working selflessly for the Party and the people, but of exploiting
the strength of the Party and the people and undermining their interests
for personal or sectarian ends; it was therefore incompatible with the
Party¹s principle of close links with the masses, incompatible with the
democratic centralism of the Party and with Party discipline.  This
tendency frequently took such forms as bureaucracy, patriarchalism,
punitiveness, commandism, individualistic heroism, semi-anarchism,
liberalism, ultra-democracy, assertion of ³independence², the guild
mentality, the ³mountain-stronghold² mentality,45 favouritism towards
fellow-townsmen and schoolmates, factional squabbles and rascally
tricks, all of which undermine the Party¹s ties with the masses and its
internal unity.
	These are the three aspects of petty-bourgeois ideology.  The sub-
jectivism in ideology, the ³Left² and Right deviations in politics and
the sectarianism in organization, which have all appeared on various
occasions in our Party, are obviously anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-
proletarian manifestations of petty-bourgeois ideology, whether or not
they crystallize into a line and gain control of the Party leadership.
In the interests of the Party and the people, it is absolutely necessary
to use the method of education to analyse and overcome petty-
bourgeois ideology within the Party, and to help transform it into
proletarian ideology.

218 MAO TSE-TUNG 
VI

	It can be seen from the above that the various ³Left² lines, and
especially the third ³Left² line, which dominated the whole Party,
were not accidental but were the products of specific social and his-
torical conditions.  Hence if we are to overcome erroneous ³Left² or
Right ideology, we cannot go about it either casually or impetuously,
but must deepen Marxist-Leninist education and raise the ability of
the whole Party to differentiate between proletarian and petty-
bourgeois ideology; we must give full play to inner-Party democracy,
develop criticism and self-criticism, proceed with the work of patient
persuasion and education, make a concrete analysis of errors and their
dangers and explain their historical and ideological roots as well as
the means of correcting them.  Such is the proper attitude for Marxist-
Leninists in overcoming errors within the Party.  This Enlarged Seventh
Plenary Session points out that the policy Comrade Mao Tse-tung has
adopted for the present rectification movement throughout the Party
and for the study of Party history, namely, ³learn from past mistakes
to avoid future ones and cure the sickness to save the patient², and
achieve ³clarity in ideology and unity among comrades²,46 is a model
of the correct attitude for Marxist-Leninists in overcoming errors
within the Party.  Therefore it has led to great achievements in uniting
and raising the level of the whole Party ideologically, politically and
organizationally.
	This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session points out that the strug-
gles which the Party waged in the course of its history against Chen
Tu-hsiuism and Li Li-sanism were absolutely necessary.  The defect in
these struggles was that they were not undertaken consciously as
serious steps for correcting the petty-bourgeois ideology which existed
on a serious scale in the Party; consequently they neither clarified the
ideological essence and roots of the errors thoroughly nor properly
indicated the methods of correcting them, and so it was easy for these
errors to recur.  Moreover, undue stress was placed on personal re-
sponsibility in the belief that once an erring comrade was attacked, the
problem was solved.  Having examined the errors committed during
and after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee,
the Party considers that such defects must be avoided in all future
inner-Party ideological struggles and that Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s
policy must be resolutely applied.  So long as any comrade who has

219 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
erred in the past understands his errors and has begun to correct
them, we should welcome him without prejudice and unite with him
to work for the Party.  We should take a sincere and comradely attitude
even towards those comrades who have not yet properly understood
and corrected their errors but who no longer persist in them, and we
should help them to realize and correct these errors.  The whole Party
is now unanimous in its understanding of the erroneous lines of the
past.  The whole Party has rallied round the Central Committee headed
by Comrade Mao Tse-tung.  Therefore, the task of the entire Party
from now on is to strengthen unity by clarifying thinking and holding
fast to principle, or, in the words of the second section of this Resolu-
tion, to ³unite the whole Party like one harmonious family, like solid
steel, to fight for total victory in the War of Resistance Against
Japan and for the complete liberation of the Chinese people².  All
our Party¹s analyses, criticisms and controversies concerning ques-
tions of Party history should start from the desire for unity and arrive
at unity; any violation of this principle is wrong.  Since petty-bourgeois
ideology in the Party has its social roots and the Party has long been
placed in an environment of protracted and scattered guerrilla war-
fare in the countryside, since ideological remnants of dogmatism and
empiricism still exist and the criticism of empiricism in particular has
been inadequate, and since the ³mountain-stronghold² mentality with
its sectarian tendencies is still quite widespread although serious
sectarianism has been mainly overcome in the Party, the whole Party
should be alert to the fact that a long process of continuous struggle
to overcome wrong ideas is required if the Party is to achieve
complete Marxist-Leninist ideological unity.  This Enlarged Seventh
Plenary Session therefore resolves that the whole Party must strengthen
its Marxist-Leninist ideological education and stress the linking of
Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, so as
further to develop a correct Party style of work and completely over-
come such tendencies as dogmatism, empiricism, sectarianism and the
³mountain-stronghold² mentality.


VII

	This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session emphatically declares that
the practice of the Chinese revolution during the last twenty-four
years has proved, and continues to prove, that the line represented

220 MAO TSE-TUNG 
by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the line of struggle of our Party and of
the people of the whole country, is entirely correct.  The great successes
achieved by our Party in the present War of Resistance and the deci-
sive role our Party has played testify most vividly to the correctness
of this line.  When viewed in relation to the Chinese revolution as a
whole with its stormy development, great achievements and rich
experience in the past twenty-four years under the leadership of our
Party, the ³Left² and Right errors in the Party during certain periods
were only partial phenomena.  It was difficult to avoid such phenomena
completely at a time when the Party lacked adequate experience and
political consciousness.  Furthermore, it has been precisely through the
struggle to overcome these errors that the Party has grown firmer and
stronger.  Today, with unprecedented unanimity the whole Party
recognizes the correctness of Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s line and with
unprecedented political consciousness rallies under his banner.  As
Marxist-Leninist ideology, which Comrade Mao Tse-tung represents,
more and more profoundly grips more and more of the cadres, the
Party members and the masses of the people, the result will surely be
tremendous progress and invincible strength for the Party and the
Chinese revolution.
	This Enlarged Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Com-
mittee is firmly convinced that under the correct leadership of the
Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the Commu-
nist Party of China, with the rich experience of the three revolutionary
struggles  the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolutionary War
and the War of Resistance Against Japan  will assuredly lead the
Chinese revolution to complete victory.

NOTES

	1	In 1924, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in alliance with the Communist Party and the
revolutionary workers and peasants, defeated the ³Merchants¹ Corps², an armed
force of the compradors and landlords which engaged in counter-revolutionary
activities in Canton in collaboration with the British imperialists.  The revolutionary
army, which had been founded on the basis of co-operation between the Kuomintang
and the Communist Party, set out from Canton early in 1925, fought the Eastern Cam-
paign and, with the support of the peasants, defeated the troops of the warlord Chen
Chiung-ming.  It then returned to Canton and overthrew the Yunnan and Kwangsi
warlords who had entrenched themselves there.  That autumn it conducted the Second
Eastern Campaign and finally wiped out Chen Chiung-ming¹s forces.  These cam-

221 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
paigns, in which members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League
fought heroically in the van, brought about the political unification of Kwangtung
Province and paved the way for the Northern Expedition.

	2	Lo Chang-lung, an early member of the Chinese Communist Party, later turned
traitor to the revolution.  At the time of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central
Committee of the Party in 1931, Lo Chang-lung, who was pessimistic about the future
of the Chinese revolution, openly supported the counter-revolutionary stand of the
Trotskyist Chen Tu-hsiu clique in opposition to the line of the Sixth National Congress
of the Party, vilified the Red Army and the Red base areas, and distributed leaflets
in which he betrayed the names of Communist cadres to Chiang Kai-shek¹s gang.
To undermine the revolutionary struggle led by the Party, he set up the so-called
³Emergency Central Committee², ³Second Provincial Committees², ³Second Regional
Committees² and ³Second Party Fractions in Trade Unions² and carried out split-
ting activities in the Party.  He was expelled from the Party in January 1931.

of this volume.

	4	After the failure of the Chinese revolution in 1927, a small number of Trotskyites
appeared in China, too.  Ganging up with Chen Tu-hsiu and other renegades, they
formed a small counter-revolutionary clique in 1929 and spread such counter-revolu-
tionary propaganda as that the Kuomintang had already completed the bourgeois-
democratic revolution, and they became a dirty imperialist and Kuomintang instrument
against the people.  The Chinese Trotskyites shamelessly joined the Kuomintang secret
service.  After the September 18th Incident, to fulfil the order given by the criminal
renegade Trotsky ³not to impede the occupation of China by imperial Japan², they
began collaborating with the Japanese secret agents, received subsidies from them
and engaged in all kinds of activities facilitating Japanese aggression.

	6	The First Front Army of the Red Army launched its second offensive against
Changsha, capital of Hunan Province, in September 1930.  As the enemy forces put
up a stubborn defence behind fortifications and had the support of aircraft and
warships, the Red Army failed to capture the city even after prolonged attacks.
Meanwhile, enemy reinforcements were concentrating and the situation became
unfavourable for the Red Army.  Comrade Mao Tse-tung impressed upon the cadres
of the First Front Army the need to withdraw the troops besieging Changsha, and
then persuaded them to give up their idea of seizing the key city of Kiukiang in
northern Kiangsi and attacking other big cities and to change their policy, divide
their forces and capture Chaling, Yuhsien and Liling Counties in Hunan and
Pinghsiang and Kian Counties in Kiangsi.  This enabled the First Front Army to
expand greatly.

	7	Comrade Chu Chiu-pai, one of the earliest members and leaders of the Chinese
Communist Party, was elected to the Central Committee at the Third, Fourth, Fifth
and Sixth National Congresses of the Party in the years 1923-28.  During the First
Revolutionary Civil War he actively fought against the anti-Communist, anti-popular
³Tai Chi-tao doctrine² of the Kuomintang¹s right-wing and against the Right oppor-
tunism represented by Chen Tu-hsiu in the Chinese Communist Party.  After the
Kuomintang¹s betrayal of the revolution in 1927, he called the emergency meeting
of the Central Committee of the Party on August 7, which ended the domination of
Chen Tu-hsiuism in the Party.  But from the winter of 1927 to the spring of 1928, while
directing the work of the central leading body, he committed the ³Left² error of

222 MAO TSE-TUNG 
putschism.  In September 1930 he conducted the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth
Central Committee of the Party, which put an end to the Li Li-san line that was
harming the Party.  However, at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central
Committee in January 1931, he was attacked by the ³Left² dogmatists and factionalists
and was pushed out of the central leading body.  From that time to 1933 he worked in
the revolutionary cultural movement in Shanghai in co-operation with Lu Hsun.  In
1933 he arrived in the Red base area in Kiangsi and was made Commissioner of
People¹s Education in the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Democratic Central Government.
When the main forces of the Red Army embarked on the Long March, he was asked
to stay behind in the Kiangsi base area.  In March 1935 Comrade Chu Chiu-pai was
arrested by the Chiang Kai-shek gang in the Fukien guerrilla area and on June 18 he
died a martyr¹s death in Changting, Fukien Province.

	8	Comrade Lin Yu-nan, a member of the Chinese Communist Party and one of
the early leaders and organizers of the Chinese trade union movement, was Director
of the Wuhan office of the Chinese Trade Union Secretariat, a member of the
Executive Committee and concurrently Secretary-General of the All-China Federation
of Trade Unions.  In 1931 he was arrested by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and died a
martyr¹s death at Lunghua in Shanghai.

	9	Comrade Li Chiu-shih, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, served in
1928 on the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League and was
head of its Propaganda Department and chief editor of its organ, Chinese Youth
In 1931, while working in the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of
the Party, he was arrested by the Chiang Kai-shek gang in Shanghai and died a
martyr¹s death at Lunghua.

	10	Comrade Ho Meng-hsiung, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, was
one of the early organizers of the trade union movement in northern China and
founder of the Railway Workers¹ Union on the Peking-Suiyuan Line.  After the Kuo-
mintang betrayed the revolution in 1927, he served as a member of the Communist
Party¹s Kiangsu Provincial Committee in Shanghai and as secretary of its Peasant
Department.  In 1931 he was arrested by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and died a martyr¹s
death at Lunghua.

	11	Comrade Chin Pang-hsien, also known as Po Ku, was a member of the
Chinese Communist Party.  From September 1931 to January 1935 he was at the head
first of the Party¹s provisional central leadership in Shanghai and then of its Central
Bureau of the Red Base Areas.  During this period he committed the serious error of
the ³Left² line.  He worked in the Southern Bureau of the Party¹s Central Committee
during the early period of the War of Resistance Against Japan.  After 1941, under
the leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, he founded and directed the Liberation
Daily and the Hsinhua News Agency in Yenan.  He was re-elected to the Central
Committee at the Seventh National Congress of the Party in 1945.  In February 1946
he went to Chungking to take part in the negotiations with the Kuomintang.  He died
in April in an aeroplane crash on his way back to Yenan.

	12	Comrade Chu Li-chih, who committed ³Left² errors, arrived in the autumn
of 1935 in the northern Shensi revolutionary base area (comprising the Shensi-Kansu
border area and northern Shensi) as a representative of the central leading body.  In
collaboration with Comrade Kuo Hung-tao, who was there and who also committed
³Left² errors, he carried through the ³Left² opportunist line in political, military and
organizational work, and they pushed out Liu Chih-tan and the other comrades who
had pursued the correct line and had built up the Red Army and the revolutionary
base area in northern Shensi.  Then, in the work of suppressing counter-revolu-

223 APPENDIX :  RESOLUTION  ON  QUESTIONS  IN  PARTY  HISTORY
tionaries, they made the serious error of arresting a large number of cadres who
were carrying out the correct line, and thus created a grave crisis in the northern
Shensi revolutionary base area.  The central leadership of the Party, which arrived
in northern Shensi in November 1935 after the Long March, corrected these ³Left²
errors, released Liu Chih-tan and the other comrades from prison, and thus saved
the northern Shensi revolutionary base area from its dangerous situation.

	18	In January 1933, the Communist Party of China made a declaration proposing
to all Kuomintang troops attacking the revolutionary base areas and the Red Army
that a cease-fire agreement be concluded and joint resistance conducted against Japan
on three conditions: (1) stop attacking the revolutionary base areas and the Red
Army; (2) grant freedoms and rights to the people; and (3) arm the people.

	19	The six conditions were those contained in the ³Chinese People¹s Basic Pro-
gramme for Fighting Japan² put forward by the Chinese Communist Party in
1934 and published over the signatures of Soong Ching Ling (Mme. Sun Yat-sen)
and others.  They were: (1) mobilize all sea, land and air forces to fight Japan;
(2) mobilize the people throughout the country; (3) arm all the people; (4) con-
fiscate the property of the Japanese imperialists in China and of the traitors to
defray war expenditure; (5) establish an all-China committee for national armed
defence, to be elected by the representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, students
and businessmen; and (6) form an alliance with all the forces opposed to the
Japanese imperialists, and establish friendly relations with all countries observing
benevolent neutrality.

	35	Lo Ming, formerly a member of the Chinese Communist Party, was the

confronted with a rather difficult situation in Shanghang, Yungting and other outlying
parts of western Fukien, its policy there should be different from that in the stable
base areas.  The ³Leftists² wrongly and exaggeratedly represented his views as

about the revolution², and, organizationally, waged the so-called ³struggle against

People¹s Liberation Army.  As these rules varied slightly in content in the army
units of different areas, the General Headquarters of the Chinese People¹s Liberation
Army in October 1947 issued a standard version as follows:
	The Three Main Rules of Discipline:
		(1) Obey orders in all your actions.
		(2) Do not take a single needle or piece of thread from the masses.
		(3) Turn in everything captured.
	The Eight Points for Attention:
		(1) Speak politely.

SERVE THE PEOPLE 
September 1945 
Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route and New Fourth 
Armies led by our Party are battalions of the revolution. These 
battalions of ours are wholly dedicated to the liberation of the people 
and work entirely in the people¹s interests. Comrade Chang Szu-teh1 
was in the ranks of these battalions. 
All men must die, but death can vary in its significance. The 
ancient Chinese writer Szuma Chien said, ³Though death befalls all 
men alike, it may be weightier than Mount Tai or lighter than a 
feather.²2 To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to 
work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter 
than a feather. Comrade Chang Szu-teh died for the people, and his 
death is indeed weightier than Mount Tai. 
If we have shortcomings, we are not afraid to have them pointed 
out and criticized, because we serve the people. Anyone, no matter 
who, may point out our shortcomings. If he is right, we will correct 
them. If what he proposes will benefit the people, we will act upon it. 
The idea of ³better troops and simpler administration² was put forward 
by Mr. Li Ting-ming,3 who is not a Communist. He made a good 
suggestion which is of benefit to the people, and we have adopted it. 
If, in the interests of the people, we persist in doing what is right and 
correct what is wrong, our ranks will surely thrive. 
We hail from all corners of the country and have joined together 
for a common revolutionary objective. And we need the vast majority 
of the people with us on the road to this objective. Today, we already 
lead base areas with a population of 91 million,4 but this is not enough; 
to liberate the whole nation more are needed. In times of difficulty 
This speech was delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at a memorial meeting 
for Comrade Chang Szu-teh, held by departments directly under the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China.
227

228 MAO TSE-TUNG 
we must not lose sight of our achievements, must see the bright future 
and must pluck up our courage. The Chinese people are suffering; 
it is our duty to save them and we must exert ourselves in struggle. 
Wherever there is struggle there is sacrifice, and death is a common 
occurrence. But we have the interests of the people and the sufferings 
of the great majority at heart, and when we die for the people it 
is a worthy death. Nevertheless, we should do our best to avoid unnecessary 
sacrifices. Our cadres must show concern for every soldier, 
and all people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, 
must love and help each other. 
From now on, when anyone in our ranks who has done some 
useful work dies, be he soldier or cook, we should have a funeral 
ceremony and a memorial meeting in his honour. This should become 
the rule. And it should be introduced among the people as well. 
When someone dies in a village, let a memorial meeting be held. In 
this way we express our mourning for the dead and unite all the people. 
NOTES 
1 Comrade Chang Szu-teh was a soldier in the Guards Regiment of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. A member of Communist Party who 
loyally served the interests of the people, he joined the revolution in 1933, took 
part in the Long March and was wounded in service. On September 5, 1944, when 
making charcoal in the mountains of Ansai County, northern Shensi, he was killed 
by the sudden collapse of a kiln. 
2 Szuma Chien, the famous Chinese historian of the 2nd century B.C., was the 
author of the Historical Records. The quotation comes from his ³Reply to Jen 
Shao-ching¹s Letter². 
3 Li Ting-ming, an enlightened landlord of northern Shensi Province, was 
at one time elected Vice-Chairman of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region 
Government.

and all other Liberated Areas in northern, central and southern China.

ON CHIANG KAI-SHEK¹S SPEECH 
ON THE DOUBLE TENTH FESTIVAL 
October 11, 1945 
One of the distinguishing features of Chiang Kai-shek¹s Double 
Tenth1 speech is its utter lack of content and its failure to answer 
any of the questions about which the people are deeply concerned. 
Chiang Kai-shek declares that the enemy is not to be feared because 
there are still vast territories in the Great Rear Area. So far the 
autocratic Kuomintang leaders have shown neither the desire nor 
the ability to introduce political reforms or keep the enemy at bay, 
and territory is the only ³capital² they can fall back upon for resisting 
the enemy. But it is plain to all that without a correct policy and without 
human effort this capital is not enough, for Japanese imperialism 
is daily threatening the remaining territories. In all probability Chiang 
Kai-shek has acutely felt this threat, as is shown by the very fact 
that he is repeatedly assuring the people that no such threat exists and 
even says, ³In the twenty years since I founded the army at the 
Whampoa Military Academy,2 the revolutionary situation has never 
been so stable as at present.² He also keeps repeating, ³We must not 
lose our self-confidence,² which actually indicates loss of confidence 
among many people within the ranks of the Kuomintang and among 
many prominent public figures in the Kuomintang areas. Chiang 
Kai-shek has been casting about for some means to restore that confidence. 
But instead of looking for such means by examining his policy 
and work in the political, military, economic and cultural fields, he 
resorts to the rejection of criticisms and the whitewashing of his mistakes. 
He says that all ³foreign observers² are ³ignorant of the heart 
of the matter² and that the ³babel of foreign criticism of our military 
and political affairs² is entirely due to credulous acceptance of ³the 
rumours and tricks of the invaders and the Chinese collaborators². 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote this commentary for the Hsinhua News Agency. 
229

230 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Curiously enough, such foreigners as Franklin D. Roosevelt as well as 
such Kuomintang members as Soong Ching Ling, many members 
of the People¹s Political Council, and all Chinese who are not 
devoid of conscience, disbelieve the plausible explanations offered 
by Chiang Kai-shek and his trusted followers and are also raising 
a ³babel of criticism of our military and political affairs². Chiang 
Kai-shek is annoyed, but not until this year¹s Double Tenth Festival 
did he succeed in discovering what he regards as a compelling 
argument, i.e., that these people believe ³the rumours and tricks of 
the invaders and the Chinese collaborators². So in his speech Chiang 
Kai-shek vehemently denounces these ³rumours and tricks of the 
invaders and the Chinese collaborators² at great length. He fancies 
that, having made this denunciation, he can silence all the Chinese 
and foreigners. And anyone who again raises a ³babel of criticism² 
of his military and political affairs will be put down as a willing 
believer of ³the rumours and tricks of the invaders and the Chinese 
collaborators²! We consider Chiang Kai-shek¹s accusations ridiculous 
in the extreme. For the invaders and the Chinese collaborators have 
never criticized, but on the contrary have warmly applauded, the 
Kuomintang for its autocracy, its half-hearted prosecution of the war, 
its corruption and incompetence, and the fascist decrees and defeatist 
military orders of its government. Chiang Kai-shek¹s China¹s Destiny, 
a book which has met with general disapproval, has won sincere and 
repeated praise from the Japanese imperialists. The invaders and the 
Chinese collaborators have never said a word about reorganization 
of the National Government and its supreme command, because it is 
their cherished wish that this government and supreme command 
which keep on oppressing the people and losing battles will be preserved. 
Is it not a fact that Chiang Kai-shek and his group have always 
been the target of Japanese inducements to surrender? Is it not also a 
fact that of the two slogans originally put forward by the Japanese 
imperialists, one, ³Annihilate the Kuomintang!² has been dropped 
long ago and only the other, ³Oppose the Communists!² remains? 
To this very moment the Japanese imperialists have not declared war 
on the Kuomintang government, and no state of war, so they say, 
exists between Japan and the Kuomintang government! To this very 
moment the invaders and the Chinese collaborators are taking good 
care of the property of the Kuomintang bigwigs in Shanghai, Nanking, 
Ningpo, etc. The enemy chieftain Shunroku Hata has sent his representatives 
to offer sacrifices at Chiang Kai-shek¹s ancestral tombs at

231 ON CHIANG¹S SPEECH ON DOUBLE TENTH FESTIVAL 
Fenghua. In Shanghai and elsewhere, emissaries secretly dispatched by 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s trusted followers are maintaining almost uninterrupted 
contact and carrying on clandestine negotiations with the 
Japanese invaders. These contacts and negotiations become more 
frequent whenever the Japanese intensify their offensives. Aren¹t all 
these things facts? Are those who raise a ³babel of criticism² of the 
military and political affairs of Chiang Kai-shek and his group really 
³ignorant of the heart of the matter², or are they on the contrary only 
too well acquainted with it? After all, where is ³the heart of the 
matter² to be found, in ³the rumours and tricks of the invaders and 
the Chinese collaborators², or in Chiang Kai-shek himself and his 
own group? 
In another statement in his speech, Chiang Kai-shek denies that 
civil war will break out in China. But he adds, ³Certainly no one will 
ever again dare to rebel against the Republic and sabotage the War 
of Resistance, as Wang Ching-wei and his like have done.² Here 
Chiang Kai-shek is seeking, and has in fact found, an excuse for civil 
war. Any Chinese whose memory is not too short will remember that 
in 1941, at the very moment when the betrayers of China were ordering 
the disbandment of the New Fourth Army and the Chinese people 
were rising to avert the crisis of civil war, Chiang Kai-shek made a 
speech in which he said that there would never be any war to ³suppress 
the Communists² and that, should there be a war, it would only 
be a punitive one to put down rebels. Those who have read China¹s 
Destiny will also remember Chiang Kai-shek¹s remark that the Communist 
Party of China was ³in league with² Wang Ching-wei in 1927 
during the period of the Wuhan Government. In the resolutions of 
the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive 
Committee in 1943, an eight-word label was attached to the Chinese 
Communist Party: ³Sabotaging the War of Resistance and endangering 
the state.² After reading his present speech, one feels that the danger 
of civil war not only exists but is actually growing. From now on the 
Chinese people should firmly bear in mind that one fine morning 
Chiang Kai-shek will order a punitive expedition against so-called 
rebels and that the charge will be ³rebellion against the Republic², 
³sabotaging the War of Resistance², and doing what ³Wang Ching-wei 
and his like have done². Chiang is good at playing this game; he is 
no good at denouncing as rebels people like Pang Ping-hsun, Sun 
Liang-cheng and Chen Hsiao-chiang3 or at launching punitive expeditions 
against them, but he is very good at denouncing as ³rebels² the

232 MAO TSE-TUNG 
New Fourth Army in central China and the Dare-to-Die Corps4 in 
Shansi and is exceptionally good at launching punitive expeditions 
against them. The Chinese people must not forget that, while proclaiming 
that he will not fight a civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has already 
dispatched 775,000 troops who are now engaged exclusively in encircling 
or attacking the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army 
and the people¹s guerrillas in southern China. 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s speech has nothing to show on the positive side, 
and he has in no way met the Chinese people¹s eager desire to strengthen 
the anti-Japanese front. On the negative side, the speech is fraught 
with dangerous possibilities. His attitude is becoming more and more 
anomalous, as witness his stubborn opposition to the people¹s demand 
for political change, his bitter hatred of the Chinese Communist Party 
and his hint at a pretext for the anti-Communist civil war he is preparing. 
However, he will succeed in none of his schemes. Unless he is 
willing to mend his ways, he will be lifting a rock only to drop it on 
his own toes. We sincerely hope he will change his ways, because his 
present course of action will get him absolutely nowhere. Since he has 
proclaimed that ³a greater latitude will be allowed to the voicing of 
opinions²,5 he should not stifle the ³babel of criticism² by threatening 
people with the slander that they are willingly accepting ³the rumours 
and tricks of the invaders and the Chinese collaborators². Since he 
has proclaimed that ³the period of political tutelage will be shortened², 
he should not reject the demand for reorganizing the government and 
the supreme command. Since he has proclaimed that ³the Communist 
problem should be solved politically², he should not again seek 
a pretext for preparing civil war. 
NOTES 
1 The Double Tenth, October 10, is the anniversary of the armed uprising in 
Wuhan which set off the Revolution of 1911. 
2 The Whampoa Military Academy, located at Whampoa near Canton, was 
established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924 after the reorganization of the Kuomintang 
with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Union. Before Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s betrayal of the revolution in 1927, the academy was run jointly by the 
Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Comrades Chou En-lai, Yeh Chien-ying, 
Yun Tai-ying, Hsiao Chu-nu and others held responsible posts in the academy at 
one time or another. Many of the cadets were members of the Communist Party

233 ON CHIANG¹S SPEECH ON DOUBLE TENTH FESTIVAL 
or the Communist Youth League, and they formed the revolutionary core of 
the academy. 
3 Pang Ping-hsun, Sun Liang-cheng and Chen Hsiao-chiang were Kuomintang 
generals who openly deserted to the Japanese invaders. 
4 The Dare-to-Die Corps in Shansi was an anti-Japanese armed force of the 
people which developed under the leadership and influence of the Communist Party 
in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
5 In April 1944 the Kuomintang announced that ³a greater latitude will be allowed 
to the voicing of opinions². Its purpose was to fob off the people, because the demand 
that the Kuomintang dictatorship should be ended, democracy established, and freedom 
of speech guaranteed had become the general cry of the people in the Kuomintang 
areas from the beginning of the year. In May, the Twelfth Plenary Session 
of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang again declared that it would 
³protect freedom of speech². But the Kuomintang never fulfilled any of the promises 
it had been compelled to make, and as the people¹s movement for democracy 
surged forward, it multiplied its measures for the suppression of popular opinion.


THE UNITED FRONT IN 
CULTURAL WORK 
October 30, 1944
The purpose of all our work is the overthrow of Japanese imperialism. 
Like Hitler, Japanese imperialism is approaching its doom. 
But we must continue our efforts, for only so can we achieve its final 
overthrow. In our work the war comes first, then production, then 
cultural work. An army without culture is a dull-witted army, and a 
dull-witted army cannot defeat the enemy. 
The culture of the Liberated Areas already has its progressive side, 
but it still has a backward side. The Liberated Areas already have a 
new culture, a people¹s culture, but a good many vestiges of feudalism 
survive. Among the 1,500,000 people of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia 
Border Region there are more than 1,000,000 illiterates, there are 
2,000 practitioners of witchcraft, and the broad masses are still 
under the influence of superstition. These are enemies inside the 
minds of the people. It is often more difficult to combat the enemies 
inside people¹s minds than to fight Japanese imperialism. We must 
call on the masses to arise in struggle against their own illiteracy, 
superstitions and unhygienic habits. For this struggle a broad united 
front is indispensable. And this united front has to be particularly 
broad in a place like the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, which 
has a sparse population, poor communications and a low cultural base 
to start from and in addition is fighting a war. Hence, in our education 
we must have not only regular primary and secondary schools but 
also scattered, irregular village schools, newspaper-reading groups and 
literacy classes. Not only must we have schools of the modern type 
but we must also utilize and transform the old-style village schools. 
This speech was delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at a conference of cultural 
and educational workers of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
235

236 MAO TSE-TUNG 
In the arts, we must have not only modern drama but also the Shensi 
opera and the yangko dance. Not only must we have new Shensi 
operas and new yangko dances, but we must also utilize and gradually 
transform the old opera companies and the old yangko troupes, which 
comprise 90 per cent of all yangko troupes. This approach is even 
more necessary in the field of medicine. In the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia 
Border Region the human and animal mortality rates are both very high, 
and at the same time many people still believe in witchcraft. In such circumstances, 
to rely solely on modern doctors is no solution. Of course, 
modern doctors have advantages over doctors of the old type, but if 
they do not concern themselves with the sufferings of the people, do 
not train doctors for the people, do not unite with the thousand and 
more doctors and veterinarians of the old type in the Border Region 
and do not help them to make progress, then they will actually be 
helping the witch doctors and showing indifference to the high 
human and animal mortality rates. There are two principles for 
the united front: the first is to unite, and the second is to criticize, 
educate and transform. In the united front, capitulationism is wrong, 
and so is sectarianism with its exclusiveness and contempt for others. 
Our task is to unite with all intellectuals, artists and doctors of the 
old type who can be useful, to help them, convert them and transform 
them. In order to transform them, we must first unite with them. If 
we do it properly, they will welcome our help. 
Our culture is a people¹s culture; our cultural workers must serve 
the people with great enthusiasm and devotion, and they must link 
themselves with the masses, not divorce themselves from the masses. 
In order to do so, they must act in accordance with the needs and 
wishes of the masses. All work done for the masses must start 
from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however 
well-intentioned. It often happens that objectively the masses 
need a certain change, but subjectively they are not yet conscious 
of the need, not yet willing or determined to make the change. In 
such cases, we should wait patiently. We should not make the change 
until, through our work, most of the masses have become conscious 
of the need and are willing and determined to carry it out. Otherwise 
we shall isolate ourselves from the masses. Unless they are 
conscious and willing, any kind of work that requires their participation 
will turn out to be a mere formality and will fail. The saying ³Haste 
does not bring success² does not mean that we should not make haste,

237 THE UNITED FRONT IN CULTURAL WORK 
but that we should not be impetuous; impetuosity leads only to failure. 
This is true in any kind of work, and particularly in the cultural and 
educational work the aim of which is to transform the thinking of the 
masses. There are two principles here: one is the actual needs of the 
masses rather than what we fancy they need, and the other is the 
wishes of the masses, who must make up their own minds instead of 
our making up their minds for them.


WE MUST LEARN TO DO ECONOMIC WORK 
January 10, 1945
Heroes of Labour and Model Workers! 
You have attended this conference and summed up your experience; 
we all welcome you and honour you. You have three good 
qualities and you play three roles. First, the role of initiators. In other 
words, by your outstanding efforts and your numerous innovations you 
have made your work a model for others, raising standards and 
inspiring others to learn from you. Second, the role of backbone. Most 
of you are not yet cadres, but you have become the backbone, the 
hard core of the masses; with you, it is easier to push our work forward. 
In the future you may become cadres; at present you are cadres in 
reserve. Third, the role of a bridge. You are a bridge between the 
leadership and the broad masses; through you the opinions of the 
masses are transmitted to the leadership and vice versa. 
You have many good qualities and have rendered great service, 
but you must always remember not to become conceited. You are 
respected by all, and quite rightly, but this easily leads to conceit. If 
you become conceited, if you are not modest and cease to exert yourselves, 
and if you do not respect others, do not respect the cadres 
and the masses, then you will cease to be heroes and models. There 
have been such people in the past, and I hope you will not follow 
their example. 
This conference has summed up your experience. The summary 
is a very good one and is applicable in the other Liberated Areas as 
well. However, I am not going to dwell upon that. I should just like 
to say a few words about our economic work. 
In the past few years we have begun to learn how to do economic 
work and we have achieved substantial successes in this field, but it 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung delivered this speech at a conference of labour heroes 
and model workers of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
239

240 MAO TSE-TUNG 
is still only a beginning. We must see to it that within two or three 
years the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the Liberated 
Areas in the enemy¹s rear are completely or largely self-supporting in 
grain and manufactured goods, and even have a surplus. We must 
achieve still greater successes in agriculture, industry and trade. Only 
then can we regard ourselves as having learned more about economic 
work and as having learned to do it better. In places where there is 
no improvement in the living conditions of the troops and the people, 
where the material foundations for the counter-offensive remain unstable 
and agriculture, industry and trade stagnate or even decline instead of 
expanding year by year, it is evident that the personnel of the Party, 
government and army have not learned how to do economic work, 
and great difficulties will undoubtedly be encountered. 
There is one point I must again bring to everybody¹s attention, 
namely, that our ideas should be adapted to our immediate environment. 
Our immediate environment is rural; it would seem that nobody 
has any doubt on that score, for who does not know that we are living 
in the countryside? Yet actually, that is not the case. Many comrades 
do not understand the countryside at all, or at any rate not profoundly, 
although they live there and imagine they understand it. They do not 
proceed from the fact that our environment is the countryside, which 
is based on individual economy, cut up by the enemy and involved in 
guerrilla warfare, and the result is that their handling of political, 
military, economic and cultural problems, or of Party matters and the 
workers¹, peasants¹, youth and women¹s movements is often incorrect 
or only partially correct. They approach rural affairs from an urban 
viewpoint and often run their heads against a brick wall because they 
draw up many inappropriate plans subjectively and enforce them 
arbitrarily. In recent years our comrades have made much progress, 
thanks both to the rectification campaign and to the failures they have 
met with in their work. But we must still take care to adapt our ideas 
fully to our environment before we can obtain results in every field 
of work and do so quickly. If we truly understand the fact that the 
rural base areas in which we find ourselves are founded on individual 
economy, cut up by the enemy and involved in guerrilla warfare and 
make it the starting point in everything we do, then the pertinent 
question is, how do our results, which may seem slow and unspectacular, 
compare with the results of taking some other starting point, 
for instance, the urban viewpoint? Far from being slow, they are 
actually quite fast. For if we were to start from the urban viewpoint

241 WE MUST LEARN TO DO ECONOMIC WORK 
and depart from our present-day realities, the question would be not 
of getting fast or slow results, but of running into endless snags and 
getting no results at all. 
Clear proof of this fact is provided by the great success of the 
present form of the army and civilian production drive we have 
promoted. 
We want to hit the Japanese aggressors hard and make preparations 
for seizing the cities and recovering our lost territories. But how 
can we attain this aim, situated as we are in a countryside founded 
on individual economy, cut up by the enemy and involved in guerrilla 
warfare? We cannot imitate the Kuomintang, which does not lift a 
finger itself but depends entirely on foreigners even for such necessities 
as cotton cloth. We stand for self-reliance. We hope for foreign 
aid but cannot be dependent on it; we depend on our own efforts, on 
the creative power of the whole army and the entire people. But how 
do we go about it? By launching large-scale production campaigns 
simultaneously among the troops and the people. 
Since we are in the countryside, where manpower and material 
resources are scattered, we have adopted the policy of ³unified leadership 
and decentralized management² for production and supply. 
Since we are in the countryside, where the peasants are scattered 
individual producers employing backward means of production and 
where most of the land is still owned by landlords and the peasants 
are subjected to feudal rent exploitation, we have adopted the policies 
of reducing rent and interest and of organizing mutual aid in labour 
to heighten the peasants¹ enthusiasm for production and to increase 
the productivity of agricultural labour. Rent reduction has heightened 
the peasants¹ enthusiasm in production and mutual aid has increased 
the productivity of agricultural labour. I have obtained data from 
various places in northern and central China, all of which show that 
after rent reduction the peasants take much greater interest in production 
and are willing to organize mutual-aid groups like our labourexchange 
teams here, in which the productivity of three persons now 
equals that of four in the past. That being the case, 90 million people 
can do as much as 120 million. There are also instances of two persons 
doing what used to require the effort of three. If instead of coercion 
and commandism, which are self-defeating because of their quest for 
quick results, we adopt a policy of patiently persuading people by 
setting them good examples, then it will be possible for the majority 
of the peasants to be organized into mutual-aid groups for agricultural

242 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and handicraft production in the next few years. Once such production 
groups become the usual practice, not only will output increase and 
all kinds of innovations emerge, but there will also be political progress, 
a higher educational level, progress in hygiene, a remoulding of loafers 
and a change in social customs, and it will not take long before the 
implements of production will be improved, too. With all this happening, 
our rural society will gradually be rebuilt on new foundations. 
If our cadres carefully study this sphere of work and most energetically 
help the rural people develop campaigns for production, 
there will be a plentiful supply of grain and other necessities in 
the countryside within a few years, and we shall be able not only to 
keep up the war and cope with crop failures but also to maintain a 
large reserve of grain and other necessities for future use. 
We should organize the army units and the government and other 
organizations as well as the peasants for production. 
Since we are in the countryside, which is constantly ravaged by the 
enemy and involved in protracted war, it is imperative for the army 
units and the government and other organizations to engage in production. 
And it is possible for them to do so because the guerrilla fighting 
is scattered over a wide area. Besides, the troops and government 
personnel in our Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region are very numerous 
in proportion to the total population, and they will go hungry 
if they themselves do not engage in production, while on the other 
hand the people will go hungry if too much is taken from them and 
the burden is too heavy for them to bear. These are the reasons why 
we are resolved to launch a large-scale production campaign. Take the 
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, for instance. The annual requirements 
of the army units and the government and other organizations 
total 260,000 tan (here 1 tan equals 300 chin) of husked grain (millet), of 
which they get 160,000 from the people and produce the rest themselves; 
if they did not engage in production themselves, either they or the people 
would go hungry. Thanks to our production campaigns, we are free 
from hunger, and in fact the troops and the people are quite well fed. 
With the exception of grain, clothing and bedding, government 
and other organizations in the Border Region are self-supporting in 
most of their needs and some units are entirely self-supporting. Many 
units are partially self-supporting even in grain, clothing and bedding. 
The achievements of the army units of the Border Region are even 
greater. Many are entirely self-supporting in grain, clothing, bedding 
and every other essential, that is, they are 100 per cent self-supporting

243 WE MUST LEARN TO DO ECONOMIC WORK 
and draw nothing from the government. This is the highest standard, 
the top grade, and it has been attained gradually over a period of 
several years. 
This standard cannot be adopted at the front, where fighting has 
to be done. There a second and a third standard may be set up. The 
second standard requires that except for grain, clothing and bedding, 
which are supplied by the government, self-sufficiency through production 
should be achieved in the following items: cooking oil (0.5 liang 
per person per day), salt (0.5 liang per person per day), vegetables 
(1-1.5 chin per person per day), and meat (1-2 chin per person per 
month); the purchase of fuel, office supplies and miscellaneous items; 
subsidies for education and health; expenditures for the cleaning 
of weapons and for the provision of tobacco, shoes, socks, gloves, 
towels, tooth-brushes, etc.; these items amounting in all to some 50 
per cent of the total expenditure. This standard can be gradually 
attained in two or three years. In some places it has already been 
attained. This standard may be adopted in the stable base areas. 
The third standard applies to outlying districts and to the guerrilla 
zones where 50 per cent self-sufficiency is not possible but 15-25 per cent 
may be. Reaching this standard is good enough there. 
In short, apart from those in exceptional circumstances, all army 
units and government and other organizations must engage in production 
in the intervals between fighting, training or work. In addition 
to using such intervals for collective production, they should organize 
some of their personnel specifically for production, assigning them to 
run farms, vegetable gardens, pastures, workshops, small factories, 
transport teams and co-operatives, or to grow grain and vegetables in 
partnership with the peasants. In our present circumstances, every 
organization or army unit should establish its own ³domestic economy² 
to tide over the difficulties. Unwillingness to do so is a characteristic 
of loafers and is disgraceful. To stimulate production we should also 
institute a system of individual bonuses, graded according to the quality 
of the work, for all who participate in it directly. Further, as the 
effective way of pushing the work forward, the head of each organization 
must assume responsibility and personally take part, and must 
apply the method of linking the leading group with the masses and the 
general call with particular and specific guidance. 
Some people say that if the army units go in for production, they 
will be unable to train or fight and that if the government and other 
organizations do so, they will be unable to do their own work. This is

244 MAO TSE-TUNG 
a false argument. In recent years our army units in the Border Region 
have undertaken production on a big scale to provide themselves with 
ample food and clothing and have simultaneously done their training 
and conducted their political studies and literacy and other courses 
much more successfully than before, and there is greater unity than 
ever within the army and between the army and the people. While 
there was a large-scale production campaign at the front last year, 
great successes were gained in the fighting and in addition an extensive 
training campaign was started. And thanks to production, the personnel 
of the government and other organizations live a better life and work 
with greater devotion and efficiency; this is the case both in the Border 
Region and at the front. 
Thus it can be seen that in the context of guerrilla warfare in rural 
areas, those army units and government and other organizations which 
undertake production for self-support show greater energy and activity 
in their fighting, training and work, and improve their discipline and 
their unity both internally and with the civilians. Production for selfsupport 
is the outcome of our country¹s protracted guerrilla war and 
this is our glory. Once we master it, no material difficulty can daunt 
us. We shall grow in vigour and energy year by year and become 
stronger with every battle; we shall overwhelm the enemy and have 
no fear of his overwhelming us. 
Here another point must be called to the attention of our comrades 
at the front. Some of our recently established areas are fairly rich in 
material resources and, counting on this, the cadres there are unwilling 
either to economize or to engage in production. This is very bad, and 
they are bound to suffer for it later. Wherever we happen to be, we 
must treasure our manpower and material resources, and must not 
take a short view and indulge in wastefulness and extravagance. 
Wherever we are, from the very first year of our work we must bear 
in mind the many years to come, the protracted war that must be 
maintained, the counter-offensive, and the work of reconstruction 
after the enemy¹s expulsion. On the one hand, never be wasteful or 
extravagant; on the other, actively expand production. Previously, 
in some places people suffered a great deal because they did not take 
the long view and neglected economy in manpower and material 
resources and the expansion of production. The lesson is there and 
attention must be called to it. 
As regards manufactured goods, the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region has decided to become completely self-supporting in cotton,

245 WE MUST LEARN TO DO ECONOMIC WORK 
cotton yarn, cotton cloth, iron, paper and many other things within 
two years. We must grow, manufacture and supply whatever is not 
produced here or is produced only in small quantities, and must not 
depend on the outside at all. The whole task is to be accomplished by 
the public, private and co-operative enterprises. For all items, we 
demand not only quantity but also quality, that is, they must stand 
wear and tear. The Border Region Government, the Joint Defence 
Headquarters of the Eighth Route Army and the Northwest Bureau 
of the Central Committee of the Party are absolutely right in giving 
close attention to these matters. I hope that the same thing will be 
done in all places at the front. In many places it is already being done, 
and I wish them success. 
In our Border Region and the other Liberated Areas, it will take 
another two or three years for us to learn every branch of economic 
work. The day when we grow all or most of our own grain, manufacture 
all or most of our own goods and thus are completely or mainly selfsupporting 
and even have a surplus will also be the day when we have 
mastered every branch of economic work in the countryside. After 
we have cleared the cities of the enemy, we shall be able to take up 
new branches of economic work. We must exert ourselves and learn, 
because China depends on us for her reconstruction.


PRODUCTION IS ALSO POSSIBLE 
IN THE GUERRILLA ZONES 
January 31, 1945 
It is already admitted and there is no longer any doubt that production 
campaigns can and must be conducted in the army and among the 
people in the relatively stable bases of the Liberated Areas behind 
the enemy lines. But whether they can be conducted in the guerrilla 
zones and in the furthermost areas behind the enemy lines has not 
yet been settled in many people¹s minds for want of proof. 
But now we have proof. In 1944 production was undertaken on a 
considerable scale in many guerrilla zones and with excellent results, 
according to Comrade Chang Ping-kai¹s report on the production 
campaign of the guerrilla units in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei border 
area, published in the Liberation Daily of January 28. The districts 
and units listed in his report are: in central Hopei, the sixth sub-region, 
the fourth district contingent of the second sub-region, the eighth 
district contingent of the fourth sub-region, the Hsushui-Tinghsien 
detachment, the Paoting-Mancheng detachment and the Yunpiao 
detachment; and in Shansi, the troops in the counties of Taihsien and 
Kuohsien. Conditions in those areas are most unfavourable: 
The place bristles with enemy and puppet strongpoints and 
blockhouses and is criss-crossed with ditches, walls and roads, and 
taking advantage of his military superiority and communication 
facilities, the enemy often launches surprise attacks and encirclement 
and ³mopping-up² campaigns against us. Under such 
conditions the guerrilla units often have to shift their positions 
several times a day. 
Nevertheless, the guerrilla units have managed to carry on production 
in the intervals between fighting. The results are:

Everybody is now better fed  each person has 0.5 liang of 
cooking oil and salt and 1 chin of vegetables per day, and 1.5 chin 
of meat per month. Furthermore, tooth-brushes, tooth-powder and 
reading primers, which for years were unavailable, are now all 
provided. 
Just look! Who says that production is not possible in guerrilla zones? 
Many people claim that there is no spare land in the densely 
populated areas. Is there really no spare land? Again please look at 
the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei border area: 
First, the land problem has been settled in accordance with the 
policy of giving primary attention to agriculture. They use nine 
methods in all: (1) razing walls and filling in ditches used by the 
enemy for blockade purposes; (2) destroying motor roads the 
enemy may use and planting crops along them; (3) making use of 
small pieces of waste land; (4) helping the people¹s militia by 
providing armed protection when, on moonlit nights, crops are 
planted in the fields around the blockhouses in defiance of the 
enemy; (5) ploughing the fields in partnership with peasants who 
are short of labour power; (6) ploughing the fields around the 
enemy¹s strongpoints or blockhouses more or less openly, using 
soldiers dressed as peasants; (7) making use of river banks by 
building dykes, removing the sand and turning the banks into 
fields; (8) helping peasants bring dry land under irrigation; and 
(9) helping in the farm work in every village in which they are 
active. 
But if agriculture is possible, perhaps handicrafts and other production 
remain impossible? Is that actually the case? Please look at the 
Shansi-Chahar-Hopei border area: 
The troops in the vicinity of the enemy¹s blockade lines or 
blockade ditches do not confine their production to agriculture 
but, as in the stable areas, have also developed handicrafts and 
transport. The fourth district contingent has set up a felt-cap 
workshop, an oil press and a flour mill, and in seven months has 
netted a profit of 500,000 yuan in local currency. Not only has 
it settled its own difficulties but it is satisfying the needs of the 
people in its guerrilla zone. The soldiers can now provide all their 
own woollen sweaters and socks.

249 PRODUCTION IN THE GUERRILLA ZONES 
Since military operations are so frequent in the guerrilla zones, 
perhaps fighting is affected if the troops engage in production? Is that 
really so? Please look at the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei border area: 
Applying the principle of integrating labour power and armed 
strength, they give equal importance to the tasks of production 
and fighting. 
And 
Take, for instance, the fourth district contingent of the second 
sub-region. When they began their spring ploughing, they sent a 
special detachment to attack the enemy and at the same time 
launched a powerful political offensive. Precisely because of this, 
there was greater activity in the military sphere, too, and the combat 
effectiveness of the troops increased. From February to early 
September this small detachment fought 71 encounters, took the 
strongholds of Chutungsheh, Shangchuang, Yehchuang, Fengchiachai 
and Yaitou, inflicted 165 casualties on the enemy and puppet 
troops, and captured 91 puppet soldiers, 3 light machine-guns and 
101 rifles and pistols. 
And 
Co-ordinating military activity with propaganda for extensive 
production, they immediately launched a political offensive with 
the watchword: ³Smash anyone who tries to wreck the great production 
drivel² In the county towns of Taihsien and Kuohsien the 
enemy asked the inhabitants: ³Why has the Eighth Route Army 
become so tough recently?² They replied: ³Because you are trying 
to wreck the great production drive in the border area.² The 
puppet troops said to one another: ³Better not go out while they 
are carrying out this great production drive.² 
Is it possible to get the people in the guerrilla zones to launch a 
production campaign too? Are the peasants interested in increasing 
production in such zones, where rents have perhaps not yet been reduced 
or the rent reduction has not been thorough? This has been answered 
in the affirmative in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei border area: 
Furthermore, the troops in the vicinity of the enemy¹s blockade 
lines or blockade ditches give direct help to the local people by 
spreading the production campaign. On the one hand, they provide 
armed protection for the masses engaged in production and, on

250 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the other, they render extensive help by their labour. Some units 
have made it a rule to assign 50 per cent of their manpower to 
provide free help for the masses during the busy farming seasons. 
Thus, the enthusiasm of the masses for production has become very 
much greater, the relations between the army and the people have 
become still more harmonious, and the masses have enough to 
eat. Hence the sympathy and support of the masses in the guerrilla 
zones for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army have 
grown. 
All doubts have thus been answered as to whether the army and 
the people in the guerrilla zones can and must conduct large-scale 
production campaigns. We demand of all Party, government and army 
cadres in the Liberated Areas, and especially in the guerrilla zones, 
that they should attain full comprehension of this point, for once the 
³can² and the ³must² are understood, production will be set going 
everywhere. It was precisely from this point that the start was made 
in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei border area: 
In the production campaign the troops in the vicinity of the 
enemy¹s blockade lines or blockade ditches were not only able to 
fulfil their production plan on schedule in the short space of five 
months, but what is more, they introduced a number of practical 
innovations. This was because the cadres re-orientated their thinking, 
paid serious attention to production and to integrating labour 
power with armed strength, and brought forward labour heroes 
and model workers from among the masses (sixty-six labour heroes 
and model workers according to a preliminary summing-up). 
In 1945, the Liberated Areas must carry out a bigger army and 
civilian production campaign than ever before through the united 
efforts of all, and in the coming winter we shall compare the achievements 
of all the areas. 
War is not only a military and political contest but also an economic 
contest. In order to defeat the Japanese aggressors, in addition 
to all the other tasks we must apply ourselves to economic work and 
must master it within two or three years; in the present year, 1945, 
we must achieve greater results than ever before. This is what the 
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party eagerly expects 
of all our cadres and all the people throughout the Liberated Areas, 
and we hope this objective will be attained.

CHINA¹S TWO POSSIBLE DESTINIES 
IN CHINESE SOCIETY 
April 23, 1945 
Comrades! The Seventh National Congress of the Communist 
Party of China opens today. 
What is the significance of our congress? It is a congress, it should 
be said, that affects the destiny of China¹s 450 million people. China 
can have one of two destinies. Someone has written a book about one 
of them;1 our congress represents China¹s other destiny and we, too, 
shall write a book about it.2 The aim of our congress is the overthrow 
of Japanese imperialism and the liberation of all the people of China. 
Ours is a congress for the defeat of the Japanese aggressors and the 
building of a new China, for final victory through the unity of all the 
Chinese people and of the peoples of the whole world. 
The times are very favourable. In Europe, Hitler will soon be 
overthrown. The chief theatre of the world anti-fascist war is in the 
West, where the fighting will soon end in victory, thanks to the efforts 
of the Soviet Red Army. The guns of the Red Army can already be 
heard in Berlin, which will probably fall before long. In the East, 
too, victory in the war to overthrow Japanese imperialism is nigh. 
Our congress is meeting on the eve of final victory in the antifascist 
war. 
Two roads lie before the Chinese people, the road of light and the 
road of darkness. Two possible destinies await China, a destiny of 
light and a destiny of darkness. Japanese imperialism has not yet been 
defeated. But even after its defeat, the two prospects will still confront 
us. Either a China which is independent, free, democratic, united, 
prosperous and strong, that is, a China full of light, a new China 
whose people have won liberation, or a China which is semi-colonial, 
semi-feudal, divided, poor and weak, that is, the old China. The 
This was the opening speech at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist 
Party of China. 
251

252 MAO TSE-TUNG 
new China or the old China  these are the two prospects facing the 
Chinese people, the Communist Party of China and our present congress. 
Since Japan is not yet defeated and since the two prospects will 
still face us even after its defeat, how should we set about our work? 
What is our task? Our sole task is boldly to mobilize the masses, expand 
the people¹s forces and unite all the forces of the nation capable of 
being united in order to struggle under our Party¹s leadership to defeat 
the Japanese aggressors and build a bright new China, a China that is 
independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous and strong. We 
must strive with all our might for a bright future, a destiny of light, 
and against a dark future, a destiny of darkness. This is our one and 
only task! Indeed, it is the task of our congress, of our whole Party, 
and of all the people of China. 
Is it possible for our hopes to be realized? We believe it is. The 
possibility exists, because we already enjoy the following conditions: 
(1) A powerful Communist Party with rich experience and a 
membership of 1,210,000. 
(2) Powerful Liberated Areas with a population of 95,500,000, 
an army of 910,000 and a militia of 2,200,000. 
(3) The support of the masses throughout the country. 
(4) The support of the people of all countries, and especially 
of the Soviet Union. 
With these conditions  a powerful Communist Party, powerful 
Liberated Areas, the support of the masses throughout the country 
and the support of the people of the world  can our hopes be realized? 
We believe they can. China has never enjoyed these conditions before. 
Some have been present for a number of years, but never so fully as 
today. Our Communist Party has never been so powerful, the revolutionary 
base areas have never had so large a population and so large 
an army, the prestige of the Communist Party is higher than ever 
among the people both in the Japanese-occupied and in the Kuomintang 
areas, and the revolutionary forces of the Soviet Union and the 
people of all countries are stronger than ever before. One must say 
that, with these conditions, it is entirely possible to defeat the aggressors 
and build a new China. 
We must have a correct policy. The fundamental point of our 
policy is boldly to mobilize the masses and expand the people¹s forces 
so that, under the leadership of our Party, they will defeat the 
aggressors and build a new China.

253 CHINA¹S TWO POSSIBLE DESTINIES 
In the twenty-four years of its existence since its birth in 1921 the 
Communist Party of China has gone through three historical periods 
of heroic struggle  the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolutionary 
War and the War of Resistance Against Japan  and has 
accumulated a wealth of experience. Now our Party has become the 
centre of gravity of the Chinese people¹s struggle to resist Japan and 
save the nation, the centre of gravity of their struggle for liberation 
and of their struggle to defeat the aggressors and build a new China. 
China¹s centre of gravity lies right here where we are and nowhere else. 
We should be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and 
rashness, and serve the Chinese people heart and soul, in order to 
unite them for defeating the Japanese aggressors in the present and 
for building a new-democratic state in the future. Provided we do so, 
provided we have the correct policy and provided we make a united 
effort, we can definitely fulfil our task. 
Down with Japanese imperialism! 
Long live the liberation of the Chinese people! 
Long live the Communist Party of China! 
Long live the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party 
of China!

ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
April 24, 1945
I. THE FUNDAMENTAL DEMANDS OF 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE 
Our congress is being held in the following circumstances. A new 
situation has emerged after nearly eight years of resolute, heroic and 
indomitable struggle waged by the Chinese people with countless 
sacrifices and amid untold hardships against the Japanese aggressors; 
in the world as a whole, decisive victory has been gained in the just 
and sacred war against the fascist aggressors and the moment is near 
when the Japanese aggressors will be defeated by the Chinese people 
in co-ordination with the allied countries. But China remains disunited 
and is still confronted with a grave crisis. In these circumstances, 
what ought we to do? Beyond all doubt, the urgent need is to unite 
representatives of all political parties and groups and of people 
without any party affiliation and establish a provisional democratic 
coalition government for the purpose of instituting democratic reforms, 
surmounting the present crisis, mobilizing and unifying all the 
anti-Japanese forces in the country to fight in effective co-ordination 
with the allied countries for the defeat of the Japanese aggressors, 
and thus enabling the Chinese people to liberate themselves from the 
latter¹s clutches. After that it will be necessary to convene a national 
assembly on a broad democratic basis and set up a formally constituted 
democratic government, which will also be in the nature of a coalition 
and will have a still wider representation of people from all parties 
and groups or without any party affiliation, and which will lead the 
liberated people of the whole country in building an independent, free, 
democratic, united, prosperous and powerful new China. In short, we 
This was the political report made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung to the Seventh 
National Congress of the Communist Party of China. 
255

256 MAO TSE-TUNG 
must take the line of unity and democracy, defeat the aggressors and 
build a new China. 
We believe that this alone can give expression to the fundamental 
demands of the Chinese people. Therefore, my report will deal 
mainly with these demands. Whether or not a democratic coalition 
government should be set up has become a matter of deep concern 
for the Chinese people and for democratic public opinion in the allied 
countries. My report will therefore lay particular stress on elucidating 
this question. 
In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the 
Communist Party of China has overcome many difficulties and achieved 
great successes, but as things stand serious difficulties still confront 
our Party and people. The present situation demands that our Party 
should work still more solidly and intensively and that it should continue 
to overcome the difficulties and strive to fulfil the fundamental 
demands of the Chinese people. 
II. THE INTERNATIONAL AND 
THE DOMESTIC SITUATION 
Can the Chinese people translate these basic demands into reality? 
This will depend on the level of their political consciousness, their 
unity and their efforts. At the same time, the present international and 
domestic situation offers extremely favourable opportunities. If the 
Chinese people can make good use of these opportunities and continue 
to fight on staunchly, vigorously and persistently, they will undoubtedly 
defeat the aggressors and build a new China. They must redouble 
their efforts in their struggle to accomplish their sacred tasks. 
What is the present international situation? 
The present military situation is that the Soviet Army is attacking 
Berlin, and the allied forces of Britain, the United States and France 
are attacking the Hitlerite remnants in co-ordination with this offensive, 
while the Italian people are launching uprisings. All this will 
eliminate Hitler once and for all. After Hitler is wiped out, the defeat 
of the Japanese aggressors will not be far distant. Contrary to the 
predictions of the Chinese and foreign reactionaries, the forces of 
fascist aggression will undoubtedly be overthrown and the people¹s 
democratic forces will undoubtedly triumph. The world will unques

257 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
tionably take the road of progress and not the road of reaction. Of 
course, we must remain very much on the alert and reckon with the 
possibility of certain temporary or perhaps even serious twists and 
turns in the course of events; in many countries there are still strong 
reactionary forces which begrudge the people at home and abroad their 
unity, progress and liberation. Anyone who loses sight of this possibility 
will make political mistakes. The general trend of history, 
however, is already clearly decided and will not change. This is bad 
only for the fascists and for the reactionaries of all countries who are 
in fact their helpers, but it is a blessing for the people and for the 
organized democratic forces in all countries. The people, and the people 
alone, are the motive force of world history. The Soviet people 
have built up great strength and become the main force in the defeat 
of fascism. It is their efforts, plus those of the people in the other 
anti-fascist allied countries, which are making the destruction of 
fascism possible. War has educated the people and it is the people 
who will win the war, win the peace and win progress. 
This new situation is very different from that in World War I. 
The Soviet Union was not yet in existence then and the people were 
not politically awakened as they are in many countries today. The 
two world wars represent two entirely different epochs. 
This does not mean that there will be no more struggles after the 
defeat of the fascist aggressor countries, the end of World War II 
and the establishment of international peace. The remnant forces of 
fascism which are still widespread will certainly continue to make 
trouble, while within the camp now fighting fascist aggression there 
are forces which oppose democracy and oppress other nations, and 
they will continue to oppress the people in various countries and in 
the colonies and semi-colonies. Therefore, after international peace 
is established, there will still be numerous struggles over the greater 
part of the world  between the anti-fascist masses and the remnants 
of fascism, between democracy and anti-democracy, between national 
liberation and national oppression. The people will achieve the most 
extensive victory only through long and sustained efforts, when the 
remaining forces of fascism, the anti-democratic forces and all the 
imperialist forces are overcome. To be sure, that day will not come 
very quickly or easily, but come it surely will. Victory in the antifascist 
Second World War will pave the way for the victory of the 
people in their post-war struggles. A stable and lasting peace will be 
ensured only when victory is won in these struggles.

258 MAO TSE-TUNG 
What is the present domestic situation? 
China¹s protracted war has exacted and will continue to exact 
great sacrifices from the Chinese people, but at the same time this 
very war has tempered them. It has awakened and united the Chinese 
people to a greater degree than all their great struggles in the last 
hundred years. The Chinese people face not only a formidable national 
enemy but also powerful domestic reactionary forces which are in 
fact helping the enemy; this is one side of the picture. But the 
other side is that the Chinese people are not only more politically 
conscious than ever before but have built powerful Liberated Areas 
and a nation-wide democratic movement that is growing day by day. 
These constitute favourable domestic conditions. If the defeats and 
setbacks in the Chinese people¹s struggles of the last hundred years 
were due to the absence of certain necessary international and 
domestic conditions, then today the situation is different  all the 
necessary conditions are present. There is every possibility of avoiding 
defeat and winning victory. We shall be victorious if we can 
unite the whole people in resolute struggle and give them proper 
leadership. 
The Chinese people now have much greater confidence that they 
can unite to defeat the aggressors and build a new China. The time 
has come for them to conquer all difficulties and achieve their fundamental 
demands, their great historic aspirations. Is there any doubt 
about it? I think not. 
Such is the general international and domestic situation today. 
III. TWO LINES IN THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR 
THE KEY TO CHINA¹S PROBLEMS 
In speaking of the domestic situation, we have also to make a 
specific analysis of China¹s War of Resistance. 
China is one of the five biggest countries taking part in the war 
against fascism and it is the principal country fighting the Japanese 
aggressors on the continent of Asia. Not only have the Chinese people 
played a very great role in the war against Japan, but they will also 
play a very great role in safeguarding peace in the post-war world 
and the decisive one in safeguarding peace in the East. China has

259 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
made very great efforts to liberate herself and to help the allied 
countries during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against 
Japan. These efforts have been made primarily by the people of 
China. Vast numbers of officers and men in China¹s armies have 
fought and shed their blood at the front; the workers, peasants, intellectuals 
and industrialists of China have worked hard in the rear; 
the Chinese overseas have made donations to support the war; and 
all the anti-Japanese political parties, except for such of their members 
as are opposed to the people, have played their part in the war. In 
short, with their blood and sweat, the Chinese people have heroically 
fought the Japanese aggressors for eight long years. But for a number 
of years the Chinese reactionaries have been spreading rumours and 
misleading public opinion in order to prevent the world from knowing 
the truth about the role played by the Chinese people in the war. 
Besides, there has as yet been no comprehensive summing-up of the 
varied experience gained by China during these eight years of war. 
Therefore, this congress should make a proper summing-up of all 
this experience in order to educate the people and provide our Party 
with a basis for the formulation of policy. 
When it comes to such summing up, it is plain to all that there 
are two different guiding lines in China. One leads to the defeat 
of the Japanese aggressors, while the other not only makes their 
defeat impossible but in some respects actually helps them and undermines 
our War of Resistance. 
The Kuomintang government¹s policy of passive resistance to 
Japan and its reactionary domestic policy of active repression of the 
people have resulted in military setbacks, enormous territorial losses, 
financial and economic crisis, oppression and hardship for the people 
and the disruption of national unity. This reactionary policy has been 
an obstruction to mobilizing and uniting all the anti-Japanese forces 
of the Chinese people for the effective prosecution of the war, and 
has hindered the awakening and unity of the people. Yet this political 
awakening and this unity have never ceased to develop, but have 
moved forward along a tortuous course, under the twofold repression 
of the Japanese aggressors and the Kuomintang government. Clearly, 
there have been two lines in China for a long time, the Kuomintang 
government¹s line of oppression of the people and of passive resistance, 
and the Chinese people¹s line of enhancing their own consciousness 
and unity for the waging of a people¹s war. Herein lies the key to all 
China¹s problems.

260 MAO TSE-TUNG 
HISTORY FOLLOWS A TORTUOUS COURSE 
To help people understand why this question of the two lines is 
the key to all of China¹s problems, it is necessary to trace the history 
of our War of Resistance Against Japan. 
The Chinese people¹s War of Resistance has followed a tortuous 
course. It began as far back as 1931. On September 18 of that year, the 
Japanese aggressors occupied Shenyang, and within a few months 
they seized the three northeastern provinces. The Kuomintang government 
adopted a policy of non-resistance. But against the will of the 
Kuomintang government and led or assisted by the Chinese Communist 
Party, the people and a patriotic section of the troops of 
these provinces organized the Anti-Japanese Volunteers and the Anti- 
Japanese United Army and engaged in heroic guerrilla warfare. At 
one time this heroic guerrilla warfare grew to great dimensions and, 
despite many difficulties and setbacks, it has never been put down 
by the enemy. When the Japanese aggressors attacked Shanghai in 
1932, a group of patriots in the Kuomintang once again defied the will 
of the Kuomintang government and led the 19th Route Army in 
resisting the Japanese aggressors. In 1933 the Japanese aggressors 
invaded Jehol and Chahar Provinces, and for the third time a group 
of patriots in the Kuomintang defied the will of the Kuomintang 
government and co-operated with the Communist Party in organizing 
the Anti-Japanese Allied Army to resist the enemy. But in all this 
fighting against Japan support came entirely from the Chinese people, 
the Chinese Communist Party, other democratic groups and the patriotic 
Chinese overseas, while the Kuomintang government with its policy of 
non-resistance contributed nothing. On the contrary, the anti-Japanese 
actions in Shanghai and Chahar were both wrecked by the Kuomintang 
government itself. In 1933 it also destroyed the people¹s government 
which had been established in Fukien by the 19th Route Army. 
Why did the Kuomintang government of that day adopt a 
policy of non-resistance? The main reason was that it had wrecked 
Kuomintang-Communist co-operation and the unity of the Chinese 
people in 1927. 
In 1924 Dr. Sun Yat-sen, accepting the proposals of the Chinese 
Communist Party, called the First National Congress of the Kuomintang 
in which Communists took part, adopted the Three Great 
Policies of alliance with Russia, co-operation with the Communist 
Party and assistance to the peasants and workers, established the

261 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
Whampoa Military Academy and formed the national united front 
of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party and all sections of the 
people. As a result, the reactionary forces in Kwangtung Province were 
destroyed in 1924-25, the triumphant Northern Expedition was carried 
out during 1926-27, most of the areas along the Yangtse and Yellow 
Rivers were taken over, the Northern warlord government was 
defeated, and the people¹s struggle for liberation was unfolded on a 
scale never before seen in Chinese history. But at a critical moment 
in the progress of the Northern Expedition, in the late spring and 
early summer of 1927, the treacherous and reactionary policies of 
³party purge² and massacre adopted by the Kuomintang authorities 
wrecked this national united front  the united front of the Kuomintang, 
the Communist Party and all sections of the people, which 
embodied the Chinese people¹s cause of liberation  and all its revolutionary 
policies. Yesterday¹s allies, the Chinese Communist Party and 
the Chinese people, were now regarded as enemies, and yesterday¹s 
enemies, the imperialists and feudalists, were now regarded as allies. 
So it came about that a sudden attack was perfidiously launched 
against the Chinese Communist Party and the people, and the great, 
dynamic and vigorous revolution was crushed. Thereupon unity was 
replaced by civil war, democracy by dictatorship, and a China full of 
brightness by a China covered in darkness. But the Chinese Communist 
Party and the Chinese people were neither cowed nor conquered nor 
exterminated. They picked themselves up, wiped off the blood, buried 
their fallen comrades and went into battle again. Holding high the 
great standard of revolution, they rose in armed resistance and over 
a vast territory in China they set up people¹s governments, carried 
out land reform, built up a people¹s army  the Chinese Red Army  
and preserved and expanded the revolutionary forces of the Chinese 
people. Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s revolutionary Three People¹s Principles, 
which the Kuomintang reactionaries had discarded, were carried 
forward by the people, the Communist Party and other democrats. 
After the invasion of the three northeastern provinces by the 
Japanese aggressors, the Chinese Communist Party in 1933 proposed 
to all the Kuomintang forces then attacking the revolutionary base 
areas and the Red Army that an armistice agreement be concluded 
to facilitate united resistance to Japan; this proposal was made with 
three conditions  that the attacks should stop, that the people should 
be granted democratic rights, and that the people should be armed. 
But the Kuomintang authorities rejected it.

262 MAO TSE-TUNG 
From then on the Kuomintang government¹s policy of civil war 
became increasingly vicious, while the voice of the Chinese people 
grew increasingly powerful in its demand for an end to civil war and 
for united resistance to Japan. All kinds of popular patriotic organizations 
were formed in Shanghai and many other places. Between 
1934 and 1936, under the leadership of the Central Committee of our 
Party, the main forces of the Red Army north and south of the Yangtse 
River went through untold hardships and moved to northwestern 
China, joining forces with the Red Army units there. It was in those 
two years that the Chinese Communist Party decided on, and carried 
out, a new and comprehensive political line in keeping with the new 
situation  the line of the National United Front Against Japan, 
with united resistance to Japan and the establishment of a newdemocratic 
republic as the goal of struggle. On December 9, 1935, the 
student masses in Peiping launched a heroic patriotic movement under 
our Party¹s leadership; they formed the Chinese National Liberation 
Vanguard Corps1 and spread this movement to all the big cities in 
China. On December 12, 1936, two patriotic Kuomintang groups which 
favoured resistance to Japan, the Northeastern Army and the 17th 
Route Army, together staged the famous Sian Incident in courageous 
opposition to the reactionary Kuomintang policy of compromising 
with Japan and massacring the people at home. Other patriots in the 
Kuomintang were likewise dissatisfied with the policy of the Kuomintang 
authorities at the time. These were the circumstances in which 
the Kuomintang authorities were forced to abandon their policy of 
civil war and to acknowledge the demands of the people. The peaceful 
settlement of the Sian Incident became the turning point; under the 
new circumstances internal co-operation took shape and the nationwide 
War of Resistance Against Japan began. In May 1937, shortly 
before the Lukouchiao Incident,2 our Party called the historic national 
conference at which the new political line followed by the Central 
Committee of the Party since 1935 was endorsed. 
From the Lukouchiao Incident of July 7, 1937 to the fall of Wuhan 
in October 1938, the Kuomintang government was relatively active 
in the war against Japan. During that period the large-scale Japanese 
attacks and the mounting patriotic indignation of the whole people 
compelled the Kuomintang government to make resistance to the 
Japanese aggressors the centre of gravity of its policy, which made 
it easier to bring about an upsurge in the struggle of the whole army and 
people against Japan, and for a time there was a new and dynamic

263 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
atmosphere. All the people, including the Communists and other 
democrats, earnestly hoped that the Kuomintang government would 
seize the opportunity, at a time when the nation was in peril and the 
people were filled with enthusiasm, to institute democratic reforms 
and put Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s revolutionary Three People¹s Principles into 
practice. But their hopes came to nought. Even in those two years of 
relatively active resistance, the Kuomintang authorities continued to 
oppose the mobilization of the masses for a people¹s war and to place 
restrictions on the people¹s spontaneous efforts to unite for anti- 
Japanese and democratic action. While the Kuomintang government 
had somewhat changed its previous attitude to the Chinese Communist 
Party and the other anti-Japanese parties, it continued to deny 
them equal status and restrict their activities in many ways. Patriotic 
political prisoners were still kept in jail in large numbers. Above all, 
the Kuomintang government still maintained the oligarchic dictatorship 
it had established after launching the civil war in 1927, so that 
it was impossible to set up a democratic coalition government representing 
the unanimous will of the nation. 
At the very beginning of this period we Communists pointed out 
that there were two alternative lines for China¹s War of Resistance 
Against Japan, an all-embracing people¹s war leading to victory, or 
a partial war in which the people remained oppressed, leading to 
defeat. We also pointed out that the war would be protracted and 
would inevitably involve many obstacles and hardships, but that by 
their exertions the Chinese people were sure to win the final victory. 
THE PEOPLE¹S WAR 
During the same period the main forces of the Communist-led Red 
Army, which had moved to northwestern China, were redesignated 
as the Eighth Route Army of the Chinese National Revolutionary 
Army, while the Chinese Red Army¹s guerrilla units, which had remained 
in various places on both sides of the Yangtse River, were 
redesignated as the New Fourth Army of the Chinese National Revolutionary 
Army. The former went to fight on the northern China front 
and the latter on the central China front. During the civil war period, 
the Chinese Red Army, which had preserved and developed the 
democratic tradition of the Whampoa Military Academy and of the 
National Revolutionary Army of the Northern Expedition days, had 
at one time grown to several hundred thousand men. But by the

264 MAO TSE-TUNG 
beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan it had been reduced 
to a few tens of thousands as a result of the ruthless destruction wrought 
in our southern base areas by the Kuomintang government, our losses 
during the Long March, and other causes. Consequently there were 
some who looked down on this army and thought that the main 
reliance for resistance to Japan should be placed on the Kuomintang. 
But the people are the best judges. The people knew that despite 
their small number at the time, the Eighth Route and New Fourth 
Armies were of high quality, that they alone could wage a real people¹s 
war and that boundless prospects would open up before them 
once they reached the anti-Japanese fronts and joined with the broad 
masses there. And the people were right. By now, as I make this report, 
our army has already expanded to 910,000 men, and the number of 
our rural militia, who are not withdrawn from normal productive 
work, has grown to more than 2,200,000. Despite the fact that our 
regular army is still numerically much smaller than that of the Kuomintang 
(counting the Kuomintang units under local as well as central 
control), it has already become the main force in China¹s War of 
Resistance, judging by the number of Japanese and puppet forces it 
is engaging and the extent of its battle fronts, by its combat effectiveness, 
by the mass support it enjoys in its operations, and by its political 
quality, cohesion and unity. 
This army is powerful because all its members have a discipline 
based on political consciousness, they have come together and they 
fight not for the private interests of a few individuals or a narrow 
clique, but for the interests of the broad masses and of the whole nation. 
The sole purpose of this army is to stand firmly with the Chinese 
people and to serve them whole-heartedly. 
Guided by this purpose, this army has an indomitable spirit and 
is determined to vanquish all enemies and never to yield. No matter 
what the difficulties and hardships, so long as a single man remains, 
he will fight on. 
Guided by this purpose, this army has achieved remarkable unity 
in its own ranks and with those outside its ranks. Internally, there is 
unity between officers and men, between the higher and lower ranks, 
and between military work, political work and rear service work; 
and externally, there is unity between the army and the people, 
between the army and government organizations, and between our 
army and the friendly armies. It is imperative to overcome anything 
that impairs this unity.

265 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
Guided by this purpose, this army has a correct policy for winning 
over enemy officers and men and for dealing with prisoners of war. 
Without exception all members of the enemy forces who surrender, 
who come over to our side or who, after laying down their arms, 
wish to join in fighting the common foe, are welcomed and given 
proper education. It is forbidden to kill, maltreat or insult any 
prisoner of war. 
Guided by this purpose, this army has built up a system of strategy 
and tactics which is essential for the people¹s war. It is skilled in flexible 
guerrilla warfare conducted in accordance with the changing concrete 
conditions and is also skilled in mobile warfare. 
Guided by this purpose, this army has built up a system of political 
work which is essential for the people¹s war and is aimed at promoting 
unity in its own ranks, unity with the friendly armies and 
unity with the people, and at disintegrating the enemy forces and 
ensuring victory in battle. 
Guided by this purpose, the entire army, operating under conditions 
of guerrilla warfare, is able to utilize, and has in fact utilized, 
the intervals between battles and between training periods to produce 
grain and other necessities, thus becoming wholly, half or at least 
partly self-supporting, so that economic difficulties are overcome, living 
conditions improved and the burden on the people lightened. Every 
possibility has been exploited to establish a number of small-scale 
armament works in various military base areas. 
Furthermore, this army is powerful because it has the people¹s 
self-defence corps and the militia  the vast armed organizations of 
the masses  fighting in co-ordination with it. In the Liberated Areas 
of China all men and women, from youth to middle age, are organized 
in the people¹s anti-Japanese self-defence corps on a voluntary and 
democratic basis and without giving up their work in production. The 
cream of the self-defence corps, except for those who join the army 
or the guerrilla units, is brought into the militia. Without the cooperation 
of these armed forces of the masses it would be impossible 
to defeat the enemy. 
Finally, this army is powerful because of its division into two 
parts, the main forces and the regional forces, with the former available 
for operations in any region whenever necessary and the latter 
concentrating on defending their own localities and attacking the 
enemy there in co-operation with the local militia and the self-defence 
corps. This division of labour has won the whole-hearted support of

266 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the people. Without this correct division of labour  if, for example, 
attention were paid only to the role of the main forces while that of 
the regional forces were neglected  it would likewise be impossible 
to defeat the enemy in the conditions obtaining in China¹s Liberated 
Areas. Under the regional forces, numerous armed working teams 
have been organized, which are well trained and hence better qualified 
for military, political and mass work; they penetrate into the rearmost 
areas behind the enemy lines, strike at the enemy and arouse the 
masses to anti-Japanese struggle, thus giving support to the frontal 
military operations of the various Liberated Areas. In all this they 
have achieved great success. 
Under the leadership of their democratic governments, all the 
anti-Japanese people in the Liberated Areas of China are called upon 
to join organizations of workers, peasants, youth and women, and 
cultural, professional and other organizations, which will wholeheartedly 
perform various tasks in support of the armed forces. These 
tasks are not limited to rallying the people to join the army, transporting 
grain for it, caring for soldiers¹ families and helping the troops in 
meeting their material needs. They also include mobilizing the guerrilla 
units, militia and self-defence corps to make widespread raids and 
lay land mines against the enemy, gather intelligence about him, comb 
out traitors and spies, transport and protect the wounded and take 
direct part in the army¹s operations. At the same time, the people in 
all the Liberated Areas are enthusiastically taking up various kinds 
of political, economic, cultural and health work. The most important 
thing in this connection is to mobilize everybody for the production 
of grain and other necessities and to ensure that all government 
institutions and schools, except in special cases, devote their free time 
to production for their own support in order to supplement the 
self-sufficiency production campaigns of the army and the people 
and thus help to create a great upsurge of production to sustain the 
protracted War of Resistance. In China¹s Liberated Areas, the enemy 
has wrought great havoc, and floods, droughts and damage by insect 
pests have been frequent. However, the democratic governments there 
have been leading the people in overcoming these difficulties in an 
organized way, and unprecedented results have been achieved by the 
great mass campaigns for pest extermination, flood control and disaster 
relief, thus making it possible to persevere in the protracted War of 
Resistance. In a word, everything for the front, everything for the 
defeat of the Japanese aggressors and for the liberation of the Chinese

267 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
people  this is the general slogan, the general policy for the whole 
army and the whole people in the Liberated Areas of China. 
Such is a real people¹s war. Only by waging such a people¹s war 
can we defeat the national enemy. The Kuomintang has failed precisely 
because of its desperate opposition to a people¹s war. 
Once it is equipped with modern weapons, the army of China¹s 
Liberated Areas will become still more powerful and will be able to 
accomplish the final defeat of the Japanese aggressors. 
TWO BATTLE FRONTS 
From the very beginning there have been two fronts in China¹s 
War of Resistance, the Kuomintang front and the front of the 
Liberated Areas. 
After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the Japanese aggressors 
stopped their strategic offensive against the Kuomintang front and 
gradually shifted their main forces to the front of the Liberated Areas; 
at the same time, taking advantage of the defeatist sentiments of the 
Kuomintang government, they declared their willingness to arrive at 
a compromise peace with it, and, adopting a policy designed to deceive 
the Chinese nation, they induced the traitor Wang Ching-wei to leave 
Chungking and establish a puppet government in Nanking. The Kuomintang 
government then began to change its policy, gradually shifting 
the emphasis from resistance to Japan to opposition to the Communist 
Party and the people. This shift first made itself apparent in the 
military sphere. To conserve its own military strength, the Kuomintang 
government adopted the policy of passive resistance to Japan; it threw 
the burden of fighting onto the front of the Liberated Areas by letting 
the Japanese invaders attack the Liberated Areas in force, while itself 
³sitting on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight². 
In 1939, the Kuomintang government adopted the reactionary 
³Measures for Restricting the Activities of Alien Parties² and completely 
deprived the people and the anti-Japanese parties of whatever 
rights they had won during the early period of the War of Resistance. 
From then on, in the Kuomintang areas, all the democratic parties, 
and first and foremost the Communist Party of China, have been 
driven underground by the Kuomintang government. In every province 
in these areas the prisons and concentration camps are packed with 
Communists, young patriots and other fighters for democracy. In the 
five years from 1939 to the autumn of 1943, the Kuomintang government

268 MAO TSE-TUNG 
launched three large-scale anti-Communist onslaughts3 to split national 
unity, and thus created serious danger of civil war. It was in this period 
that the ³disbanding² of the New Fourth Army was ordered and more 
than nine thousand of its troops in southern Anhwei were annihilated 
 an event which shocked the world. To this very moment the attacks 
by Kuomintang troops on the forces of the Liberated Areas have not 
ceased, nor is there any sign that they will. At the same time, the Kuomintang 
reactionaries have been pouring out slanders and calumnies 
of all sorts. It is they who have fabricated such labels and expressions as 
³traitor party², ³traitor army², ³traitor areas², and ³sabotaging the War 
of Resistance and endangering the state², for the purpose of maligning 
the Communist Party, the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and 
the Liberated Areas. To meet the crisis, on July 7, 1939 the Central Committee 
of the Chinese Communist Party issued a manifesto setting 
forth the following slogans, ³Persist in resistance and oppose capitulation! 
Persist in unity and oppose a split! Persist in progress and oppose 
retrogression!² In these five years, our Party, acting on these timely 
slogans, vigorously repulsed the three reactionary and anti-popular 
anti-Communist onslaughts and overcame the crisis on each occasion. 
There was actually no serious fighting on the Kuomintang front 
during those years. The sword-edge of Japanese aggression was mainly 
directed against the Liberated Areas. By 1943, the army and the people 
of the Liberated Areas were pinning down 64 per cent of the Japanese 
forces invading China and 95 per cent of the puppet troops, while the 
Kuomintang front faced only 36 per cent of the former and 5 per cent 
of the latter. 
In 1944 the Japanese aggressors launched operations to force China¹s 
north-south trunk railways open for through traffic;4 panic-stricken, 
the Kuomintang forces were totally incapable of offering resistance. 
Within a few months extensive areas in Honan, Hunan, Kwangsi and 
Kwangtung Provinces had fallen into the enemy¹s hands. It was not 
until then that some change took place in the proportion of enemy 
forces engaged on the two fronts. Even so, at the moment of making 
this report, of the 40 divisions comprising 580,000 Japanese soldiers 
in China (not counting those in the three northeastern provinces), 22 
divisions, comprising 320,000 men or 56 per cent of the total forces, are 
engaged on the front of the Liberated Areas, and no more than 17 
divisions, comprising 260,000 men or 44 per cent, are engaged on the 
Kuomintang front. As for the puppet troops engaged on the two 
fronts, the ratio has not changed at all.

269 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
It should also be pointed out that the puppet troops, numbering 
more than 800,000 men (in both the regular and the local forces), are 
chiefly composed either of units that surrendered under their Kuomintang 
commanders or of units organized by the Kuomintang officers 
after their surrender. The Kuomintang reactionaries have furnished 
these puppet troops in advance with a false and traitorous theory, 
namely, ³saving the nation by a devious path², and have given them 
moral and organizational support since their surrender, directing them 
to attack the Chinese people¹s Liberated Areas in co-ordination with 
the Japanese aggressors. These reactionaries have also mustered large 
forces, totalling no less than 797,000 men, to blockade and attack the 
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and other Liberated Areas. This 
grave situation is being kept from the knowledge of many Chinese and 
foreigners by the Kuomintang government¹s policy of suppressing news. 
CHINA¹S LIBERATED AREAS 
China¹s Liberated Areas, led by the Communist Party, now have a 
population of 95,500,000. They exist from Inner Mongolia in the north 
to Hainan Island in the south; almost everywhere the enemy goes, he 
finds the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army or some other 
people¹s forces in operation. This vast liberated territory consists of 
nineteen major Liberated Areas, covering greater or lesser parts of the 
provinces of Liaoning, Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shensi, Kansu, Ningsia, 
Shansi, Hopei, Honan, Shantung, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Anhwei, Kiangsi, 
Hupeh, Hunan, Kwangtung and Fukien. Yenan is the centre from 
which guidance is given to all these Liberated Areas. The Shensi- 
Kansu-Ningsia Border Region west of the Yellow River, with a 
population of only 1,500,000, is but one of the nineteen areas forming 
this vast liberated part of China and, indeed, the smallest in population 
except for one in eastern Chekiang Province and another on 
Hainan Island. Unaware of this, some people think China¹s liberated 
territory consists chiefly of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
This misconception arises from the Kuomintang government¹s blockade. 
In every one of the Liberated Areas, all the requisite policies of the 
Anti-Japanese National United Front have been put into practice, 
and popularly elected governments, that is, local coalition governments, 
have been or are being set up, in which Communists and representative 
personalities of other anti-Japanese parties or without any party 
affiliation are co-operating. The entire strength of the people has been

270 MAO TSE-TUNG 
mobilized in the Liberated Areas. As a result, despite the formidable 
pressure of the enemy, the Kuomintang¹s military blockade and attacks 
and the complete absence of outside help, China¹s Liberated Areas 
have stood firm and have grown steadily, reducing the territory 
occupied by the enemy and extending their own; they have become 
the model for a democratic China and the main force driving out the 
Japanese aggressors and liberating the Chinese people in military 
co-operation with the allied countries. The armed forces of China¹s 
Liberated Areas, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and 
the other armed forces of the people, have not only set a heroic example 
in fighting Japan, but have also set an example in carrying out the 
democratic policies of the Anti-Japanese National United Front. The 
declaration issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China on September 22, 1937 affirming that ³Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s 
Three People¹s Principles being what China needs today, our Party 
is ready to fight for their complete realization², has been completely 
carried into effect in China¹s Liberated Areas. 
THE KUOMINTANG AREAS 
Persisting in its dictatorial rule, the chief ruling clique of the Kuomintang 
has followed a policy of passive resistance to Japan and a 
domestic policy directed against the people. In consequence, its armed 
forces have shrunk to less than half their original size and most 
of them have virtually lost their combat effectiveness; there is a 
profound rift between this clique and the broad masses and a grave 
crisis of mass impoverishment, seething discontent and widespread 
revolt; not only has its role in the war been sharply reduced, but it 
has also become an obstacle to the mobilization and unity of all the 
anti-Japanese forces of the Chinese people. 
Why has such a grave situation arisen under the leadership of the 
Kuomintang¹s chief ruling clique? It has arisen because that clique 
represents the interests of China¹s big landlords, big bankers and big 
compradors. The handful of people forming this reactionary stratum 
monopolize all the important military, political, economic and cultural 
organizations under the Kuomintang government. They place the safeguarding 
of their own interests above resistance to Japan. They too 
say ³the nation above all², but their actions do not accord with the 
demands of the great majority of the nation. They too say ³the state 
above all², but what they mean is the feudal-fascist dictatorship of

271 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
the big landlords, big bankers and big compradors, and not a democratic 
state of the people. Therefore they are afraid of the rise of the 
people, afraid of the democratic movement and afraid of full mass 
mobilization for war against Japan. Herein lies the root cause of their 
policy of passive resistance to Japan and their reactionary domestic 
policy against the people, democracy and the Communist Party. They 
have a double-faced policy in everything. For instance, on the one 
hand they are resisting Japan but on the other they are pursuing a 
passive war policy, and moreover they are the constant target of 
Japanese inducements to surrender. They talk about developing China¹s 
economy, but in fact they build up their own bureaucrat-capital, i.e., 
the capital of the big landlords, bankers and compradors, and monopolize 
the lifelines of China¹s economy, ruthlessly oppressing the 
peasants, the workers, the petty bourgeoisie and the non-monopoly 
bourgeoisie. They talk about putting ³democracy² into practice and 
³handing state power back to the people², yet they ruthlessly suppress 
the people¹s movement for democracy and refuse to introduce the 
mildest democratic reform. They say that ³the Communist problem is 
a political one and should be solved politically², yet they ruthlessly 
suppress the Chinese Communist Party militarily, politically and economically, 
regarding it as ³enemy No. 1² and the Japanese aggressors 
as only ³enemy No. 2², and day in and day out they busy themselves 
with preparations for a civil war and plots to annihilate the Communist 
Party. They say they will establish a ³modern state², yet they work 
desperately to maintain the feudal-fascist dictatorship of the big landlords, 
bankers and compradors. While maintaining formal diplomatic 
relations with the Soviet Union, they are in fact hostile to it. They 
chant ³Asia before Europe² in chorus with the U.S. isolationists in 
order to prolong the life of fascist Germany, which amounts to prolonging 
the life of fascists everywhere, including their own fascist rule 
over the Chinese people, yet at the same time they indulge in diplomatic 
manoeuvres, masquerading as anti-fascist heroes. If you look 
for the root of these contradictory double-faced policies, you will find 
they all stem from the social stratum of the big landlords, bankers 
and compradors. 
Nevertheless, the Kuomintang is not a homogeneous political 
party. Though it is controlled and led by the reactionary clique representing 
the stratum of the big landlords, bankers and compradors, 
it must not be entirely identified with this clique. Some Kuomintang 
leaders do not belong to this clique by which they are even slighted,

272 MAO TSE-TUNG 
pushed aside or attacked. Many of its cadres and rank and file and 
many members of the Three People¹s Principles Youth League are 
dissatisfied with the leadership of this clique, and some even oppose 
it. The same is true of all the Kuomintang armies, government organs 
and economic and cultural institutions which this reactionary clique 
controls. There are quite a number of democratic elements in all of 
them. Moreover, the reactionary clique itself, divided as it is into 
several contending factions, is not a close-knit body. Undoubtedly 
it is wrong to regard the Kuomintang as a homogeneous body of 
reactionaries. 
A CONTRAST 
The Chinese people have come to see the sharp contrast between 
the Liberated Areas and the Kuomintang areas. 
Are not the facts clear enough? Here are two lines, the line of a 
people¹s war and the line of passive resistance, which is against a people¹s 
war; one leads to victory even in the difficult conditions in China¹s 
Liberated Areas with their total lack of outside aid, and the other 
leads to defeat even in the extremely favourable conditions in the 
Kuomintang areas with foreign aid available. 
The Kuomintang government attributes its failures to lack of arms. 
Yet one may ask, which of the two are short of arms, the Kuomintang 
troops or the troops of the Liberated Areas? Of all China¹s forces, 
those of the Liberated Areas lack arms most acutely, their only weapons 
being those they capture from the enemy or manufacture under 
the most adverse conditions. 
Is it not true that the forces directly under the Kuomintang central 
government are far better armed than the provincial troops? Yet in 
combat effectiveness most of the central forces are inferior to the 
provincial troops. 
The Kuomintang commands vast reserves of manpower, yet its 
wrong recruiting policy makes manpower replenishment very difficult. 
Though cut off from each other by the enemy and engaged in constant 
fighting, China¹s Liberated Areas are able to mobilize inexhaustible 
manpower because the militia and self-defence corps system, which 
is well-adapted to the needs of the people, is applied everywhere, and 
because misuse and waste of manpower are avoided. 
Although the Kuomintang controls vast areas abounding in grain 
and the people supply it with 70-100 million tan annually, its army 
is always short of food and its soldiers are emaciated because the

273 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
greater part of the grain is embezzled by those through whose hands 
it passes. But although most of China¹s Liberated Areas, which are 
located in the enemy rear, have been devastated by the enemy¹s policy 
of ³burn all, kill all, loot all², and although some regions like northern 
Shensi are very arid, we have successfully solved the grain problem 
through our own efforts by increasing agricultural production. 
The Kuomintang areas are facing a very grave economic crisis; 
most industries are bankrupt, and even such necessities as cloth have 
to be imported from the United States. But China¹s Liberated Areas 
are able to meet their own needs in cloth and other necessities through 
the development of industry. 
In the Kuomintang areas, the workers, peasants, shop assistants, 
government employees, intellectuals and cultural workers live in extreme 
misery. In the Liberated Areas all the people have food, clothing 
and work. 
It is characteristic of the Kuomintang areas that, exploiting the 
national crisis for profiteering purposes, officials have concurrently 
become traders and habitual grafters without any sense of shame or 
decency. It is characteristic of China¹s Liberated Areas that, setting 
an example of plain living and hard work, the cadres take part in 
production in addition to their regular duties; honesty is held in high 
esteem while graft is strictly prohibited. 
In the Kuomintang areas the people have no freedom at all. In 
China¹s Liberated Areas the people have full freedom. 
Who is to blame for all the anomalies which confront the Kuomintang 
rulers? Are others to blame, or they themselves? Are foreign 
countries to blame for not giving them enough aid, or are the Kuomintang 
government¹s dictatorial rule, corruption and incompetence 
to blame? Isn¹t the answer obvious? 
WHO IS ³SABOTAGING THE WAR OF RESISTANCE AND 
ENDANGERING THE STATE²? 
In the light of the indisputable evidence, is it not the Kuomintang 
government itself that has been sabotaging the Chinese people¹s War 
of Resistance and endangering our country? For fully ten years that 
government devoted itself wholly to civil war, turning the edge of 
its sword against the people while utterly neglecting national defence, 
and by its policy of non-resistance it gave away the four northeastern 
provinces. When the Japanese aggressors drove south of the Great

274 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Wall, it put up a flurry of resistance and then retreated from Lukouchiao 
all the way to the province of Kweichow. Yet the Kuomintang 
alleges that ³the Communist Party is sabotaging the War of Resistance 
and endangering the state² (see resolutions of the Eleventh Plenary 
Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, held 
in September 1943). Its only evidence is that the Communist Party has 
united with all sections of the people to create the Liberated Areas 
which are heroically resisting Japan. The logic of the Kuomintang is 
so different from that of the Chinese people that the failure to arrive 
at a common language on many problems is not to be wondered at. 
Here are two questions. 
First, what exactly has made the Kuomintang government abandon 
so vast and so well populated a territory, stretching from Heilungkiang 
Province to Lukouchiao and from Lukouchiao to Kweichow? Can 
it be anything other than its policy first of non-resistance and then 
of passive resistance to Japan, and its domestic policy of opposing 
the people? 
Second, what exactly has enabled China¹s Liberated Areas to 
smash the ruthless and prolonged attacks of the Japanese and puppet 
forces, to recover such vast territories and liberate such an immense 
population from the grip of the national enemy? Can it be anything 
other than our correct line, the line of a people¹s war? 
³DISOBEDIENCE TO GOVERNMENTAL AND MILITARY ORDERS² 
The Kuomintang government also constantly accuses the Chinese 
Communist Party of ³disobedience to governmental and military 
orders². All we need say is that fortunately the Chinese Communists, 
sharing the common sense of the Chinese people, have not obeyed 
such ³governmental and military orders² as in fact would have meant 
handing over to the Japanese aggressors the Liberated Areas which 
the Chinese people had recaptured from them amid great difficulties 
and hardships. Some examples are the ³Measures for Restricting the 
Activities of Alien Parties² in 1939, the orders for the ³disbandment 
of the New Fourth Army² and for its ³withdrawal north of the old 
course of the Yellow River² in 1941, the order for the ³dissolution of 
the Communist Party of China² in 1943, the order for us to ³disband 
all the troops except for ten divisions within a definite time limit² 
in 1944, and the proposal which the Kuomintang government called 
³a concession² in the recent talks with us and which would require us

275 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
to hand over our armed forces and local governments in exchange for 
a few posts in its dictatorial government, but without the formation 
of a coalition government. Fortunately we have not submitted to this 
sort of thing and have thus preserved an undefiled stretch of soil and 
a heroic anti-Japanese army for the Chinese people. Should not the 
Chinese people congratulate themselves on such ³disobedience²? Does 
not the Kuomintang government feel it has done enough after 
presenting the Japanese aggressors with the vast populated area from 
Heilungkiang to Kweichow through its own fascist government 
decrees and defeatist military orders? The Japanese aggressors and the 
reactionaries welcome these ³governmental and military orders², but 
can such things be welcomed by any upright Chinese patriot? Unless 
there is a coalition government, not in form but in fact, not a fascist 
dictatorship but a democratic government, is it conceivable that the 
Chinese people would permit the Chinese Communists to hand over 
the Liberated Areas where the people have won freedom as well as 
the people¹s armies that have performed signal service in the War of 
Resistance to the present Kuomintang government, which is defeatist, 
fascist and dictatorial? Without the Liberated Areas and the people¹s 
army, could the anti-Japanese cause of the Chinese people be what 
it is today? And can one possibly conceive what the future of the 
Chinese nation would be? 
THE DANGER OF CIVIL WAR 
To this day the chief ruling clique in the Kuomintang is persisting 
in its reactionary policy of dictatorship and civil war. There are many 
signs that it has long been making, and is now stepping up, preparations 
to unleash civil war as soon as the forces of a certain allied 
country have cleared a considerable part of the Chinese mainland of 
the Japanese aggressors. It also hopes that the generals of certain 
allied countries will do the same job in China as the British General 
Scobie5 has been doing in Greece. It applauds the butchery perpetrated 
by Scobie and the reactionary Greek government. It is planning to 
plunge China once again into the maelstrom of civil war, as in 1927-37. 
Behind the smokescreen of ³convening the national assembly² and 
³political settlement², it is secretly preparing civil war. If our fellowcountrymen 
fail to take note, fail to expose its schemes and put a 
stop to these preparations, then one fine morning they will hear the 
cannonade of civil war.

276 MAO TSE-TUNG 
NEGOTIATIONS 
After obtaining the consent of other democratic parties, the 
Communist Party of China put forward the demand at the People¹s 
Political Council in September 1944 that the Kuomintang one-party 
dictatorship be abolished immediately and a democratic coalition 
government be formed for the purpose of defeating the Japanese 
aggressors, building a new China and preventing civil war. This was 
undoubtedly a timely demand, and in the space of a few months it 
has won the warm response of the broad masses. 
We have had many rounds of negotiations with the Kuomintang 
government on the question of abolishing the one-party dictatorship, 
forming a coalition government and instituting essential democratic 
reforms, but it has rejected all our proposals. Not only is the Kuomintang 
unwilling to abolish the one-party dictatorship and form a 
coalition government, it is unwilling to introduce a single one of the 
urgently needed democratic reforms, such as the abolition of the secret 
police, the annulment of the reactionary laws and decrees that suppress 
the people¹s freedom, the release of political prisoners, recognition of 
the legal status of the political parties, recognition of the Liberated 
Areas and the withdrawal of the armies blockading and attacking them. 
Consequently political relations in China have become very strained. 
TWO PROSPECTS 
In the light of the situation as a whole and of the above analysis 
of the actual international and domestic state of affairs, I would ask 
everyone here to be on the alert and not to expect that our cause 
will proceed smoothly and easily. No, it will not. Actually there are 
two possibilities, two prospects, one good and one bad. One possibility 
or prospect is that the fascist dictatorship will continue and democratic 
reforms will not be allowed, that the stress will be on opposing the 
people instead of the Japanese aggressors, and even that civil war 
may break out after the Japanese aggressors are defeated, dragging 
China back into her old miserable state, without independence, freedom, 
democracy, unity, prosperity or strength. This possibility or 
prospect is still there, and it has not ceased to exist or has not automatically 
vanished simply because of the favourable international 
situation and the increased political consciousness and organized 
strength of our people. Those who hope that this possibility or prospect 
will become a reality in China are the reactionary clique within the

277 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
Kuomintang at home and the imperialist-minded reactionaries abroad. 
This is one aspect which must be taken into account. 
But there is another aspect and, again in the light of the situation 
as a whole and the foregoing analysis of the international and domestic 
state of affairs, we can gain added confidence and courage in striving 
for the second possibility or prospect. It is that of overcoming all 
difficulties, uniting the whole people, abolishing the Kuomintang¹s 
fascist dictatorship, carrying out democratic reforms, consolidating and 
expanding the anti-Japanese forces, thoroughly defeating the Japanese 
aggressors and building an independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous 
and powerful new China. Those who hope that this possibility 
or prospect will become a reality in China are the masses, the Communist 
Party and the other democratic parties at home, and all the nations 
that treat us as equals and the progressives and the masses abroad. 
We know full well that we Communists together with the whole 
Chinese people still face great difficulties and many obstacles and have 
a long and tortuous road to travel. But we know equally well that, 
together with the whole Chinese people, we shall overcome all the 
difficulties and obstacles and accomplish the task which history has 
entrusted China. The great task for us and for the whole people is to 
avert the first possibility or prospect and work for the second with 
every ounce of our energy. Essentially the international and domestic 
situation favours us Communists together with the Chinese people as 
a whole. This I have already made quite clear. We hope that the Kuomintang 
authorities will have the courage to change their present wrong 
policies in view of the general world trend and the popular feeling in 
China, so that the war can be won, the sufferings of the Chinese people 
can be reduced and a new China can soon be brought into being. It must 
be understood that, however tortuous the road, the Chinese people will 
certainly accomplish the task of achieving independence and liberation, 
and that the time has come for them to do so. It falls to our generation 
to fulfil the great aspirations cherished by countless martyrs in the past 
century, and any attempt to stop us will undoubtedly end in failure. 
IV. THE POLICY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY 
I have analysed the two lines in China¹s War of Resistance. Such 
an analysis is absolutely necessary. For up to this very moment many

278 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Chinese people still do not know what is really going on in this war. 
Many people in the Kuomintang areas and in foreign countries are 
being kept in the dark by the Kuomintang government¹s policy of 
blockade. They knew practically nothing about China¹s Liberated 
Areas until a group of Chinese and foreign correspondents came here 
in 1944 on a tour of observation. As soon as this group returned, the 
Kuomintang government, which was very much afraid of the true 
situation in the Liberated Areas becoming known outside, bolted the 
door and refused to let any other correspondent come here. Similarly 
it has suppressed the truth about the Kuomintang areas. Therefore I 
feel that we have the duty to give the public as much of the true picture 
of ³the two areas² as possible. Only when people see the whole situation 
in China clearly will they understand why there is such a difference 
in policy between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the two 
biggest political parties in China, and why there is such a struggle 
between the two lines. Only then will people understand that the 
dispute between the two parties is not an unnecessary or unimportant 
or merely captious dispute, as some have alleged, but is one of principle 
on which the lives of hundreds of millions of people depend. 
In China¹s present grave situation, the people, the democrats and 
democratic parties at home and the people in other countries who are 
concerned about the Chinese situation all hope that unity will replace 
disunity and that democratic reforms will be introduced, and they all 
want to know what the policy of the Chinese Communist Party is for 
solving the many vital problems of today. The members of our Party, 
of course, have a still deeper interest in these matters. 
Our policies of the Anti-Japanese National United Front in the 
war have always been clear and definite, and they have been tested 
in the eight years of war. Our congress should draw conclusions from 
them as a guide for our future struggles. 
Here I shall explain a number of the definite conclusions arrived 
at by our Party concerning the major policies for solving China¹s 
problems. 
OUR GENERAL PROGRAMME 
An agreed common programme is urgently needed by the Chinese 
people, the Chinese Communist Party and all the anti-Japanese 
democratic parties for the purpose of mobilizing and uniting all the 
anti-Japanese forces of the Chinese people, completely wiping out the

279 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
Japanese aggressors and building a new China that is independent, 
free, democratic, united, prosperous and powerful. 
Such a common programme may be divided into two parts, the 
general and the specific. Let us consider first the general and then the 
specific programme. 
On the major premise that the Japanese aggressors must be completely 
destroyed and a new China must be built, we Communists and 
the overwhelming majority of the population are agreed on the following 
fundamental propositions at the present stage of China¹s 
development. First, China should not have a feudal, fascist and antipopular 
state system under the dictatorship of the big landlords and 
big bourgeoisie, because eighteen years of government by the chief 
ruling clique of the Kuomintang have already proved its complete 
bankruptcy. Second, China cannot possibly establish the old type of 
democratic dictatorship  a purely national-bourgeois state  and 
therefore should not attempt to do so, because on the one hand the 
Chinese national bourgeoisie has proved itself very flabby economically 
and politically, and on the other, for a long time now a new factor has 
been present, namely, the awakened Chinese proletariat with its leader, 
the Chinese Communist Party, which has demonstrated great capacity 
in the political arena and assumed leadership of the peasant masses, 
the urban petty bourgeoisie, the intelligentsia and other democratic 
forces. Third, it is likewise impossible for the Chinese people to 
institute a socialist state system at the present stage when it is still 
their task to fight foreign and feudal oppression and the necessary 
social and economic conditions for a socialist state are still lacking. 
What then do we propose? We propose the establishment, after 
the thorough defeat of the Japanese aggressors, of a state system which 
we call New Democracy, namely, a united-front democratic alliance 
based on the overwhelming majority of the people, under the leadership 
of the working class. 
It is this kind of state system that truly meets the demands of the 
overwhelming majority of the Chinese population, because it can win 
and indeed has been winning the approval, first, of millions of 
industrial workers and tens of millions of handicraftsmen and farm 
labourers, second, of the peasantry, which constitutes 80 per cent of 
China¹s population, i.e., 360 million out of a population of 450 million, 
and third, of the large numbers of the urban petty bourgeoisie 
as well as the national bourgeoisie, the enlightened gentry and other 
patriots.

280 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Of course, there are still contradictions among these classes, notably 
the contradiction between labour and capital, and consequently each 
has its own particular demands. It would be hypocritical and wrong to 
deny the existence of these contradictions and differing demands. But 
throughout the stage of New Democracy, these contradictions, these 
differing demands; will not grow and transcend the demands which all 
have in common and should not be allowed to do so; they can be adjusted. 
Given such adjustment, these classes can together accomplish 
the political, economic and cultural tasks of the new-democratic state. 
The politics of New Democracy which we advocate consists in 
the overthrow of external oppression and of internal feudal and fascist 
oppression, and then the setting up not of the old type of democracy 
but of a political system which is a united front of all the democratic 
classes. These views of ours are completely in accord with the revolutionary 
views of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. In the Manifesto of the First 
National Congress of the Kuomintang, Dr. Sun wrote: 
The so-called democratic system in modern states is usually monopolized 
by the bourgeoisie and has become simply an instrument 
for oppressing the common people. On the other hand, the Kuomintang¹s 
Principle of Democracy means a democratic system shared 
by all the common people and not privately owned by the few. 
This is a great political injunction of Dr. Sun¹s. The Chinese people, 
the Chinese Communist Party and all other democrats must respect 
it, firmly put it into practice and wage a determined fight against all 
individuals and groups that violate or oppose it, and so defend and 
develop this perfectly correct political principle of New Democracy. 
The organizational principle of the new-democratic state should 
be democratic centralism, with the people¹s congresses determining the 
major policies and electing the governments at the various levels. It 
is at once democratic and centralized, that is, centralized on the basis 
of democracy and democratic under centralized guidance. This is the 
only system that can give full expression to democracy with full powers 
vested in the people¹s congresses at all levels and, at the same time, 
guarantee centralized administration with the governments at each 
level exercising centralized management of all the affairs entrusted to 
them by the people¹s congresses at the corresponding level and safeguarding 
whatever is essential to the democratic life of the people. 
The army and the other armed forces constitute an important part 
of the apparatus of the new-democratic state power, without which

281 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
the state cannot be defended. As with all other organs of power, the 
armed forces of the new-democratic state belong to the people and 
protect the people; they have nothing in common with the army, 
police, etc. of the old type which belong to the few and oppress the 
people. 
The economy of New Democracy which we advocate is likewise 
in accord with Dr. Sun¹s principles. On the land question, Dr. Sun 
championed ³land to the tiller². On the question of industry and commerce, 
Dr. Sun stated in the Manifesto quoted above: 
Enterprises, such as banks, railways and airlines, whether 
Chinese-owned or foreign-owned, which are either monopolistic in 
character or too big for private management, shall be operated and 
administered by the state, so that private capital cannot dominate 
the livelihood of the people: this is the main principle of the 
regulation of capital. 
In the present stage, we fully agree with these views of Dr. Sun¹s on 
economic questions. 
Some people suspect that the Chinese Communists are opposed to 
the development of individual initiative, the growth of private capital 
and the protection of private property, but they are mistaken. It is 
foreign oppression and feudal oppression that cruelly fetter the development 
of the individual initiative of the Chinese people, hamper the 
growth of private capital and destroy the property of the people. It 
is the very task of the New Democracy we advocate to remove these 
fetters and stop this destruction, to guarantee that the people can 
freely develop their individuality within the framework of society and 
freely develop such private capitalist economy as will benefit and not 
³dominate the livelihood of the people², and to protect all appropriate 
forms of private property. 
In accordance with Dr. Sun¹s principles and the experience of the 
Chinese revolution, China¹s national economy at the present stage 
should be composed of the state sector, the private sector and the 
co-operative sector. But the state here must certainly not be one 
³privately owned by the few², but a new-democratic state ³shared by 
all the common people² under the leadership of the proletariat. 
The culture of New Democracy should likewise be ³shared by all 
the common people², that is, it should be a national, scientific and 
mass culture, and must under no circumstances be a culture ³privately 
owned by the few².

282 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Such is the general or fundamental programme which we Communists 
advocate for the present stage, the entire stage of the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution. This is our minimum programme as 
against our future or maximum programme of socialism and communism. 
Its realization will carry the Chinese state and Chinese society 
a step forward, from a colonial, semi-colonial and semi-feudal to a 
new-democratic state and society. 
The political leadership of the proletariat and the proletarian-led 
state and co-operative sectors of the economy required by our programme 
are socialist factors. Yet the fulfilment of this programme will 
not turn China into a socialist society. 
We Communists do not conceal our political views. Definitely and 
beyond all doubt, our future or maximum programme is to carry China 
forward to socialism and communism. Both the name of our Party 
and our Marxist world outlook unequivocally point to this supreme 
ideal of the future, a future of incomparable brightness and splendour. 
On joining the Party, every Communist has two clearly-defined objectives 
at heart, the new-democratic revolution now and socialism and 
communism in the future, and for these he will fight despite the 
animosity of the enemies of communism and their vulgar and ignorant 
calumny, abuse and ridicule, which we must firmly combat. As for the 
well-meaning sceptics, we should explain things to them with goodwill 
and patience and not attack them. All this is very clear, definite and 
unequivocal. 
But all Communists and sympathizers with communism in China 
must struggle to achieve the objective of the present stage; they must 
struggle against foreign and feudal oppression to deliver the Chinese 
people from their miserable colonial, semi-colonial and semi-feudal 
plight and establish a proletarian-led new-democratic China whose 
main task is the liberation of the peasantry, a China of the revolutionary 
Three People¹s Principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, a China which 
is independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous and powerful. 
This is what we have actually been doing. Together with the masses 
of the Chinese people, we Communists have been fighting heroically 
for this objective for the past twenty-four years. 
If any Communist or Communist sympathizer talks about socialism 
and communism but fails to fight for this objective, if he belittles this 
bourgeois-democratic revolution, relaxes or slows down ever so slightly 
and shows the least disloyalty and coolness or is reluctant to shed his 
blood or give his life for it, then wittingly or unwittingly, such a person

283 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
is betraying socialism and communism to a greater or lesser extent 
and is certainly not a politically conscious and staunch fighter for communism. 
It is a law of Marxism that socialism can be attained only 
via the stage of democracy. And in China the fight for democracy is 
a protracted one. It would be a sheer illusion to try to build a socialist 
society on the ruins of the colonial, semi-colonial and semi-feudal 
order without a united new-democratic state, without the development 
of the state sector of the new-democratic economy, of the private 
capitalist and the co-operative sectors, and of a national, scientific and 
mass culture, i.e., a new-democratic culture, and without the liberation 
and the development of the individuality of hundreds of millions 
of people  in short, without a thoroughgoing bourgeois-democratic 
revolution of a new type led by the Communist Party. 
Some people fail to understand why, so far from fearing capitalism, 
Communists should advocate its development in certain given conditions. 
Our answer is simple. The substitution of a certain degree of 
capitalist development for the oppression of foreign imperialism and 
domestic feudalism is not only an advance but an unavoidable process.- 
It benefits the proletariat as well as the bourgeoisie, and the former 
perhaps more. It is not domestic capitalism but foreign imperialism 
and domestic feudalism which are superfluous in China today; indeed, 
we have too little of capitalism. Strangely enough, some spokesmen of 
the Chinese bourgeoisie fight shy of openly advocating the development 
of capitalism, but refer to it obliquely. There are other people 
who flatly deny that China should permit a necessary degree of capitalist 
development and who talk about reaching socialism in one stride 
and ³accomplishing at one stroke² the tasks of the Three People¹s 
Principles and socialism. Obviously, these opinions either reflect the 
weakness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie or are a demagogic trick 
on the part of the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie. From our 
knowledge of the Marxist laws of social development, we Communists 
clearly understand that under the state system of New Democracy in 
China it will be necessary in the interests of social progress to facilitate 
the development of the private capitalist sector of the economy (provided 
it does not dominate the livelihood of the people) besides the 
development of the state sector and of the individual and co-operative 
sectors run by the labouring people. We Communists will not let empty 
talk or deceitful tricks befuddle us. 
There are some people who doubt whether we Communists are 
sincere when we declare that ³the Three People¹s Principles being what

284 MAO TSE-TUNG 
China needs today, our Party is ready to fight for their complete 
realization². This is the result of their failure to understand that the 
basic tenets of the Three People¹s Principles, which Dr. Sun Yat-sen 
enunciated in the Manifesto of the First National Congress of the 
Kuomintang in 1924 and which we have accepted, coincide with certain 
basic tenets of our Party¹s programme for the present stage, that is, 
of our minimum programme. It should be pointed out that these Three 
People¹s Principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen coincide with our Party¹s programme 
for the present stage only in certain basic tenets and not in 
everything. Our Party¹s programme of New Democracy is of course 
much more comprehensive than Dr. Sun¹s principles, particularly as 
our Party¹s theory, programme and practice of New Democracy havegreatly 
developed with the development of the Chinese revolution inthe 
twenty years since Dr. Sun¹s death, and will develop still further. 
In essence, however, these Three People¹s Principles are a programme 
of New Democracy, as distinguished from the previous, old Three 
People¹s Principles; naturally they are ³what China needs today² and 
naturally ³our Party is ready to fight for their complete realization². 
To us Chinese Communists, the struggle for our Party¹s minimum 
programme and the struggle for Dr. Sun¹s revolutionary, or new, Three 
People¹s Principles are basically (though not in every respect) one and 
the same thing. Therefore, as in the past and the present, the Chinese 
Communists will prove to be the most sincere and thoroughgoing 
executors of the revolutionary Three People¹s Principles in the future 
as well. 
Some people are suspicious and think that once in power, the 
Communist Party will follow Russia¹s example and establish the dictatorship 
of the proletariat and a one-party system. Our answer is that 
a new-democratic state based on an alliance of the democratic classes 
is different in principle from a socialist state under the dictatorship 
of the proletariat. Beyond all doubt, our system of New Democracy 
will be built under the leadership of the proletariat and of the Communist 
Party, but throughout the stage of New Democracy China 
cannot possibly have a one-class dictatorship and one-party government 
and therefore should not attempt it. We have no reason for 
refusing to co-operate with all political parties, social groups and 
individuals, provided their attitude to the Communist Party is cooperative 
and not hostile. The Russian system has been shaped by 
Russian history; in Russia the exploitation of man by man has been 
abolished as a social system, the political, economic and cultural

285 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
system of the newest type of democracy, i.e., socialism, has been put 
into effect, and the people support the Bolshevik Party alone, having 
discarded all the anti-socialist parties. All this has shaped the Russian 
system, which is perfectly necessary and reasonable there. But even in 
Russia, where the Bolshevik Party is the sole political party, the 
system practised in the organs of state power is still one of an alliance 
of workers, peasants and intellectuals and an alliance of Party members 
and non-Party people, and not a system in which the working class 
and the Bolsheviks alone may work in the organs of government. The 
Chinese system for the present stage is being shaped by the present stage 
of Chinese history, and for a long time to come there will exist a special 
form of state and political power, a form that is distinguished from 
the Russian system but is perfectly necessary and reasonable for us, 
namely, the new-democratic form of state and political power based 
on the alliance of the democratic classes. 
OUR SPECIFIC PROGRAMME 
Our Party must also have a specific programme for each period 
based on this general programme. Our general programme of New 
Democracy will remain unchanged throughout the stage of the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution, that is, for several decades. But from 
phase to phase during this stage, conditions have changed or are changing 
and it is only natural that we have to change our specific programme 
accordingly. For example, our general programme of New Democracy 
has remained the same throughout the periods of the Northern Expedition, 
the Agrarian Revolutionary War and the War of Resistance 
Against Japan, but there have been changes in our specific programme 
because our friends and enemies have not remained the same in the 
three periods. 
The Chinese people now find themselves in the following 
situation: 
(1) the Japanese aggressors have not yet been defeated; 
(2) the Chinese people urgently need to work together for a 
democratic change in order to achieve national unity, rapidly 
mobilize and unite all anti-Japanese forces, and defeat the Japanese 
aggressors in co-operation with the allies; and 
(3) the Kuomintang government is disrupting national unity 
and obstructing such a democratic change.

286 MAO TSE-TUNG 
What is our specific programme in the circumstances or, in other words, 
what are the immediate demands of the people? 
We consider the following to be appropriate and minimum 
demands: 
Mobilize all available forces for the thorough defeat of the 
Japanese aggressors and the establishment of international peace 
in co-operation with the allies; 
Abolish the Kuomintang one-party dictatorship and establish 
a democratic coalition government and a joint supreme command; 
Punish the pro-Japanese elements, fascists and defeatists who 
are opposing the people and disrupting national unity, and so help 
to build national unity; 
Punish the reactionaries who are creating the danger of civil 
war, and so help to ensure internal peace; 
Punish the traitors, take punitive action against officers who 
surrender to the enemy, and punish the agents of the Japanese; 
Liquidate the reactionary secret service and all its repressive 
activities and abolish the concentration camps; 
Revoke all reactionary laws and decrees aimed at suppressing 
the people¹s freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, political 
conviction and religious belief and freedom of the person, and 
guarantee full civil rights to the people; 
Recognize the legal status of all democratic parties and groups; 
Release all patriotic political prisoners; 
Withdraw all troops encircling and attacking China¹s Liberated 
Areas and dispatch them to the anti-Japanese front; 
Recognize the anti-Japanese armed forces and popularly elected 
governments of China¹s Liberated Areas; 
Consolidate and expand the Liberated Areas and their armed 
forces, and recover all lost territory; 
Help the people in the Japanese-occupied areas to organize 
underground armed forces for armed uprisings; 
Allow the Chinese people to arm themselves and defend their 
homes and their country; 
Bring about the political and military transformation of those 
armies directly under the Kuomintang supreme command, which 
constantly lose battles, oppress the people and discriminate against 
armies not directly under it, and punish the commanders who are 
responsible for disastrous defeats;

287 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
Improve the recruiting system and the living conditions of the 
officers and men; 
Give preferential treatment to the families of the soldiers 
fighting in the anti-Japanese war, so that the officers and men at 
the front are free from domestic worries; 
Provide preferential treatment for disabled soldiers and for the 
families of the soldiers who give their lives for the country, and 
help demobilized soldiers to settle down and earn a living; 
Develop war industries to facilitate the prosecution of the 
war;
Distribute the military and financial aid received from the 
allies impartially to all the armies fighting in the War of Resistance; 
Punish corrupt officials and institute clean government; 
Improve the pay of the middle and lower grade government 
employees; 
Give the Chinese people democratic rights; 
Abolish the oppressive pao-chia system;6 
Provide the war refugees and the victims of natural disasters 
with relief; 
Appropriate substantial funds after the recovery of China¹s 
lost territory for the extensive relief of people who have suffered 
under enemy occupation; 
Abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and establish 
a consolidated progressive tax; 
Introduce rural reforms, reduce rent and interest, provide 
suitable safeguards for the rights of tenants, grant low-interest 
loans to impoverished peasants and help the peasants to organize, 
in order to facilitate the expansion of agricultural production; 
Outlaw bureaucrat-capital; 
Abolish the present policy of economic controls; 
Check the unbridled inflation and rocketing prices; 
Assist private industry and provide it with facilities for 
obtaining loans, purchasing raw materials and marketing its 
products; 
Improve the livelihood of the workers, provide relief for the 
unemployed and help the workers to organize, in order to facilitate 
the expansion of industrial production; 
Abolish Kuomintang indoctrination in education and promote 
a national, scientific and mass culture and education;

288 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Guarantee the livelihood of the teachers and other staff members 
of educational institutions and guarantee academic freedom; 
Protect the interests of the youth, women and children  provide 
assistance to young student refugees, help the youth and 
women to organize in order to participate on an equal footing in 
all work useful to the war effort and to social progress, ensure 
freedom of marriage and equality as between men and women, 
and give young people and children a useful education; 
Give the minority nationalities in China better treatment and 
grant them autonomous rights; 
Protect the interests of the overseas Chinese and assist those who 
have returned to the motherland; 
Protect foreign nationals who have fled to China from the 
Japanese oppression and support their struggle against the Japanese 
aggressors; 
Improve Sino-Soviet relations. 
To achieve these demands, the most important thing is the immediate 
abolition of the Kuomintang one-party dictatorship and the establishment 
of a democratic provisional central government, a coalition 
government enjoying nation-wide support and including representatives 
of all the anti-Japanese parties and people without party affiliation. 
Without this prerequisite it is impossible to make any genuine 
change in the Kuomintang areas, and therefore in the country as 
a whole. 
These demands voice the desires of the Chinese masses and 
also of broad sections of democratic public opinion in the allied 
countries. 
A minimum specific programme which is agreed upon by all the 
anti-Japanese democratic parties is absolutely indispensable, and we 
are prepared to consult with them on the basis of the programme outlined 
above. Different parties may have different demands, but all 
should reach agreement on a common programme. 
As far as the Kuomintang areas are concerned, such a programme 
is still at the stage of being a demand of the people; as far as the 
Japanese-occupied areas are concerned, it is a programme whose fulfilment 
must await their recovery, except for the item on the organization 
of underground forces for armed uprisings; as far as the Liberated 
Areas are concerned, it is a programme which has already been, is 
being and should continue to be, put into practice.

289 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
The immediate demands or specific programme of the Chinese people 
outlined above involve many vital war-time and post-war problems 
which require further elucidation. In explaining these problems below 
we shall criticize some of the wrong viewpoints held by the chief ruling 
clique of the Kuomintang and at the same time answer some questions 
raised by other people. 
1. Destroy the Japanese Aggressors Completely, 
Allow No Compromise Halfway 
The Cairo conference7 rightly decided that the Japanese aggressors 
must be made to surrender unconditionally. But the Japanese aggressors 
are now working behind the scenes for a compromise peace, while the 
pro-Japanese elements in the Kuomintang government are hitching 
up with Japan¹s secret emissaries through the Nanking puppet government, 
and no stop has been put to this. Hence the danger of a halfway 
compromise is not yet entirely over. The Cairo conference made 
another good decision, namely, that the four northeastern provinces,- 
Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China. But, 
given its present policies, the Kuomintang government cannot possibly 
be relied upon to fight all the way to the Yalu River and recover all 
our lost territory. What should the Chinese people do in these circumstances? 
They should demand that the Kuomintang government 
should destroy the Japanese aggressors completely and allow no compromise 
halfway. All intrigues for a compromise must immediately 
be stopped. The Chinese people should demand that the Kuomintang 
government should change its present policy of passive resistance and 
employ all its military strength in active warfare against Japan. They 
should expand their own armed forces  the Eighth Route Army, 
the New Fourth Army and the other armed units of the people  and 
on their own initiative develop anti-Japanese armed forces on an 
extensive scale wherever the enemy has reached, and they should prepare 
to recover all the lost territory by fighting in direct co-operation 
with the allies; under no circumstances must they place their reliance 
solely on the Kuomintang. It is the sacred right of the Chinese people 
to defeat the Japanese aggressors. If the reactionaries try to deprive 
them of this right, suppress their anti-Japanese activities or undermine 
their strength, then the Chinese people should firmly strike back in 
self-defence if persuasion proves unavailing. For such acts of national 
treachery on the part of the Chinese reactionaries only aid and abet 
the Japanese aggressors.

2. Abolish the Kuomintang One-Party Dictatorship, 
Establish a Democratic Coalition Government 
To wipe out the Japanese aggressors it is necessary to effect democratic 
reforms throughout the country. Yet this will be impossible 
unless the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang is abolished and 
a democratic coalition government is established. 
The one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang is in reality the 
dictatorship of the anti-popular clique within the Kuomintang, and 
this dictatorship is the disruptor of China¹s national unity, the author 
of the defeats on the Kuomintang front in the war, and the basic 
obstacle to the mobilization and unification of the anti-Japanese forces 
of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have become fully aware 
of the evils of this dictatorship through eight years of bitter experience 
in the War of Resistance, and they naturally demand its immediate 
abolition. This reactionary dictatorship is also the breeder of civil 
war and, unless it is immediately abolished, it will again bring the 
calamity of civil war upon them. 
So widespread and resounding is the outcry of the Chinese people 
for the abolition of the anti-popular dictatorship that the Kuomintang 
authorities themselves have been forced to agree publicly to the ³earlier 
termination of political tutelage², which shows how far this ³political 
tutelage² or one-party dictatorship has forfeited popular support and 
prestige. There is not a single person in China who still dares to assert 
that ³political tutelage² or one-party dictatorship is any good or that 
it should not be abolished or ³terminated², and that marks a great 
change in the situation. 
It is definite and beyond all doubt that it should be ³terminated². 
But opinions differ as to how to do it. Some say, terminate it at once 
and establish a provisional democratic coalition government. Others 
say, wait a bit, convene the ³national assembly², and ³hand state 
power back to the people² and not to a coalition government. 
What does this mean? 
It means there are two ways of doing things, the honest way and 
the dishonest way. 
First, the honest way. The honest way is immediately to proclaim 
the abolition of the Kuomintang one-party dictatorship, to establish 
a provisional central government composed of representatives of the 
Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Democratic League and 
people with no party affiliation, and to promulgate a democratic

291 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
programme of political action such as the immediate demands of the 
Chinese people which we have set forth above, with the aim of restoring 
national unity and defeating the Japanese aggressors. A roundtable 
conference of the representatives of the various parties and 
people with no party affiliation should be convened to discuss and 
reach agreement on these matters, and action should then be taken 
accordingly. This is the road of unity, which the Chinese people will 
firmly support. 
Second, the dishonest way. The dishonest way is to disregard the 
demands of the masses and of all the democratic parties and to insist 
on convening a so-called national assembly stage-managed by the antipopular 
clique in the Kuomintang and have it adopt a ³constitution² 
which in practice will be anti-democratic and will buttress the dictatorship 
of this clique, for the purpose of providing a cloak of legality for 
an illegal ³National Government²  a government formed privately 
through the appointment of a few dozen Kuomintang members, imposed 
on the people and utterly devoid of any foundation in the popular 
will  thus making a pretence of ³handing state power back to the 
people² while actually ³handing it back² to the selfsame reactionary 
clique within the Kuomintang. Whoever disapproves will be accused 
of sabotaging ³democracy² and ³unity², which will then be a ³reason² 
for ordering punitive action against him. This is the road of disruption, 
which the Chinese people will firmly oppose. 
The steps our reactionary heroes are preparing to take in line with 
this splitting policy will probably lead them to destruction. They are 
putting a noose round their own necks and fastening it there, and this 
noose is the ³national assembly². Their intention is to use the ³national 
assembly² as a magic weapon, first, to prevent the formation of a 
coalition government, second, to maintain their dictatorship, and third, 
to prepare a justification of civil war. However, the logic of history 
runs counter to their wishes, and they will be ³lifting a rock only to 
drop it on their own toes². For it is now obvious to all that the people 
in the Kuomintang areas have no freedom and the people in the 
Japanese-occupied areas cannot take part in elections, while the 
Liberated Areas which have freedom are not recognized by the Kuomintang 
government. Such being the case, how can there be national 
delegates? How can there be a ³national assembly²? The national 
assembly they are clamouring for is the one the Kuomintang dictatorship 
rigged up in every detail eight years ago during the civil war 
period. If such an assembly is convened, the whole nation will inevitably

292 MAO TSE-TUNG 
rise up against it, and how, it may be asked, will our reactionary heroes 
get out of that predicament? All in all, the convening of the bogus 
national assembly will only lead them to destruction. 
We Communists propose two steps for the termination of the Kuomintang 
one-party dictatorship. First, at the present stage, to establish 
a provisional coalition government through common agreement among 
representatives of all parties and people with no party affiliation. 
Second, in the next stage, to convene a national assembly after free 
and unrestricted elections and form a regular coalition government. 
In both cases there will be a coalition government in which the representatives 
of all classes and political parties willing to take part are 
united on a democratic common programme in the fight against Japan 
today and for national construction tomorrow. 
This is the only course China can take, whatever the intentions of 
the Kuomintang or other parties, groups or individuals, whether they 
like it or not, and whether or not they are conscious of it. This is a 
historical law, an inexorable trend which no force can reverse. 
On this and all other problems of democratic reform, we Communists 
declare that although the Kuomintang authorities are still 
stubbornly persisting in their wrong policies and using negotiations to 
play for time and allay public opinion, we are ready to resume negotiations 
with them the moment they show willingness to renounce their 
present wrong policies and agree to democratic reforms. But the 
negotiations must be based on the general principle of resistance, unity 
and democracy, and we will not agree to any so-called measures, 
plans or empty pronouncements that depart from this general principle, 
however pleasing they may sound. 
3. Freedom for the People 
At present the Chinese people¹s struggle for freedom is primarily 
directed against the Japanese aggressors. But the Kuomintang government 
is preventing them from fighting the Japanese aggressors by 
depriving them of their freedom and binding them hand and foot. 
Unless this problem is solved, it will be impossible to mobilize and 
unify all the anti-Japanese forces of the nation. It is precisely to untie 
the people¹s bonds so that they can have the freedom to resist Japan, 
to unite and to win democracy that our programme puts forward such 
demands as the abolition of the one-party dictatorship; the establishment 
of a coalition government; the liquidation of the secret police; 
the revocation of repressive laws and decrees; the punishment of

293 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
traitors, spies, pro-Japanese elements, fascists and corrupt officials; 
the release of political prisoners; the recognition of the legal status 
of all the democratic parties; the withdrawal of troops encircling or 
attacking the Liberated Areas; the recognition of the Liberated Areas; 
the abolition of the pao-chia system; and the many other demands 
relating to the economy, culture and the mass movement. 
Freedom is won by the people through struggle, it is not bestowed 
by anyone as a favour. The people in China¹s Liberated Areas have 
already won freedom, and the people can and must win freedom in 
the other areas too. The greater the freedom of the Chinese people 
and the stronger their organized democratic forces, the greater the 
possibility of forming a provisional and unified coalition government. 
Once formed, this coalition government will in its turn provide full 
freedom for the people and so consolidate its own foundations. Only 
then will it be possible to hold free and unrestricted elections throughout 
the land after the overthrow of the Japanese aggressors, to create 
a democratic national assembly and to establish a regular and unified 
coalition government. Unless the people have freedom, there can be 
no national assembly or government genuinely elected by the people. 
Is this not clear enough? 
Freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, political conviction 
and religious belief and freedom of the person are the people¹s most 
important freedoms. In China only the Liberated Areas have given 
full effect to these freedoms. 
In 1925 Dr. Sun Yat-sen declared in his deathbed Testament: 
For forty years I have devoted myself to the cause of the 
national revolution with the aim of winning freedom and equality 
for China. My experience during these forty years has firmly convinced 
me that to achieve this aim we must arouse the masses 
of the people and unite in a common fight with those nations of the 
world who treat us as equals. 
The unworthy successors of Dr. Sun, who have betrayed him, oppress 
the masses of the people instead of arousing them, and deprive them 
of all their freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, political 
conviction and religious belief and freedom of the person. They attach 
the labels ³traitor party², ³traitor army², and ³traitor areas² to the 
Communist Party, the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies and the 
Liberated Areas, which are all genuinely arousing the masses of the 
people and protecting their freedoms and rights. We hope that there

294 MAO TSE-TUNG 
will soon be an end to this reversal of right and wrong. If it lasts much 
longer, the Chinese people will lose all patience. 
4. Unity of the People 
It is imperative to turn a divided China into a united China in 
order to destroy the Japanese aggressors, prevent civil war and build 
a new China; such is the historical task of the Chinese people. 
But how is China to be united? Through autocratic unification by 
a dictator or democratic unification by the people? From the time of 
Yuan Shih-kai8 the Northern warlords concentrated on autocratic 
unification. But what was the result? Contrary to their desires, what 
they obtained was not unification but division, and finally they tumbled 
from power. Following in Yuan Shih-kai¹s footsteps, the anti-popular 
clique of the Kuomintang sought autocratic unification and waged 
civil war for fully ten years, only to let in the Japanese aggressors 
while they themselves withdrew to Mount Omei.9 And now from their 
mountain top they are again shouting about their theory of autocratic 
unification. To whom are they shouting? Will any upright patriotic 
Chinese listen to them? Having lived through sixteen years of Northern 
warlord rule and eighteen years of dictatorial Kuomintang rule, the 
people have acquired ample experience and discerning eyes. They want 
democratic unification by the masses and not autocratic unification 
by a dictator. As early as 1935, we Communists put forward the policy 
of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, and we have fought for 
it ever since. In 1939, when the Kuomintang was enforcing its reactionary 
³Measures for Restricting the Activities of Alien Parties², thus creating 
the imminent danger of capitulation, split and retrogression, and 
when it was shouting about its theory of autocratic unification, we again 
declared: There must be unification based on resistance and not on 
capitulation, on unity and not on splitting, on progress and not on 
retrogression. Only unification based on resistance, unity and progress 
is genuine and any other kind would be a sham. Six years have passed, 
but the issue remains the same. 
Can there be unity if the people have no freedom or democracy? 
There will be unity as soon as they have both. The Chinese people¹s 
movement for freedom, democracy and a coalition government is at 
the same time a movement for unity. When we put forward many 
demands for freedom, democracy and a coalition government in our 
specific programme, we are at the same time aiming at unity. It is 
plain common sense that unless the dictatorship of the anti-popular

295 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
Kuomintang clique is abolished and a democratic coalition government 
is formed, not only will it be impossible to carry out any democratic 
reform in the Kuomintang areas or to mobilize the armies and 
the people there for the defeat of the Japanese aggressors, but the 
calamity of civil war will ensue. Why do so many democrats, with 
and without party affiliation, including many in the Kuomintang, 
unanimously demand a coalition government? Because they are clearly 
aware of the present crisis and realize that there is no other way to 
overcome it and achieve both unity against the enemy and unity for 
national construction. 
5. The People¹s Army 
Without an army standing on the people¹s side, it is impossible 
for the Chinese people to win freedom and unification, establish a 
coalition government, thoroughly defeat the Japanese aggressors and 
build a new China. At present the only armed forces that stand wholly 
on the people¹s side are the Liberated Areas¹ Eighth Route and New 
Fourth Armies, which are not very large; they are far from sufficient. 
Yet the Kuomintang group which opposes the people is ceaselessly 
intriguing to undermine and destroy the armies of the Liberated 
Areas. In 1944 the Kuomintang government presented a so-called 
memorandum demanding that the Communist Party should ³disband, 
within a definite time limit², four-fifths of the armed forces of the 
Liberated Areas. In 1945, during the most recent negotiations, it has 
further demanded the handing over of all the armed forces of the 
Liberated Areas by the Communist Party, after which it would grant 
the Communist Party ³legal status². 
These people tell the Communists, ³Hand over your troops and 
we will grant you freedom.² According to their theory, a political party 
that does not have any army should enjoy freedom. Yet whatever freedom 
the Chinese Communist Party enjoyed during 1924-27, when it 
had only a small armed force, vanished with the Kuomintang government¹s 
policies of ³party purge² and massacre. And today, the China 
Democratic League and the democrats within the Kuomintang, who 
have no armed forces, have no freedom either. Let us take the workers, 
peasants and students and the progressively- inclined people in 
cultural, educational and industrial circles under the Kuomintang 
regime  for the last eighteen years none of them have had any armed 
forces, and none of them have had any freedom. Can it be that 
all these democratic parties and people have been denied freedom

296 MAO TSE-TUNG 
because they organized armies, perpetrated ³feudal separatism², 
created ³traitor areas² and violated ³governmental and military 
orders²? Not in the least. On the contrary, they have been denied 
freedom precisely because they have done none of these things. 
³The army belongs to the state²  that is perfectly true, and there 
is not an army in the world that does not belong to a state. But what 
kind of state? A state under the feudal and fascist dictatorship of the 
big landlords, big bankers and big compradors, or a new-democratic 
state of the broad masses of the people? The only kind of state for 
China to establish is a new-democratic state and, on this basis, she 
should establish a new-democratic coalition government; all the 
armed forces of China must belong to such a government of such a 
state so that they may safeguard the people¹s freedom and effectively 
fight foreign aggressors. The moment a new-democratic coalition government 
comes into being in China, the Liberated Areas of China will 
hand their armed forces over to it. But all the Kuomintang armed 
forces will have to be handed over to it at the same time. 
In 1924 Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, ³Today should mark the beginning 
of a new epoch in the national revolution. . . . The first step is to unite 
the armed forces with the people, and the next step is to turn them 
into the armed forces of the people.²10 It is because they have applied 
this policy that the Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies have 
become ³the armed forces of the people², that is, the people¹s army, 
and have been able to win victories. During the earlier period of the 
Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang armies took Dr. Sun¹s ³first 
step², and hence won victories. In the latter period of the Northern 
Expedition they abandoned even the ³first step², took a stand against 
the people, and hence from that time right down to the present they 
have become more and more corrupt and degenerate; in their element 
when fighting internal war, they cannot but be out of their element 
when it comes to fighting external war. Every patriotic officer in 
the Kuomintang army who has a conscience should set about reviving 
the Sun Yat-sen spirit and transforming his troops. 
In the work of transforming the old armies, a suitable education 
should be given to all officers who are capable of being reeducated 
to help them to get rid of their obsolete outlook and acquire 
a correct outlook, so that they can remain and serve in the people¹s 
army. 
It is the duty of the whole nation to struggle for the creation of 
the army of the Chinese people. Without a people¹s army the people

297 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
have nothing. On this question there must be no empty theorizing 
whatsoever. 
We Communists are ready to give our support to the task of transforming 
the Chinese army. All those military forces which are willing 
to unite with the people and to oppose the Japanese aggressors instead 
of opposing the armed forces of the Chinese Liberated Areas should 
be regarded as friendly troops and be given proper assistance by the 
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies. 
6. The Land Problem 
To wipe out the Japanese aggressors and build a new China, it is 
imperative to reform the land system and emancipate the peasants. 
Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s thesis of ³land to the tiller² is correct for the present 
period of our revolution, which is bourgeois-democratic in nature. 
Why do we say our revolution in the present period is bourgeoisdemocratic 
in nature? We mean that the target of this revolution is 
not the bourgeoisie in general but national and feudal oppression, that 
the measures taken in this revolution are in general directed not at 
abolishing but at protecting private property, and that as a result of 
this revolution the working class will be able to build up the strength 
to lead China in the direction of socialism, though capitalism will still 
be enabled to grow to an appropriate extent for a fairly long period. 
³Land to the tiller² means transferring the land from the feudal 
exploiters to the peasants, turning the private property of the feudal 
landlords into the private property of the peasants and emancipating 
them from feudal agrarian relations, thereby making possible the 
transformation of an agricultural country into an industrial country. 
Thus, ³land to the tiller² is in the nature of a bourgeois-democratic 
and not a proletarian-socialist demand; it is the demand of all revolutionary 
democrats and not the demand of us Communists alone. The 
difference is that, in China¹s circumstances, we Communists alone treat 
this demand with special seriousness, and do not just talk about it but 
put it into practice. Who are the revolutionary democrats? Apart from 
the proletariat who are the most thoroughgoing of the revolutionary 
democrats, the peasants form by far the largest group. The overwhelming 
majority of the peasants, that is, all except the rich peasants who 
have a feudal tail, actively demand ³land to the tiller². The urban petty 
bourgeoisie are also revolutionary democrats and ³land to the tiller² 
will prove to be to their advantage as well, for it will help to develop 
the productive forces in agriculture. The national bourgeoisie are a

298 MAO TSE-TUNG 
vacillating class  they also approve of ³land to the tiller² because 
they need markets, but many of them are afraid of it because for the 
most part they have ties with landed property. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was 
the earliest revolutionary democrat in China. Representing the revolutionary 
section of the national bourgeoisie as well as the urban petty 
bourgeoisie and the peasants, he carried out an armed revolution and 
put forward his thesis of ³equalization of landownership² and ³land 
to the tiller². But unfortunately he did not take the initiative and reform 
the land system when he was in power. And when the anti-popular 
clique of the Kuomintang took power, it completely betrayed what 
he stood for. It is this clique that is now stubbornly opposing ³land to 
the tiller² because it represents the stratum of big landlords, bankers 
and compradors. As China has no political party exclusively representing 
the peasants and the political parties of the national bourgeoisie 
have no thoroughgoing land programme, the Chinese Communist Party 
has become the leader of the peasants and all the other revolutionary 
democrats, being the only party that has formulated and carried out 
a thoroughgoing land programme, fought earnestly for the peasants¹ 
interests and therefore won the overwhelming majority of the peasants 
as its great ally. 
From 1927 to 1936, the Chinese Communist Party adopted various 
measures for the thorough reform of the land system and put Dr. Sun¹s 
³land to the tiller² into effect. It was precisely the reactionary clique 
of the Kuomintang, that gang of unworthy followers of Dr. Sun 
Yat-sen, who bared their teeth, showed their claws and fought against 
³land to the tiller² in ten years of war against the people. 
The Communist Party has made a major concession in the anti- 
Japanese war period by changing the policy of ³land to the tiller² to 
one of reducing rent and interest. This concession is a correct one, for 
it helped to bring the Kuomintang into the war against Japan and 
lessened the resistance of the landlords in the Liberated Areas to 
our mobilization of the peasants for the war. If no special obstacle 
arises, we are prepared to continue this policy after the war, first 
extending rent and interest reduction to the whole country and then 
taking proper measures for the gradual achievement of ³land to 
the tiller². 
However, those who have betrayed Dr. Sun oppose the reduction 
of rent and interest, let alone ³land to the tiller². The Kuomintang 
government has not carried out the decree for a ³25 per cent reduction 
in rent² and similar decrees which it has promulgated itself; only we

299 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
in the Liberated Areas have enforced them, and for this crime the 
Liberated Areas have been labelled ³traitor areas². 
In the course of the anti-Japanese war a so-called theory of two 
stages, a stage of ³national revolution² and a stage of ³revolution for 
democracy and the people¹s livelihood², has made its appearance. 
This theory is wrong. 
³Faced with a formidable enemy, we should not raise the question 
of democratic reforms or the people¹s livelihood; better wait until the 
Japanese are gone²  such is the absurd theory put forward by the 
reactionary clique of the Kuomintang for the purpose of preventing 
complete victory in the war. Yet there are people who have been 
echoing this theory and have become its servile adherents. 
³Faced with a formidable enemy, it is impossible for us to build 
up bases against the Japanese and resist their attacks unless we settle 
the question of democracy and the people¹s livelihood²  this is what 
the Chinese Communist Party has been advocating and, moreover, has 
already put into practice with excellent results. 
In the period of the anti-Japanese war, reduction of rent and 
interest and the other democratic reforms all serve the war. In order 
to lessen the landlords¹ resistance to the war effort we have abstained 
from abolishing their ownership of land and have only reduced rent 
and interest; at the same time, we have encouraged them to transfer 
their assets to industry and given the enlightened gentry the opportunity 
to take part in public activities for the war and in the work of 
government alongside other representatives of the people. As for the 
rich peasants, we have encouraged them to develop production. All 
this is part of the resolute line of democratic reforms in the rural areas 
and is absolutely necessary. 
There are two lines. Either stubbornly oppose the Chinese peasants¹ 
endeavour to settle the problem of democracy and the people¹s 
livelihood, and become corrupt, ineffectual and utterly incapable of 
fighting Japan; or firmly support the Chinese peasants in their endeavour, 
and gain the greatest of allies, constituting 80 per cent of the 
population, thereby forging tremendous fighting strength. The former 
is the line of the Kuomintang government, the latter is the line of 
China¹s Liberated Areas. 
The line of the opportunists is to vacillate between the two, to 
profess support for the peasants and yet lack the resolve to reduce rent 
and interest, arm the peasants or establish democratic political power 
in the rural areas.

300 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Using all the forces at its command, the anti-popular clique of the 
Kuomintang has directed every kind of vicious attack, open and secret 
military and political, both with bloodshed and without, against the 
Chinese Communist Party. Taken in its social setting, the dispute 
between the two parties is essentially over this issue of agrarian 
relations. Where exactly did we give offence to the Kuomintang reactionary 
clique? Is it not on this score? Has it not been precisely by 
rendering the Japanese aggressors great help on this score that this 
clique has won favour and encouragement from them? Have not all 
the charges against the Chinese Communist Party  ³sabotaging the 
War of Resistance and endangering the state², ³traitor party², ³traitor 
army², ³traitor areas², and ³disobedience to governmental and military 
orders²  been levelled precisely because it has done conscientious 
work in the true interests of the nation in this sphere? 
It is the peasants who are the source of China¹s industrial workers. 
In the future, additional tens of millions of peasants will go to the 
cities and enter factories. If China is to build up powerful national 
industries and many large modern cities, there will have to be a long 
process of transformation of rural into urban inhabitants. 
It is the peasants who constitute the main market for China¹s 
industry. Only they can supply foodstuffs and raw materials in great 
abundance and absorb manufactured goods in great quantities. 
It is the peasants who are the source of the Chinese army. The 
soldiers are peasants in military uniform, the mortal enemies of the 
Japanese aggressors. 
It is the peasants who are the main political force for democracy 
in China at the present stage. Chinese democrats will achieve nothing 
unless they rely on the support of the 360 million peasants. 
It is the peasants who are the chief concern of China¹s cultural 
movement at the present stage. If the 360 million peasants are left 
out, do not the ³elimination of illiteracy², ³popularization of education², 
³literature and art for the masses² and ³public health² become 
largely empty talk? 
In saying this, I am of course not ignoring the political, economic 
and cultural importance of the rest of the people numbering about 90 
million, and in particular am not ignoring the working class, which is 
politically the most conscious and therefore qualified to lead the whole 
revolutionary movement. Let there be no misunderstanding. 
It is absolutely necessary not only for Communists but for every 
democrat in China to grasp these points.

301 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
When there is reform of the land system  even such an elementary 
reform as reduction of rent and interest  the peasants become 
more interested in production. Then as the peasants are helped to 
organize farming and other co-operatives step by step on a voluntary 
basis, the productive forces will grow. The farming co-operatives at 
present can only be collective, mutual-aid labour organizations based 
on an individual peasant economy (i.e., on private ownership by the 
peasants), such as labour-exchange teams, mutual-aid teams and workexchange 
groups; even so the increase in labour productivity and 
output is already astonishing. Such organizations have been widely 
developed in China¹s Liberated Areas and from now on should be 
spread as much as possible. 
It might be mentioned that co-operative organization of the labourexchange 
team type has existed among the peasants for a long time, 
but in the past it was only a means by which they tried to alleviate 
their wretchedness. Today the labour-exchange teams in China¹s 
Liberated Areas are different both in form and in content; they have 
become a means by which the peasant masses increase production and 
strive for a better life. 
In the last analysis, the impact, good or bad, great or small, of 
the policy and the practice of any Chinese political party upon the 
people depends on whether and how much it helps to develop their 
productive forces, and on whether it fetters or liberates these forces. 
The social productive forces of China can be liberated only by 
destroying the Japanese aggressors, carrying out land reform, emancipating 
the peasants, developing modern industry and establishing 
an independent, free, democratic, united, prosperous and powerful 
new China  and this will win the approbation of the Chinese 
people. 
It should be pointed out further that it is not easy for city 
intellectuals who come to work in the countryside to understand the 
characteristics of the rural areas, i.e., that they are still based on a 
scattered and backward, individual economy, and that, moreover, the 
Liberated Areas are temporarily cut off from one another by the enemy 
and involved in a guerrilla war. Failing to understand these characteristics, 
they often inappropriately approach and handle rural problems 
and rural work from the viewpoint of life and work in the cities, and 
so divorce themselves from the realities of the countryside and fail 
to identify themselves with the peasants. It is necessary to overcome 
this by education.

302 MAO TSE-TUNG 
China¹s numerous revolutionary intellectuals must awaken to the 
necessity of becoming one with the peasants. The peasants need them 
and await their help. They should go to the countryside enthusiastically, 
doff their student garb and put on rough clothing, and willingly 
start with any work however trivial; they should learn what the 
peasants want and help to arouse and organize them in the struggle to 
accomplish the democratic revolution in the countryside, which is one 
of the most important tasks in China¹s democratic revolution. 
After the Japanese aggressors are wiped out, we should confiscate 
the land usurped by them and the chief traitors and distribute it 
among those peasants who have little or no land. 
7. The Problem of Industry 
In order to defeat the Japanese aggressors and build a new China 
it is necessary to develop industry. But under the Kuomintang government 
there is dependence on foreign countries for everything, and its 
financial and economic policy is ruining the entire economic life of the 
people. A few small industrial enterprises are all that is to be found 
in the Kuomintang areas, and in most cases they have been unable 
to avoid bankruptcy. In the absence of political reforms all the productive 
forces are being ruined, and this is true both of agriculture and 
of industry. 
By and large, it will be impossible to develop industry unless 
China is independent, free, democratic and united. To wipe out the 
Japanese aggressors is to seek independence. To abolish the Kuomintang¹s 
one-party dictatorship, establish a democratic and united coalition 
government, transform all China¹s troops into a people¹s armed 
force, carry out land reform and emancipate the peasants is to seek 
freedom, democracy and unity. Without independence, freedom, 
democracy and unity it is impossible to build industry on a really large 
scale. Without industry there can be no solid national defence, no 
well-being for the people, no prosperity or strength for the nation. 
The history of the 105 years since the Opium War of 1840,11 and 
especially of the eighteen years since the Kuomintang came to power, 
has brought this important point home to the Chinese people. A China 
that is not poor and weak but prosperous and strong implies a China 
that is not colonial or semi-colonial but independent, not semi-feudal 
but free and democratic, not divided but united. In semi-colonial, 
semi-feudal and divided China, many people have for years dreamed 
of developing industry, building up national defence, and bringing

303 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
well-being to the people and prosperity and power to the nation, but 
all their dreams have been shattered. Many well-intentioned educators, 
scientists and students have buried themselves in their own work 
or studies and paid no attention to politics in the belief that they 
could serve the country with their knowledge, but this too has turned 
out to be a dream, a dream that has been shattered. This indeed is a 
good sign, for the shattering of these childish dreams marks a startingpoint 
on China¹s road towards prosperity and strength. The Chinese 
people have learned many things in the war; they know that after the 
defeat of the Japanese aggressors they must build a new-democratic 
China enjoying independence, freedom, democracy, unity, prosperity 
and strength, all of which are interrelated and indispensable. If they 
do so, then a bright future lies before China. The productive forces of 
the Chinese people will be released and given every possibility to 
develop only when the political system of New Democracy obtains in 
all parts of China. More and more people are coming to understand 
this point every day. 
When the political system of New Democracy is won, the Chinese 
people and their government will have to adopt practical measures in 
order to build heavy and light industry step by step over a number 
of years and transform China from an agricultural into an industrial 
country. The new-democratic state cannot be consolidated unless it 
has a solid economy as its base, a much more advanced agriculture 
than at present, and a large-scale industry occupying a predominant 
position in the national economy, with communications, trade and 
finance to match. 
We Communists are ready to fight for this objective in co-operation 
with all the democratic parties and industrial circles throughout the 
country. The Chinese working class will play a great role in this 
undertaking. 
Ever since World War I, the Chinese working class has consciously 
fought for the independence and liberation of China. The year 
witnessed the birth of the Communist Party of China, the vanguard 
of the working class, and China¹s struggle for liberation then entered 
a new stage. During the ensuing three periods, the Northern Expedition, 
the Agrarian Revolutionary War and the War of Resistance 
Against Japan, the working class and Communist Party of China 
have worked extremely hard and made an invaluable contribution 
to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. In the struggle 
for the final defeat of the Japanese aggressors, and especially for the

304 MAO TSE-TUNG 
recovery of the big cities and important lines of communications, the 
Chinese working class will play a very great role. And it can be 
predicted that after the anti-Japanese war, the effort and contribution 
of the Chinese working class will be even greater. The task of the 
Chinese working class is to struggle not only for the establishment of 
a new-democratic state but also for China¹s industrialization and the 
modernization of her agriculture. 
The policy of adjusting the interests of labour and capital will be 
adopted under the new-democratic state system. On the one hand, 
it will protect the interests of the workers, institute an eight- to tenhour 
working day according to circumstances, provide suitable unemployment 
relief and social insurance and safeguard trade union rights; 
on the other hand, it will guarantee legitimate profits to properly 
managed state, private and co-operative enterprises  so that both 
the public and the private sectors and both labour and capital will 
work together to develop industrial production. 
The enterprises and property in China of the Japanese aggressors 
and of the chief traitors will be confiscated and placed at the disposal 
of the government when Japan is defeated. 
8. The Problem of Culture, Education and the Intellectuals 
The calamities brought upon the Chinese people by foreign and 
feudal oppression also affect our national culture. The progressive 
cultural and educational institutions and progressive cultural workers 
and educators have particularly suffered. To sweep away foreign and 
feudal oppression and build a new-democratic China, we need large 
numbers of educators and teachers for the people, and also people¹s 
scientists, engineers, technicians, doctors, journalists, writers, men of 
letters, artists and rank-and-file cultural workers. They must be imbued 
with the spirit of serving the people and must work hard. Provided 
they serve the people creditably, all intellectuals should be esteemed 
and regarded as valuable national and social assets. The problem of 
the intellectuals becomes particularly important in China because the 
country is culturally backward as a result of foreign and feudal oppression 
and because intellectuals are urgently needed in the people¹s 
struggle for liberation. The numerous revolutionary intellectuals have 
played a very great role in the people¹s struggle for liberation in the 
past half-century, and especially since the May 4th Movement of 1919 
and in the eight years of the anti-Japanese war. They will play an 
even greater role in the struggles to come. Therefore, the task of a

305 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
people¹s government is systematically to develop all kinds of intellectually 
equipped cadres from among the ranks of the people and at 
the same time take care to unite with and re-educate all the useful 
intellectuals already available. 
The elimination of illiteracy among 80 per cent of the population 
is a vital task for the new China. 
Proper and firm steps should be taken to eliminate all enslaving 
feudal and fascist culture and education. 
Vigorous action should be taken to prevent and cure endemic and 
other diseases among the people and to expand the people¹s medical 
and health services. 
The old type of cultural and educational workers and doctors 
should be given suitable re-education so that they can acquire a new 
outlook and new methods to serve the people. 
The Chinese people¹s culture and education should be newdemocratic, 
that is to say, China should establish her own new national, 
scientific and mass culture and education. 
As for foreign culture, it would be a wrong policy to shut it out, 
rather we should as far as possible draw on what is progressive in it 
for use in the development of China¹s new culture; it would also be 
wrong to copy it blindly, rather we should draw on it critically to meet 
the actual needs of the Chinese people. The new culture created in 
the Soviet Union should be a model for us in building our people¹s 
culture. Similarly, ancient Chinese culture should neither be totally 
rejected nor blindly copied, but should be accepted discriminatingly 
so as to help the progress of China¹s new culture. 
9. The Problem of the Minority Nationalities 
The anti-popular clique of the Kuomintang denies that many nationalities 
exist in China, and labels all excepting the Han nationality 
as ³tribes². It has taken over the reactionary policy of the governments 
of the Ching Dynasty and of the Northern warlords in relation to the 
minority nationalities, oppressing and exploiting them in every possible 
way. Clear cases in point are the massacre of Mongolians of the 
Ikhchao League in 1943, the armed suppression of the minority nationalities 
in Sinkiang since 1944 and the massacres of the Hui people 
in Kansu Province in recent years. These are manifestations of a 
wrong Han-chauvinistic ideology and policy. 
In 1924 Dr. Sun Yat-sen wrote in the Manifesto of the First National 
Congress of the Kuomintang that ³the Kuomintang¹s Principle of

MAO TSE-TUNG 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
256 
Nationalism has a twofold meaning, first, the liberation of the Chinese 
nation, and second, the equality of all the nationalities in China² and 
that ³the Kuomintang solemnly declares that it recognizes the right to 
self-determination of all the nationalities in China and that a free and 
united republic of China (a free union of all the nationalities) will be 
established when the anti-imperialist and anti-warlord revolution is 
victorious². 
The Communist Party of China is in full agreement with Dr. Sun¹s 
policy on nationalities as stated here. Communists must actively help 
the people of all the minority nationalities to fight for it, and help 
them, including all their leaders who have ties with the masses, to 
fight for their political, economic and cultural emancipation and 
development and to establish their own armies which will safeguard 
the people¹s interests. Their spoken and written languages, their 
manners and customs and their religious beliefs must be respected. 
The attitude which the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and 
the Liberated Areas in northern China have for years adopted towards 
the Mongolian and Hui nationalities is correct, and the work they 
have done has been fruitful. 
10. The Problem of Foreign Policy 
The Communist Party of China agrees with the Atlantic Charter 
and with the decisions of the international conferences of Moscow, 
Cairo, Teheran and the Crimea,12 because these decisions all contribute 
to the defeat of the fascist aggressors and the maintenance of 
world peace. 
The fundamental principle of the foreign policy advocated by the 
Chinese Communist Party is as follows: China shall establish and 
strengthen diplomatic relations with all countries and settle all questions 
of common concern, such as co-ordination of military operations 
in the war, peace conferences, trade and investment, on the basic conditions 
that the Japanese aggressors must be completely defeated and 
world peace maintained, that there must be mutual respect for national 
independence and equality, and that there must be promotion of mutual 
interests and friendship between states and between peoples. 
The Chinese Communist Party fully agrees with the proposals of 
the Dumbarton Oaks conference and the decisions of the Crimea 
conference on the establishment of an organization to safeguard international 
peace and security after the war. It welcomes the United 
Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco.

307 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
It has appointed its own representative on China¹s delegation to this 
conference in order to express the will of the Chinese people.13 
We hold that the Kuomintang government must cease its hostility 
towards the Soviet Union and speedily improve Sino-Soviet relations. 
The Soviet Union was the first country to renounce the unequal treaties 
and sign new, equal treaties with China. At the time of the Kuomintang¹s 
First National Congress called by Dr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924 and 
the subsequent Northern Expedition, the Soviet Union was the only 
country to help China¹s war of liberation. When the anti-Japanese war 
broke out in 1937, the Soviet Union was again the first country to help 
China against the Japanese aggressors. The Chinese people are grateful 
to the Soviet government and people for this help. We believe that no 
final and thorough settlement of the problems of the Pacific is possible 
without the participation of the Soviet Union. 
We ask the governments of all the allied countries, and of the 
United States and Britain in the first place, to pay serious attention 
to the voice of the Chinese people and not to impair friendship 
with them by pursuing foreign policies that run counter to their will. 
We maintain that if any foreign government helps the Chinese reactionaries 
and opposes the Chinese people¹s democratic cause, it will 
be committing a gross mistake. 
The Chinese people welcome the steps taken by many foreign 
governments in renouncing their unequal treaties and concluding new, 
equal treaties with China. However, we maintain that the conclusion 
of equal treaties does not in itself mean that China has actually won 
genuine equality. Genuine and actual equality is never the gift of 
foreign governments, but must be won mainly by the Chinese people 
through their own efforts, and the way to win it is to build a newdemocratic 
China politically, economically and culturally; otherwise 
there will be only nominal and not actual independence and equality. 
That is to say, China can never win genuine independence and equality 
by following the present policy of the Kuomintang government. 
We consider that, after the defeat and unconditional surrender of 
the Japanese aggressors, it will be necessary to help all the democratic 
forces of the Japanese people to establish their own democratic system 
so that Japanese fascism and militarism may be thoroughly wiped out, 
together with their political, economic and social roots. Unless the 
Japanese people have a democratic system, it will be impossible 
thoroughly to wipe out Japanese fascism and militarism and impossible 
to ensure peace in the Pacific.

308 MAO TSE-TUNG 
We consider the decision of the Cairo conference regarding the 
independence of Korea to be correct. The Chinese people should help 
the Korean people to win liberation. 
We hope that India will attain independence. For an independent 
and democratic India is not only needed by the Indian people but is 
essential for world peace. 
As regards the Southeast Asian countries  Burma, Malaya, Indonesia, 
Viet Nam and the Philippines  we hope that after the defeat 
of the Japanese aggressors their people will exercise their right to 
establish independent and democratic states of their own. As for 
Thailand, she should be treated like the fascist satellite states in 
Europe. 
* * * 
So much for the major points of our specific programme. 
To repeat, none of the points in this specific programme can be 
successfully carried out on a nation-wide scale without a democratic 
coalition government enjoying the support of the entire nation. 
By its twenty-four years of struggle for the cause of the liberation 
of the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China has attained 
a position such that any political party or social group or any Chinese 
or foreigner ignoring its opinion on questions concerning China will 
be making a serious mistake and courting certain failure. There were, 
and still are, people who try to ignore our opinions and to follow their 
own bigoted course, but they have all ended in a blind alley. Why? 
Simply because our opinions conform to the interests of the Chinese 
masses. The Chinese Communist Party is the most faithful spokesman 
of the Chinese people, and whoever fails to respect it in fact fails to 
respect the Chinese masses and is doomed to defeat. 
THE TASKS IN THE KUOMINTANG AREAS 
I have now given a detailed explanation of our Party¹s general 
and specific programmes. There is no doubt that these programmes 
will eventually be put into effect throughout China; this is the vista 
that the international and domestic situation as a whole has opened 
up for the Chinese people. However, at the moment conditions in the 
Kuomintang areas, the enemy-occupied areas and the Liberated Areas 
differ from each other, making it necessary for us to distinguish between 
them in implementing our programme. Different conditions give rise

309 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
to different tasks. Some of these tasks I have already explained above, 
while others still need elaboration. 
In the Kuomintang areas, the people are not free to engage in 
patriotic activity, and democratic movements are considered illegal, 
and yet various social strata, democratic parties and individuals are 
becoming increasingly active. The China Democratic League issued 
a manifesto in January this year demanding the termination of the 
Kuomintang¹s one-party dictatorship and the establishment of a 
coalition government. Many sections of the people have made similar 
declarations. Within the Kuomintang, too, many people are showing 
increasing doubt and discontent over the policies of the leading bodies 
of their own party, are becoming increasingly aware of the danger 
of their party¹s isolation from the people, and are therefore demanding 
democratic reforms suited to the times. In Chungking and other places 
democratic movements are growing among the workers, the peasants, 
cultural circles, the students, educational circles, women, industrial 
and commercial circles, government employees and even among some 
of the soldiers and officers. These facts indicate that the democratic 
movements of all the oppressed strata are gradually converging on a 
common objective. One weakness of the present movements is that 
the basic sections of society have not yet joined it on a wide scale and 
that the most important forces, namely, the peasants, workers, soldiers 
and the lower-ranking government employees and teachers, who are 
all suffering so bitterly, are not yet organized. Another weakness is 
that many of the democratic personalities in the movement are still 
unclear and hesitant about the fundamental policy, namely, that a 
change in the situation must be sought through the waging of struggle 
on a democratic mass basis. However, the objective situation is compelling 
all the oppressed strata, political parties and social groups 
gradually to awaken and unite. No suppression by the Kuomintang 
government can stop the advance of this movement. 
All the oppressed strata, political parties and social groups in the 
Kuomintang areas must extend their democratic movement on a broad 
scale and gradually weld their scattered forces together in order to 
fight for national unity, the establishment of a coalition government, 
the defeat of the Japanese aggressors and the building of a new China. 
The Communist Party of China and the people of the Liberated Areas 
should give them every possible help. 
In the Kuomintang areas the Communists should continue to pursue 
the policy of a broad National United Front Against Japan. In the fight

310
for common objectives, we should co-operate with anyone who does 
not oppose us today, even though he might have done so yesterday. 
THE TASKS IN THE JAPANESE-OCCUPIED AREAS 
In the occupied areas, Communists should call on all who oppose 
Japan to follow the French and Italian examples and form organizations 
and underground forces to prepare armed uprisings, so that 
when the time comes they can act from the inside in co-ordination 
with the armies attacking from the outside and so wipe out the Japanese 
aggressors. The atrocities, plunder, rape and humiliation suffered by 
our brothers and sisters in the occupied areas at the hands of the 
Japanese aggressors and their servile lackeys have aroused the burning 
wrath of all Chinese, and the hour of revenge is fast approaching. 
The victories in the European theatre of war and the victories of our 
Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies have stimulated and heightened 
the anti-Japanese spirit of the people in the occupied areas. They 
urgently want to become organized so as to achieve liberation as 
quickly as possible. Therefore, we must raise our work in the occupied 
areas to the same level of importance as that in the Liberated Areas. 
Large numbers of our working personnel must be sent to work there 
Large numbers of activists among the people there must be trained 
and promoted and must take part in local work. We must intensify our 
underground work in the four northeastern provinces which have been 
occupied longer than any other region and which form a key industrial 
and troop concentration area for the Japanese aggressors. With a view 
to the recovery of these lost territories, we should strengthen our 
solidarity with the people who have fled south from the Northeast. 
Communists should pursue the broadest united front policy in 
all the occupied areas. For the overthrow of the common enemy they 
must unite with anyone who is opposed to the Japanese aggressors 
and their servile lackeys. 
We should warn all the puppet armies, the puppet police and others 
who are helping the enemy and opposing their countrymen that they 
must quickly recognize the criminal nature of their actions, repent in 
time and atone for their crimes by helping their countrymen against 
the enemy. Otherwise the nation will certainly call them to account 
the day the enemy collapses. 
Communists should direct persuasive propaganda at all puppet 
organizations with a mass following so as to win the masses who have

311 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
been misled over to our side against the national enemy. At the same 
time, evidence should be collected about those impenitent collaborators 
who have committed the most heinous crimes, so that they can be 
brought to justice when the lost territories are recovered. 
Those Kuomintang reactionaries who have betrayed the nation 
by organizing open collaborators to fight the Chinese people, the 
Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army 
and other armed forces of the people must be warned to repent in 
time. Otherwise, when the lost territories are recovered, they will 
certainly be punished for their crimes along with the collaborators 
with Japan and will be shown no mercy. 
THE TASKS IN THE LIBERATED AREAS 
Our Party has put its whole new-democratic programme into 
practice in the Liberated Areas with striking results, and so built up 
tremendous anti-Japanese strength, and from now on this strength 
should be developed and consolidated in every way. 
In the prevailing circumstances, the troops of the Liberated Areas 
should launch extensive attacks on all places that can be captured from 
the Japanese and puppets in order to expand the Liberated Areas 
and reduce the occupied areas. 
But at the same time it should be borne in mind that the enemy 
is still strong and may launch further attacks on the Liberated Areas. 
The army and the people of our areas must be ready at all times 
to smash his attacks and must work in every way to consolidate 
these areas. 
We must expand the armies, the guerrilla units, the people¹s militia 
and the self-defence corps of the Liberated Areas, and increase their 
combat effectiveness by speeding up their training and consolidation 
in order to build up adequate strength for the final defeat of the 
aggressors. 
The army in the Liberated Areas must support the government 
and cherish the people, while the democratic governments must lead 
the people in the work of supporting the army and taking good care 
of the families of soldiers fighting Japan. In this way relations between 
the army and the people will become still better. 
In the work of the local coalition governments and mass organizations, 
Communists should continue to co-operate closely with all anti- 
Japanese democrats on the basis of the new-democratic programme.

312 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Similarly in military work, Communists should co-operate closely 
with all anti-Japanese democrats who are willing to co-operate 
with us, whether or not they are members of the armies of the 
Liberated Areas. 
To increase the enthusiasm of the masses of the workers, peasants 
and other working people for the war and for production, we must 
thoroughly apply the policy of reducing rent and interest and of increasing 
the pay of workers and office staff. The cadres of the Liberated 
Areas must diligently learn to do economic work. All available forces 
must be mobilized for the extensive development of agriculture, industry 
and trade and the improvement of the livelihood of the soldiers 
and the people. For this purpose there must be labour emulation campaigns, 
and rewards should be given to labour heroes and model workers. 
When the Japanese aggressors are driven out of the cities, our 
personnel must rapidly learn how to do urban economic work. 
Our cultural and educational work must be developed in order 
to raise the level of political consciousness of the people in the Liberated 
Areas and, above all, of the masses of the workers, peasants and soldiers, 
and in order to train large numbers of cadres. In carrying forward 
this work, those engaged in it should adopt forms and select contents 
suited to the existing rural conditions and to the needs and wishes of 
the people in the countryside. 
In all our work in the Liberated Areas, manpower and material 
resources must be used most sparingly, and in every held long-term 
plans must be made, and misuse and waste must be avoided. This is 
needed both for defeating the Japanese aggressors and for building 
up the new China. 
In all our work in the Liberated Areas, we must take great care 
to help the local people administer local affairs and to cultivate many 
local cadres from among the best local people. It will be impossible 
to accomplish the great task of the democratic revolution in the rural 
areas unless comrades who come from other places identify themselves 
with the local people and help the local cadres whole-heartedly, painstakingly 
and in ways that fit the actual conditions, and unless they 
cherish them like their own brothers and sisters. 
When a unit of the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army or 
any other armed force of the people arrives at a place, it should immediately 
help the local people to organize forces led by the local cadres, 
including not only militia and self-defence corps but also local troops 
and regional forces. This will make possible the eventual creation

313 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
of regular forces and regular army formations led by local people. 
This is an extremely important task. Unless it is accomplished, we 
can neither build stable anti-Japanese base areas nor expand the 
people¹s army. 
Of course the local people for their part should warmly welcome 
and help the revolutionary workers and people¹s forces coming from 
other areas. 
Everybody should be alerted on the question of dealing with 
covert wreckers. For it is easy to spot and handle overt enemies 
and wreckers of the national cause, but not those who work under 
cover. Therefore we should take up this matter in all seriousness and 
at the same time be very careful in dealing with such people. 
All religions are permitted in China¹s Liberated Areas, in accordance 
with the principle of freedom of religious belief. All believers 
in Protestantism, Catholicism, Islamism, Buddhism and other faiths 
enjoy the protection of the people¹s government so long as they are 
abiding by its laws. Everyone is free to believe or not to believe; neither 
compulsion nor discrimination is permitted. 
Our congress should propose to the people of the Liberated Areas 
that a people¹s conference of the Chinese Liberated Areas14 be held 
in Yenan as soon as possible to discuss the questions of co-ordinating 
the activities of the various Liberated Areas, strengthening their work 
in the War of Resistance, helping the people¹s anti-Japanese democratic 
movement in the Kuomintang areas, helping the underground armed 
forces of the people in the occupied areas, and promoting national 
unity and the formation of a coalition government. Now that China¹s 
Liberated Areas have become the centre of gravity in the nationwide 
people¹s struggle to resist Japan and save the country, the broad 
masses throughout the country pin their hopes on us and it is our 
duty not to disappoint them. Such a conference would give great 
impetus to the Chinese people¹s cause of national liberation. 
V. LET THE WHOLE PARTY UNITE AND 
FIGHT TO ACCOMPLISH ITS TASKS! 
Comrades! Now that we understand our tasks and the policies for 
accomplishing them, what should be our attitude in carrying out these 
policies and performing these tasks?

314 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The present international and domestic situation opens up bright 
prospects and provides unprecedentedly favourable conditions for us 
and the Chinese people as a whole; this is evident and beyond doubt. 
But at the same time there are still serious difficulties. Anyone who 
sees only the bright side but not the difficulties cannot fight effectively 
for the accomplishment of the Party¹s tasks. 
Together with the Chinese people, our Party has built up immense 
strength for the Chinese nation in the twenty-four years of the Party¹s 
history, including the eight years of the War of Resistance Against 
Japan, the success of our work is obvious and beyond doubt. But at 
the same time there are still defects in our work. Anyone who sees 
only the successful side but not the defects likewise cannot fight 
effectively for the accomplishment of the Party¹s tasks. 
In the twenty-four years since its birth in 1921, the Communist 
Party of China has gone through three great struggles  the Northern 
Expedition, the Agrarian Revolutionary War and the War of Resistance 
Against Japan which is still going on. From its very beginning our 
Party has based itself on the theory of Marxism-Leninism, for Marxism- 
Leninism is the crystallization of the most correct and most revolutionary 
scientific thought of the world proletariat. When the universal 
truth of Marxism-Leninism began to be integrated with the concrete 
practice of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese revolution took on an 
entirely new complexion and the entire historical stage of New Democracy 
emerged. Armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, the Communist 
Party of China has brought a new style of work to the Chinese people, 
a style of work which essentially entails integrating theory with practice, 
forging close links with the masses and practising self-criticism. 
The universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which reflects the 
practice of proletarian struggle throughout the world, becomes an 
invincible weapon for the Chinese people when it is integrated with 
the concrete practice of the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese proletariat 
and people. This the Communist Party of China has achieved. 
Our Party has grown and advanced through staunch struggle against 
every manifestation of dogmatism and empiricism, which runs counter 
to this principle. Dogmatism is divorced from concrete practice, while 
empiricism mistakes fragmentary experience for universal truth; both 
kinds of opportunist thinking run counter to Marxism. In the course 
of its twenty-four years of struggle our Party has successfully fought 
such wrong thinking and it is still doing so, thus greatly consolidating 
itself ideologically. Our Party now has 1,210,000 members. The over

315 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
whelming majority have joined during the War of Resistance, and 
there are various impurities in their ideology. The same is true of 
some of the members who joined the Party before the war. The work 
of rectification in the last few years has been most successful and has 
gone a long way towards removing these impurities. This work should 
be continued and ideological education within the Party should be 
developed still more extensively in the spirit of ³learning from past 
mistakes to avoid future ones² and ³curing the sickness to save the 
patient². We must enable the Party¹s leading cadres at all levels to 
understand that close integration of theory and practice is a hallmark 
distinguishing our Party from all other political parties. Therefore 
ideological education is the key link to be grasped in uniting the whole 
Party for great political struggles. Unless this is done, the Party cannot 
accomplish any of its political tasks. 
Another hallmark distinguishing our Party from all other political 
parties is that we have very close ties with the broadest masses of the 
people. Our point of departure is to serve the people whole-heartedly 
and never for a moment divorce ourselves from the masses, to proceed 
in all cases from the interests of the people and not from the interests 
of individuals or groups, and to understand the identity of our responsibility 
to the people and our responsibility to the leading organs 
of the Party. Communists must be ready at all times to stand up for 
the truth, because truth is in the interests of the people; Communists 
must be ready at all times to correct their mistakes, because mistakes 
are against the interests of the people. Twenty-four years of experience 
tell us that the right task, policy and style of work invariably conformwith 
the demands of the masses at a given time and place and invariably 
strengthen our ties with the masses, and the wrong task, policy and 
style of work invariably disagree with the demands of the masses at 
a given time and place and invariably alienate us from the masses. 
The reason why such evils as dogmatism, empiricism, commandism, 
tailism, sectarianism, bureaucracy and an arrogant attitude in work 
are definitely harmful and intolerable, and why anyone suffering from 
these maladies must overcome them, is that they alienate us from the 
masses. Our congress should call upon the whole Party to be vigilant 
and to see that no comrade at any post is divorced from the masses. 
It should teach every comrade to love the people and listen attentively 
to the voice of the masses; to identify himself with the masses wherever 
he goes and, instead of standing above them, to immerse himself among 
them; and, according to their present level, to awaken them or raise their

316 MAO TSE-TUNG 
political consciousness and help them gradually to organize themselves 
voluntarily and to set going all essential struggles permitted by the 
internal and external circumstances of the given time and place. Commandism 
is wrong in any type of work, because in overstepping the 
level of political consciousness of the masses and violating the principle 
of voluntary mass action it reflects the disease of impetuosity. Our 
comrades must not assume that everything they themselves understand 
is understood by the masses. Whether the masses understand it and 
are ready to take action can be discovered only by going into their 
midst and making investigations. If we do so, we can avoid commandism. 
Tailism in any type of work is also wrong, because in falling 
below the level of political consciousness of the masses and violating 
the principle of leading the masses forward it reflects the disease of 
dilatoriness. Our comrades must not assume that the masses have 
no understanding of what they themselves do not yet understand. 
It often happens that the masses outstrip us and are eager to advance 
a step when our comrades are still tailing behind certain backward 
elements, for instead of acting as leaders of the masses such comrades 
reflect the views of these backward elements and, moreover, mistake 
them for those of the broad masses. In a word, every comrade must 
be brought to understand that the supreme test of the words and deeds 
of a Communist is whether they conform with the highest interests and 
enjoy the support of the overwhelming majority of the people. Every 
comrade must be helped to understand that as long as we rely on the 
people, believe firmly in the inexhaustible creative power of the masses 
and hence trust and identify ourselves with them, no enemy can crush 
us while we can crush every enemy and overcome every difficulty. 
Conscientious practice of self-criticism is still another hallmark 
distinguishing our Party from all other political parties. As we say, 
dust will accumulate if a room is not cleaned regularly, our faces will 
get dirty if they are not washed regularly. Our comrades¹ minds and 
our Party¹s work may also collect dust, and also need sweeping and 
washing. The proverb ³Running water is never stale and a door-hinge 
is never worm-eaten² means that constant motion prevents the inroads 
of germs and other organisms. To check up regularly on our work 
and in the process develop a democratic style of work, to fear neither 
criticism nor self-criticism, and to apply such good popular Chinese 
maxims as ³Say all you know and say it without reserve², ³Blame not 
the speaker but be warned by his words² and ³Correct mistakes if 
you have committed them and guard against them if you have not² 

317 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
this is the only effective way to prevent all kinds of political dust and 
germs from contaminating the minds of our comrades and the body 
of our Party. The reason for the great effectiveness of the rectification 
movement, the purpose of which was ³to learn from past mistakes to 
avoid future ones and to cure the sickness to save the patient², was 
that the criticism and self-criticism we carried out were honest and 
conscientious, and not perfunctory and distorted. As we Chinese Communists, 
who base all our actions on the highest interests of the broadest 
masses of the Chinese people and who are fully convinced of the justice 
of our cause, never balk at any personal sacrifice and are ready at all 
times to give our lives for the cause, can we be reluctant to discard 
any idea, viewpoint, opinion or method which is not suited to the 
needs of the people? Can we be willing to allow political dust and 
germs to dirty our clean faces or eat into our healthy organism? 
Countless revolutionary martyrs have laid down their lives in the 
interests of the people, and our hearts are filled with pain as we the 
living think of them  can there be any personal interest, then, that 
we would not sacrifice or any error that we would not discard? 
Comrades! When this congress is over, we shall go to the front 
and, guided by its resolutions, fight to bring about the final defeat 
of the Japanese aggressors and to build a new China. To achieve this 
aim, we shall unite with all the people of our country. Let me repeat: 
We shall unite with any class, any party, any group or individual if 
they are for the defeat of the Japanese aggressors and the building of 
a new China. To achieve this aim, we shall solidly unite all the forces 
of our Party on democratic centralist principles of organization and 
discipline. We shall unite with any comrade if he abides by the Party¹s 
Programme, Constitution and decisions. In the period of the Northern 
Expedition our Party had a membership of less than 60,000, most of 
whom were later dispersed by the enemy; in the period of the Agrarian 
Revolutionary War we had a membership of less than 300,000, most 
of whom were likewise dispersed by the enemy. Now we have more 
than 1,200,000 members, this time we must in no circumstances allow 
ourselves to be dispersed by the enemy. If we can profit from the 
experience of these three periods, if we are modest and guard against 
conceit and are able to strengthen unity among all comrades inside 
the Party and with all the people outside the Party, we can rest assured 
that, far from being dispersed by the enemy, we shall destroy the Japanese 
aggressors and their servile running dogs resolutely, thoroughly, 
wholly and completely, and thereafter build a new-democratic China.

318 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The experience of the three periods of the revolution, and especially 
that of the War of Resistance Against Japan, has convinced us and 
the whole Chinese people that without the efforts of the Chinese Communist 
Party, without the Chinese Communists as the mainstay of the 
Chinese people, China can never achieve independence or liberation, 
or industrialization and the modernization of her agriculture. 
Comrades! I firmly believe that with the Communist Party of 
China armed with the experience of the three revolutions, we can 
accomplish our great political task. 
Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have heroically laid down 
their lives for the people; let us hold their banner high and march 
ahead along the path crimson with their blood! 
A new-democratic China will soon be born. Let us hail that 
great day! 
NOTES 
1 The Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Corps, or to give its shorter name 
the National Vanguard Corps, was a revolutionary youth organization formed 
under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in September 1936 by the 
progressive youth who participated in the December 9th Movement of 1935. After 
the outbreak of the War of Resistance, many of its members saw action and took 
part in building base areas behind the enemy lines. The organizations of the National 
Vanguard Corps in the Kuomintang areas were forcibly dissolved by the Chiang 
Kai-shek government in 1938; those in the Liberated Areas were later merged into 
the Association of Youth for National Salvation, an organization of even broader 
scope.

2 On July 7, 1937, the Japanese invading forces attacked the Chinese garrison at 
Lukouchiao, some ten kilometres southwest of Peking. Under the influence of the 
ardent and nation-wide anti-Japanese movement the Chinese troops put up resistance. 
This incident marked the beginning of the Chinese people¹s heroic War of Resistance 
Against Japan which lasted for eight years.

4 These operations to force China¹s north-south trunk railways open for through 
traffic constituted the offensive launched in May 1944 by the Japanese army to seize 
the Canton-Hankow Railway along its entire length and thus secure an uninterrupted 
land link between northern and southern China.

5 Scobie was the commander of the British imperialist forces of aggression in 
Greece. In October 1944, when the German invaders were retreating in defeat on 
the European continent, Scobie¹s troops entered the country, bringing with them 
the reactionary Greek government that had been in exile in London. Scobie directed 
and assisted this government in attacking the Greek People¹s Liberation Army, which

319 ON COALITION GOVERNMENT 
had waged a long and heroic struggle against the German invaders, and in massacring 
Greek patriots, and so plunged Greece into a blood bath. 
6 Pao chia was the administrative system by which the Kuomintang reactionary 
clique enforced its fascist rule at the primary level. On August 1, 1932, Chiang Kai-shek 
promulgated his ³Regulations for the Organization of Pao and Chia and for a 
Population Census in the Counties², covering the provinces of Honan, Hupeh and 
Anhwei. The ³Regulations² provided that ³the pao and chia are to be organized 
on the basis of households, there is to be a head of each household, of each chia, 
which is made up of ten households, and of each pao, which is made up of ten chia². 
Neighbours were required to watch each other¹s activities and report them to the 
authorities, and all were punishable when one was found guilty; counter-revolutionary 
measures for exacting compulsory labour were also laid down. On November 7, 1934, 
the Kuomintang government officially announced that this system of fascist rule was 
to be established in all the provinces and municipalities under its rule. 
7 The Cairo conference, held by China, the United States and Britain in November 
1943, issued the Cairo Declaration which clearly stipulated that Taiwan and 
certain other territories were to be returned to China. In June 1950 the U.S. government 
sent a fleet to control Taiwan in open repudiation of this agreement, in the 
attempt to deprive China of her sovereignty over it. 
8 Yuan Shih-kai was the head of the Northern warlords in the last years of the 
Ching Dynasty. After the Ching Dynasty was overthrown by the Revolution of 1911, 
he usurped the presidency of the Republic and organized the first government of the 
Northern warlords, which represented the big landlord and big comprador classes. 
He did this by relying on counter-revolutionary armed force and on the support of 
the imperialists and by taking advantage of the conciliationist character of the bourgeoisie, 
which was then leading the revolution. In 1915 he wanted to make himself 
emperor and, to gain the support of the Japanese imperialists, accepted the Twenty-one 
Demands with which Japan aimed at obtaining exclusive control of all China. In 
December of the same year an uprising against his assumption of the throne took 
place in Yunnan Province and promptly won nation-wide response and support. 
Yuan Shih-kai died in Peking in June 1916.

11 For many decades, beginning with the end of the 18th century, Britain exported 
an increasing quantity of opium to China. This traffic not only subjected the Chinese 
people to drugging but also plundered China of her silver. It aroused fierce opposition 
in China. In 1840, under the pretext of safeguarding its trade with China, Britain 
launched armed aggression against her. The Chinese troops led by Lin Tse-hsu put 
up resistance, and the people in Canton spontaneously organized the ³Quell-the- 
British Corps², which dealt serious blows to the British forces of aggression. In 1842, 
however, the corrupt Ching regime signed the Treaty of Nanking with Britain. This 
treaty provided for the payment of indemnities and the cession of Hongkong to 
Britain, and stipulated that Shanghai, Foochow, Amoy, Ningpo and Canton were 
to be opened to British trade and that tariff rates for British goods imported into 
China were to be jointly fixed by China and Britain. 
12 The Atlantic Charter was issued jointly by the United States and Britain 
at the conclusion of their Atlantic conference in August 1941. The Moscow con

320 MAO TSE-TUNG 
ference was held in October 1943 by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, 
the United States and Britain. The Teheran conference of the Soviet Union, the 
United States and Britain was held in the capital of Iran from November to December 
1943. The Crimea conference of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain took 
place in February 1945 at Yalta. At all these international conferences the signatories 
recorded their resolve to defeat fascist Germany and Japan through common endeavour 
and, after the war, to prevent the revival of the forces of aggression and the 
remnants of fascism, maintain world peace and help the peoples of all countries to 
realize their aspirations for independence and democracy. But immediately after 
the war the U.S. and British governments violated all these international agreements. 
13 As the representative of China¹s Liberated Areas Comrade Tung Pi-wu attended 
the United Nations Conference on International Organization which was held at 
San Francisco from April to June 1945, with the participation of representatives 
from fifty countries. The proposals for the Organization of the United Nations were 
drafted at Dumbarton Oaks, U.S.A., where the representatives of the Soviet Union, 
the United States, Britain and China met from August to October 1944 in accordance 
with the decisions of the Moscow and Teheran conferences. 
14 With Japan¹s surrender the situation changed and the people¹s conference of 
the Chinese Liberated Areas was not convened, although a Preparatory Committee 
for this conference was formed in Yenan after the Seventh National Congress of the 
Chinese Communist Party and held an inaugural meeting which was attended by 
representatives from all the Liberated Areas.

THE FOOLISH OLD MAN 
WHO REMOVED THE MOUNTAINS 
June 11, 1945
We have had a very successful congress. We have done three things. 
First, we have decided on the line of our Party, which is boldly to 
mobilize the masses and expand the people¹s forces so that, under the 
leadership of our Party, they will defeat the Japanese aggressors, 
liberate the whole people and build a new-democratic China. Second, 
we have adopted the new Party Constitution. Third, we have elected 
the leading body of the Party  the Central Committee. Henceforth 
our task is to lead the whole membership in carrying out the Party 
line. Ours has been a congress of victory, a congress of unity. The 
delegates have made excellent comments on the three reports. Many 
comrades have undertaken self-criticism; with unity as the objective 
unity has been achieved through self-criticism. This congress is a 
model of unity, of self-criticism and of inner-Party democracy. 
When the congress closes, many comrades will be leaving for their 
posts and the various war fronts. Comrades, wherever you go, you 
should propagate the line of the congress and, through the members 
of the Party, explain it to the broad masses. 
Our aim in propagating the line of the congress is to build up the 
confidence of the whole Party and the entire people in the certain 
triumph of the revolution. We must first raise the political consciousness 
of the vanguard so that, resolute and unafraid of sacrifice, they 
will surmount every difficulty to win victory. But this is not enough; 
we must also arouse the political consciousness of the entire people so 
that they may willingly and gladly fight together with us for victory. 
We should fire the whole people with the conviction that China belongs

Congress of the Communist Party of China.

not to the reactionaries but to the Chinese people. There is an ancient 
Chinese fable called ³The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains². 
It tells of an old man who lived in northern China long, long ago 
and was known as the Foolish Old Man of North Mountain. His house 
faced south and beyond his doorway stood the two great peaks, Taihang 
and Wangwu, obstructing the way. He called his sons, and hoe 
in hand they began to dig up these mountains with great determination. 
Another greybeard, known as the Wise Old Man, saw them and 
said derisively, ³How silly of you to do this! It is quite impossible 
for you few to dig up these two huge mountains.² The Foolish Old Man 
replied, ³When I die, my sons will carry on; when they die, there will 
be my grandsons, and then their sons and grandsons, and so on to 
infinity. High as they are, the mountains cannot grow any higher and 
with every bit we dig, they will be that much lower. Why can¹t we 
clear them away?² Having refuted the Wise Old Man¹s wrong view, 
he went on digging every day, unshaken in his conviction. God was 
moved by this, and he sent down two angels, who carried the mountains 
away on their backs. Today, two big mountains lie like a dead 
weight on the Chinese people. One is imperialism, the other is feudalism. 
The Chinese Communist Party has long made up its mind to dig 
them up. We must persevere and work unceasingly, and we, too, will 
touch God¹s heart. Our God is none other than the masses of the 
Chinese people. If they stand up and dig together with us, why can¹t 
these two mountains be cleared away? 
Yesterday, in a talk with two Americans who were leaving for the 
United States, I said that the U.S. government was trying to undermine 
us and this would not be permitted. We oppose the U.S. government¹s 
policy of supporting Chiang Kai-shek against the Communists. But we 
must draw a distinction, firstly, between the people of the United 
States and their government and, secondly, within the U.S. government 
between the policy-makers and their subordinates. I said to these two 
Americans, ³Tell the policy-makers in your government that we forbid 
you Americans to enter the Liberated Areas because your policy is 
to support Chiang Kai-shek against the Communists, and we have to 
be on our guard. You can come to the Liberated Areas if your purpose 
is to fight Japan, but there must first be an agreement. We will not 
permit you to nose around everywhere. Since Patrick J. Hurley1 has 
publicly declared against co-operation with the Chinese Communist 
Party, why do you still want to come and prowl around in our 
Liberated Areas?²

323 THE FOOLISH OLD MAN WHO REMOVED THE MOUNTAINS 
The U.S. government¹s policy of supporting Chiang Kai-shek 
against the Communists shows the brazenness of the U.S. reactionaries. 
But all the scheming of the reactionaries, whether Chinese or foreign, 
to prevent the Chinese people from achieving victory is doomed to 
failure. The democratic forces are the main current in the world today, 
while reaction is only a counter-current. The reactionary countercurrent 
is trying to swamp the main current of national independence 
and people¹s democracy, but it can never become the main current. 
Today, there are still three major contradictions in the old world, as 
Stalin pointed out long ago: first, the contradiction between the proletariat 
and the bourgeoisie in the imperialist countries; second, the 
contradiction between the various imperialist powers; and third, the 
contradiction between the colonial and semi-colonial countries and 
the imperialist metropolitan countries.2 Not only do these three contradictions 
continue to exist but they are becoming more acute and 
widespread. Because of their existence and growth, the time will 
come when the reactionary anti-Soviet, anti-Communist and antidemocratic 
counter-current still in existence today will be swept away. 
At this moment two congresses are being held in China, the Sixth 
National Congress of the Kuomintang and the Seventh National Congress 
of the Communist Party. They have completely different aims: 
the aim of one is to liquidate the Communist Party and all the other 
democratic forces in China and thus to plunge China into darkness; the 
aim of the other is to overthrow Japanese imperialism and its lackeys, 
the Chinese feudal forces, and build a new-democratic China and thus 
to lead China to light. These two lines are in conflict with each other. 
We firmly believe that, led by the Chinese Communist Party and guided 
by the line of its Seventh Congress, the Chinese people will achieve 
complete victory, while the Kuomintang¹s counter-revolutionary line 
will inevitably fail.

ON PRODUCTION BY THE ARMY 
FOR ITS OWN SUPPORT 
AND ON THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THE GREAT MOVEMENTS FOR RECTIFICATION 
AND FOR PRODUCTION 
April 27, 1945 
In the existing circumstances in which our army is facing extreme 
material difficulties and is engaged in dispersed operations, it is 
absolutely inadmissible for the leading bodies to assume full responsibility 
for provisioning the army, for to do so would both hamper 
the initiative of the large numbers of officers and men at the lower 
levels and fail to satisfy their needs. We should say, ³Comrades, let 
us all go into action and overcome our difficulties!² If only the leadership 
at the higher levels sets the tasks well and gives the lower levels 
a free hand to overcome difficulties by their own efforts, the problem 
will be solved and, indeed, solved in a more satisfactory way. But if, 
instead, the higher levels always shoulder loads heavier than they 
can really carry, dare not give the lower levels a free hand and do 
not arouse enthusiasm for self-reliance among the broad masses, then 
in spite of all the efforts of the higher levels the result will be that 
both the higher and the lower levels will find themselves in a 
predicament, and the problem will never be solved in the existing 
circumstances. The experience of the last few years has amply borne 
this out. The principle of ³unified leadership and decentralized 
management² has proved to be the correct one for organizing all 
economic activities in our Liberated Areas in the present circumstances. 
The armed forces of the Liberated Areas already total more than 
900,000 men. To defeat the Japanese aggressors, we must increase

Daily, Yenan. 
325

326 MAO TSE-TUNG 
them to several times this number. But we have so far received no 
outside aid. Even if we get it in the future, we shall still have to provide 
our own means of livelihood; on that score there must be no illusions 
whatsoever. In the near future we shall have to take the necessary 
number of military formations from the areas where they are now 
engaged in dispersed operations, and concentrate them for attack on 
particular enemy objectives. Such big formations for concentrated 
action will be unable to engage in production to support themselves, 
and, what is more, will need large supplies from the rear; only the 
local troops and regional formations remaining behind (and they will 
still be considerable) will be able both to fight and to engage in 
production as before. Such being the case, is there any doubt that, as 
long as fighting and training are not impeded, all troops without exception 
should use the present opportunity to learn how to be partially 
self-supporting through production? 
In our circumstances, production by the army for its own support, 
though backward or retrogressive in form, is progressive in substance 
and of great historic significance. Formally speaking, we are violating 
the principle of division of labour. However, in our circumstances  
the poverty and disunity of the country (resulting from the crimes 
of the chief ruling clique of the Kuomintang), and the protracted and 
dispersed people¹s guerrilla war  what we are doing is progressive. 
Look how pale and emaciated the Kuomintang soldiers are, and how 
robust and strong our soldiers of the Liberated Areas are! Look what 
difficulties we ourselves had before we started production for selfsupport, 
and how much better off we have been since! Let us ask two 
army units here, say two companies, to choose between the two 
methods, i.e., between the higher levels supplying them with all their 
means of livelihood and the higher levels supplying little or nothing 
but letting them produce for themselves all that they need, or the 
greater part, or half, or even less than half of what they need. Which 
method will yield better results? Which will they prefer? After a 
year¹s serious experiment in production for self-support, they will surely 
answer that the second method yields better results and be willing 
to adopt it, and they will surely answer that the first method yields 
poorer results and be unwilling to adopt it. The reason is that the 
second method can improve the living conditions of everyone in the 
army, whereas the first method can never satisfy their needs in the 
present difficult material circumstances, however hard the higher 
levels may try. Because we have adopted what seems to be a ³back

327 PRODUCTION BY THE ARMY AND RECTIFICATION 
ward² and ³retrogressive² method, our troops are able to overcome 
shortages in the means of livelihood and improve their living conditions, 
so that every soldier is robust and strong; as a result, we are 
able to ease the tax burden on the people who are also in difficulties, 
thus winning their support, and we are able to keep up the protracted 
war and expand our armed forces, thus extending the Liberated Areas, 
reducing the enemy-occupied areas and attaining our objective of 
final victory over the aggressor and the liberation of the whole of 
China. Is this not of great historic significance? 
Production by the army for its own support has not only improved 
the army¹s living conditions and lightened the burden on the people, 
thereby making it possible further to expand the army. In addition, 
it has had many immediate effects. They are as follows: 
(1) Improved relations between officers and men. Officers 
and men work together in production and become like brothers. 
(2) Better attitude to labour. What we now have is neither 
the old mercenary system nor universal military service, but a third 
system, the system of mobilizing volunteers. It is better than the 
mercenary system since it does not produce so many loafers, but 
it is not so good as universal military service. Nevertheless, our 
present conditions only allow us to adopt the system of mobilizing 
volunteers, and not that of universal military service. The mobilized 
soldiers have to lead an army life for a long time, which may impair 
their attitude to labour and so turn some of them into loafers or taint 
them with certain bad habits characteristic of the warlord armies. 
But since the army began to produce for its own support, the attitude 
to labour has improved and loafer ways have been overcome. 
(3) Strengthened discipline. Far from weakening discipline in 
battle and in army life, labour discipline in production actually 
strengthens it. 
(4) Improved relations between the army and the people. 
Once an armed force begins to ³keep house² for itself, encroachments 
upon the property of the people seldom or never occur. As 
the army and the people exchange labour and help each other in 
production, the friendship between them is strengthened. 
(5) Less grumbling in the army about the government and 
improved relations between the two. 
(6) An impetus to the great production campaign of the people. 
Once the army engages in production, the need for government

328 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and other organizations to do likewise becomes more obvious, 
and they do so more energetically; also, the need for a universal 
campaign of the whole people to increase production naturally 
becomes more obvious, and this too is carried on more energetically. 
The widespread movements for rectification and for production 
which began in 1942 and 1943 respectively have played and are still 
playing a decisive role, the one in our ideological and the other in our 
material life. Unless we grasp these two links at the right time, we 
shall be unable to grasp the whole chain of the revolution, and our 
struggle will not advance. 
As we know, of the members who joined the Party before 1937, 
only a few tens of thousands are left, and most of our present membership 
of 1,200,000 come from the peasantry and other sections of the 
petty bourgeoisie. The revolutionary fervour of these comrades is 
admirable and they wish to have Marxist training, but they have 
brought with them into the Party ideas which are out of keeping or 
not altogether in keeping with Marxism. The same is true of some 
people who joined the Party before 1937. It constitutes an extremely 
serious contradiction, an enormous difficulty. In these circumstances, 
could we have advanced smoothly if we had not started a widespread 
movement of Marxist education, that is, the rectification movement? 
Obviously not. But as we have solved or are in the process of solving 
this contradiction among large numbers of cadres  the contradiction, 
within the Party, between the proletarian ideology and non-proletarian 
ideologies (including those of the petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie 
and even of the landlord class, but mainly of the petty bourgeoisie), 
i.e., the contradiction between the Marxist ideology and non-Marxist 
ideologies  our Party can go forward with great, firm strides in 
unprecedented (though not complete) ideological, political and organizational 
unity. From now on our Party can and should grow even 
larger and, guided by the principles of Marxist ideology, we shall be 
able to steer its further development still more effectively. 
The other link is the movement for production. The War of 
Resistance has been going on for eight years. When it began we had 
food and clothing. But things got steadily worse until we were in 
great difficulty, running short of grain, short of cooking oil and salt, 
short of bedding and clothing, short of funds. This great difficulty, this 
great contradiction, came in the wake of the big Japanese offensives 
and the Kuomintang government¹s three large-scale attacks on the

329 PRODUCTION BY THE ARMY AND RECTIFICATION 
people (the ³anti-Communist onslaughts²) in 1940-43. Could our anti- 
Japanese struggle have progressed if we had not overcome this 
difficulty, solved this contradiction, grasped this link? Obviously not. 
But we have learned and are still learning to develop production, and 
so we are again full of vigour and vitality. Fearing no enemy, we shall 
prevail over them all in a few years. 
Thus there can be no doubt of the historic importance of the two 
great movements for rectification and production. 
Let us go forward and spread these two great movements everywhere 
as a foundation for the fulfilment of other tasks in our struggle. 
If we can do so, the complete liberation of the Chinese people will 
be assured. 
Now is the season for spring ploughing, and it is hoped that the 
leading comrades, all the working personnel and the masses of the 
people in every Liberated Area will grasp the link of production in 
good time and strive for even greater achievements than those of last 
year. Greater efforts must be made this year, particularly in areas 
which have not yet learned to develop production.


THE HURLEY-CHIANG DUET IS A FLOP 
July 10, 1945 
Convened to camouflage Chiang Kai-shek¹s dictatorial regime, the 
Fourth People¹s Political Council opened in Chungking on July 7. It 
was the smallest opening session on record. Not only was nobody 
present from the Chinese Communist Party, but many members of the 
Council from other groups were absent too. Out of a total membership 
of 290, only 180 turned up. Chiang Kai-shek held forth at this opening 
session as follows: 
The government is not going to submit any specific proposal 
on questions relating to the convocation of the National Assembly, 
and you gentlemen can therefore discuss these matters fully. The 
government is ready to listen to your opinions on these questions 
in all honesty and sincerity. 
This will probably be the end of the whole business about convoking 
the National Assembly on November 12 this year. The imperialist 
Patrick J. Hurley has had something to do with this business. At first 
he strongly encouraged Chiang Kai-shek to make such a move, and 
it was this that put some stiffening into Chiang Kai-shek¹s New Year¹s 
Day speech,1 and a great deal more into his March 1 speech2 in which 
he announced his determination to ³hand state power back to the 
people² on November 12. In his speech of March I he flatly rejected 
the Chinese Communist Party¹s proposal, which voiced the general 
will of the Chinese people, that a conference of all parties be convened 
and a coalition government established. He gleefully played up the 
idea of forming a so-called Committee of Three, including an American, 
to ³reorganize² the armed forces of the Chinese Communist Party. 
He had the audacity to say that the Chinese Communist Party must 
hand over its troops before he would bestow ³legal status² upon it. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote this comment for the Hsinhua New Agency.

In all this, the backing of His Worship Patrick J. Hurley was decisive. 
In a statement in Washington on April 2, Hurley did his best to boost 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s ³National Assembly² and other such nasty schemes 
in addition to denying the role of the Chinese Communist Party, 
vilifying its activities, declaring against co-operation with it and uttering 
other such imperialist platitudes. Thus the duet between Hurley 
in the United States and Chiang Kai-shek in China reached its most 
raucous pitch, with the sacrifice of the Chinese people as the common 
objective. Since then the show seems to have flagged. Countless voices 
have been raised in protest everywhere, among both Chinese and 
foreigners, both inside and outside the Kuomintang, among people 
with party affiliations and without. The sole reason is that for all its 
high-sounding language, the Hurley-Chiang racket is designed to 
sacrifice the interests of the Chinese people, further wreck their unity, 
and as it were, lay a mine to set off large-scale civil war in China, 
thereby damaging the common interests of the people of the United 
States and other allied countries during the anti-fascist war and the 
prospects of peaceful coexistence afterwards. At the moment Hurley 
seems to be lying low, busying himself with no one knows what, with 
the result that Chiang Kai-shek has to talk twaddle before the People¹s 
Political Council. Previously, on March 1, Chiang Kai-shek said: 
The conditions in our country differ from those in other 
countries: prior to the convocation of the National Assembly, we 
have no responsible organization which is representative of the 
people and through which the government can consult the people 
for their opinions. 
If that is so, why does our Generalissimo now go to the People¹s 
Political Council to ³listen² to ³opinions²? According to him, there 
is no ³responsible organization² in the whole of China through which 
one ³can consult the people for their opinions²; it follows that the 
People¹s Political Council as an ³organization² exists merely to eat, 
and his ³listening² to it has no legal basis. Be that as it may, if the 
People¹s Political Council says even a single word against the convocation 
of the bogus ³National² Assembly, it will have done a good 
deed and merited divine grace, though by so doing it would have 
violated the Imperial Edict of March 1 and committed lèse-majesté. 
Of course, it is still premature to make any comment on the People¹s 
Political Council, as we have to wait a few days to see what it will 
produce for the Generalissimo to ³listen² to. One thing, however,

333 THE HURLEY-CHIANG DUET IS A FLOP 
is certain: ever since the Chinese people began raising their voices 
in protest against this National Assembly, even the enthusiasts for 
³constitutional monarchy² have been worried about our ³monarch², 
cautioning him not to stick his neck into a noose by convening a 
³Parliament of Pigs²3 and warning him of the fate of Yuan Shih-kai. 
Who knows but that our ³monarch² may stay his hand in consequence? 
But it is absolutely certain that he and his retinue will not allow the 
people to gain a particle of power, if that would cost them a single hair. 
The immediate proof is that His Majesty has described the people¹s 
justified criticism as ³unbridled attacks². He said: 
. . . under war conditions a general election is obviously out of 
the question in the Japanese-occupied areas. Consequently two 
years ago the Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee 
of the Kuomintang resolved to convoke the National Assembly 
and institute constitutional government within a year after the 
conclusion of the war. However, in certain quarters unbridled 
attacks were made at that time. 
And the grounds for these attacks were that this date might be too 
late. His Majesty thereupon proposed that ³the National Assembly be 
convoked as soon as the war situation is stabilized, in view of the 
possibility that the final conclusion of the war may be delayed and 
that order may not be quickly restored everywhere even after the 
end of the war². Much to his surprise, these people again made ³unbridled 
attacks². This has put His Majesty in a terrible fix. But the 
Chinese people must teach Chiang Kai-shek and his group a lesson 
and tell them: Whatever you say or do, no tricks in violation of the 
people¹s wishes will be tolerated. What the Chinese people demand 
is immediate democratic reforms, such as the release of political 
prisoners, the abolition of the secret service, and the granting of freedoms 
to the people and of legal status to the political parties. You 
are doing none of these things and instead are simply juggling with the 
pseudo-problem of the date of the ³National Assembly²; this will 
not deceive even a three-year-old. Without a minimum of genuine 
democratic reforms, all your assemblies, large or small, will be thrown 
into the cesspit. Call this an ³unbridled attack² if you like, but every 
deception of this kind must be exploded resolutely, thoroughly, wholly 
and completely, with not a trace allowed to remain. The reason is 
simply that it is a swindle. Whether or not there is a national assembly 
is one thing and whether or not there is a minimum of democratic

334 MAO TSE-TUNG 
reforms is quite another. The former can be dispensed with for the 
time being, but the latter must be introduced immediately. Since 
Chiang Kai-shek and his group are willing to ³hand state power back 
to the people sooner², why are they unwilling to carry out a minimum 
of democratic reforms ³sooner²? Gentlemen of the Kuomintang! 
When you come to these concluding lines, you will have to admit that 
the Chinese Communists are not in any sense making an ³unbridled 
attack² on you, but are asking you one simple question. May we not 
even ask a question? Can you brush it aside? The question you must 
answer is: How is it that you are willing to ³hand state power back 
to the people² but not willing to institute democratic reforms? 
NOTES 
1 The radio speech made by Chiang Kai-shek on January 1, 1945 d id n ot e ven 
mention the ignominious defeats of the Kuomintang troops at the hands of the 
Japanese aggressors in the previous year, but maligned the people and opposed the 
proposal for abolishing the Kuomintang¹s one-party dictatorship and for setting up 
a coalition government and a joint supreme command, a proposal supported by all 
the people and all the anti-Japanese parties in the country. He insisted on continuing 
the Kuomintang¹s one-party dictatorship and as a shield against the people¹s criticism 
he talked about convening a Kuomintang-controlled ³National Assembly² which had 
been spurned by the whole nation. 
2 On March 1, 1945 Chiang Kai-shek made a speech in Chungking at the Association 
for the Establishment of Constitutional Government. Besides reiterating the 
reactionary views of his New Year¹s Day speech, Chiang proposed the formation of 
a Committee of Three, including a U.S. representative, to ³reorganize² the Eighth 
Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which amounted to an open invitation to 
the U.S. imperialists to intervene in China¹s domestic affairs. 
3 In 1923, the Northern warlord Tsao Kun had himself elected ³President of the 
Republic of China² by giving members of parliament a bribe of 5,000 silver dollars 
each. He became notorious as the president elected through bribery, and the bribed 
members came to be called ³members of the Parliament of Pigs². Comrade Mao 
Tse-tung¹s analogy here likens the Kuomintang¹s bogus ³National Assembly² to the 
³Parliament of Pigs².

ON THE DANGER OF THE HURLEY POLICY 
July 12, 1945 
It has become increasingly obvious that the policy of the United 
States towards China as represented by its ambassador Patrick 
J. Hurley is creating a civil war crisis in China. Sticking to its reactionary 
policies, the Kuomintang government has lived on civil 
war ever since it was set up eighteen years ago; only at the time of 
the Sian Incident in 1936 and of the Japanese invasion south of the 
Great Wall in 1937 was it forced to abandon its nation-wide civil war 
for a time. Since 1939, however, civil war on a local scale has again 
been waged without interruption. ³Fight the Communists first² is the 
mobilization slogan used by the Kuomintang government among its 
own people, while it relegates resistance to Japan to a secondary place. 
At present all its military dispositions are focused not on resisting 
the Japanese aggressors but on ³recovering lost territory² from China¹s 
Liberated Areas and on wiping out the Chinese Communist Party. This 
situation must be taken into serious account in our struggle both for 
victory in the War of Resistance and for peaceful construction after 
the war. The late President Roosevelt did take it into account and 
consequently, in the interests of the United States, refrained from 
adopting a policy of helping the Kuomintang to undertake armed 
attacks on the Chinese Communist Party. When Hurley visited Yenan 
as Roosevelt¹s personal representative in November 1944, he expressed 
agreement with the Chinese Communist Party¹s plan for the abolition 
of the Kuomintang one-party dictatorship and the establishment of 
a democratic coalition government. But later he changed his tune and 
went back on what he had said in Yenan. This change was crudely 
revealed in his statement in Washington on April 2. In the interim, 
according to the selfsame Hurley, the Kuomintang government represented 
by Chiang Kai-shek seems to have turned into the Beauty

and the Chinese Communist Party into the Beast, and he flatly declared 
that the United States would co-operate with Chiang Kai-shek only 
and not with the Chinese Communist Party. This, of course, is not 
just Hurley¹s personal view but that of a whole group of people in the 
U.S. government. It is a wrong and dangerous view. At this juncture 
Roosevelt died, and Hurley returned to the U.S. embassy in Chungking 
in high spirits. The danger of the China policy of the United States as 
represented by Hurley is that it is encouraging the Kuomintang government 
to be still more reactionary and aggravating the civil war 
crisis. If the Hurley policy continues, the U.S. government will fall 
irretrievably into the deep stinking cesspool of Chinese reaction; it 
will put itself in the position of antagonizing the hundreds of millions 
of awakened and awakening Chinese people and will become a 
hindrance to the War of Resistance in the present and to world peace 
in the future. Isn¹t it clear that this would be the inevitable result? A 
section of U.S. public opinion is worried about the China policy of 
the Hurley type with its dangers and wants it changed, because as 
far as China¹s future is concerned, it sees clearly that the forces of the 
Chinese people which demand independence, freedom and unity are 
irresistible and are bound to burst forth and supplant foreign and 
feudal oppression. We cannot yet say whether or when the U.S. policy 
will be changed. But one thing is certain. If the Hurley policy of aiding 
and abetting the reactionary forces in China and antagonizing the 
Chinese people with their immense numbers continues unchanged, 
it will place a crushing burden on the government and people of the 
United States and plunge them into endless trouble. This point must 
be brought home to the people of the United States.

ON THE DANGER OF THE HURLEY POLICY 
July 29, 1945 
Comrade William Z. Foster and the National Committee of the Communist 
Party of the United States of America: 
We are glad to learn that the special convention of the Communist 
Political Association of the United States has resolved to repudiate 
Browder¹s revisionist, that is, capitulationist line,1 has re-established 
Marxist leadership and revived the Communist Party of the United 
States. We hereby extend to you our warm congratulations on this 
great victory of the working class and the Marxist movement in the 
United States. Browder¹s whole revisionist-capitulationist line (which 
is fully expressed in his book Teheran) in essence reflects the influence 
of reactionary U.S. capitalist groups on the U.S. workers¹ movement. 
These groups are now doing their utmost to extend their influence in 
China too; they are supporting the erroneous policy of the reactionary 
clique inside the Kuomintang, a policy which is against the interests 
of the nation and the people, and are thereby confronting the 
Chinese people with the grave danger of civil war and jeopardizing 
the interests of the peoples of our two great countries, China and the 
United States. Beyond all doubt the victory of the U.S. working class 
and its vanguard, the Communist Party of the United States, over 
Browder¹s revisionist-capitulationist line will contribute signally to 
the great cause in which the Chinese and American peoples are engaged, 
the cause of carrying on the war against Japan and of building a peaceful 
and democratic world after the war. 
NOTES 
1 Earl Browder was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United 
States of America from 1930 to 1944. During World War II, the Rightist ideas in the 
Communist Party of the U.S.A., of which Browder was the chief exponent, developed

338 MAO TSE-TUNG 
into an anti-Marxist revisionist-capitulationist line. From December 1943 onward, 
Browder advocated this line in a number of speeches and articles and in April 1944 
he published Teheran as his Right opportunist programme. Revising the basic Leninist 
thesis that imperialism is monopolistic, decadent and moribund capitalism, and denying 
the imperialist nature of U.S. capitalism, he declared that U.S. capitalism ³retains 
some of the characteristics of a young capitalism² (Browder¹s italics) and that there 
is a ³common interest² between the proletariat and the big bourgeoisie in the U.S.A. 
Thus he pleaded for the safeguarding of the system of monopolist trusts and dreamed 
about saving U.S. capitalism from inevitable crises by means of class conciliation. 
Basing himself on this absurd appraisal of U.S. capitalism and following a capitulationist 
line of class collaboration with monopoly capital, Browder in May 1944 
presided over the dissolution of the Communist Party of the U.S.A., the party of 
the U.S. proletariat, and formed a non-Party organization, the Communist Political 
Association of the U.S.A. From the very beginning, Browder¹s wrong line met with 
opposition from many members of the Communist Party of the U.S.A. with Comrade 
William Z. Poster at their head. Under the leadership of Comrade Foster, the Communist 
Political Association in June 1945 passed a resolution denouncing Browder¹s 
Iine. In July the association held a special national convention and decided on the 
thorough liquidation of this Iine and the re-establishment of the Communist Party 
of the U.S.A. Browder was expelled from the Party in February 1946 because he 
persisted in his stand, which was a betrayal of the proletariat, and because he openly 
supported the imperialist policy of the Truman Administration and engaged in 
factional activities against the Party.

THE LAST ROUND 
WITH THE JAPANESE INVADERS 
June 9, 1945 
The Chinese people heartily welcome the Soviet government¹s 
declaration of war on Japan on August 8. The Soviet Union¹s action 
will very much shorten the war against Japan. The war is already in 
its last stage and the time has come to inflict final defeat on the Japanese 
aggressors and all their running dogs. In these circumstances, all 
the anti-Japanese forces of the Chinese people should launch a nationwide 
counter-offensive in close and effective co-ordination with the 
operations of the Soviet Union and the other allied countries. The 
Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and the other armed 
forces of the people should seize every opportunity to launch extensive 
attacks on all the invaders and their running dogs who refuse to 
surrender, annihilate their forces, capture their arms and matériel, 
vigorously expand the Liberated Areas and reduce the areas under 
enemy occupation. We must boldly form armed working teams which, 
by hundreds and by thousands, should penetrate deep into the rear of 
the enemy-occupied areas, organize the people to wreck the enemy¹s 
communication lines and fight in co-ordination with the regular armies. 
We must boldly arouse the people in the occupied areas in their tens 
of millions and immediately organize underground forces to prepare 
armed uprisings and to annihilate the enemy in co-ordination with the 
troops attacking from without. Meanwhile, the consolidation of the 
Liberated Areas must not be neglected. Among the 100 million people 
there, and among the people in all other areas as they are liberated, 
we should universally carry out the reduction of rent and interest this 
winter and next spring, increase production, build up the people¹s 
political power and armed forces, intensify militia work, strengthen 
army discipline, persistently develop the united front of all sections 
of the people and guard against waste of manpower and material 
339

340
resources. All this is designed to put more punch into our army¹s 
offensive against the enemy. The people of the whole country must 
be on their guard to avert the danger of civil war and make efforts 
to bring about the formation of a democratic coalition government. 
A new stage in China¹s war of national liberation has arrived, and 
the people of the whole country must strengthen their unity and 
struggle for final victory.
