REVOLUTIONARY CIVIL WAR 
PERIOD


THE SITUATION AND OUR POLICY 
AFTER THE VICTORY IN THE WAR OF 
RESISTANCE AGAINST JAPAN* 
August 13, 1945 
These are days of tremendous change in the situation in the Far 
East. The surrender of Japanese imperialism is now a foregone conclusion. 
The decisive factor for Japan¹s surrender is the entry of 
the Soviet Union into the war. A million Red Army troops are 
entering China¹s Northeast; this force is irresistible. Japanese imperialism 
can no longer continue the fight.1 The Chinese people¹s 
hard and bitter War of Resistance is crowned with victory. As a 
historical stage, the War of Resistance Against Japan is now over. 
In these circumstances, what are the relations among the different 
classes in China and what are the relations between the Kuomintang 
and the Communist Party at present? What will they be like in 
the future? What is the policy of our Party? These are questions 
of great concern to the people of the whole country and to all members 
of our Party. 
What about the Kuomintang? Look at its past, and you can tell its 
present; look at its past and present, and you can tell its future. In the 
past, this party carried on a counter-revolutionary civil war for ten 
whole years. During the War of Resistance it launched three largescale 
anti-Communist campaigns,2 in 1940, 1941 and 1943, each time 
attempting to develop the attack into a country-wide civil war. It was 
only because of the correct policy adopted by our Party and the opposition 
of the people of the whole country that its attempts failed. 
As everyone knows, Chiang Kai-shek, the political representative 
of China¹s big landlords and big bourgeoisie, is a most brutal and 
treacherous fellow. His policy has been to look on with folded 
arms, wait for victory, conserve his forces and prepare for civil war. 
Indeed, the victory he has been waiting for has arrived, and now 
11

12 MAO TSE-TUNG 
this ³generalissimo² is about to ³come down from the mountain².3 
In the past eight years we have changed places with Chiang Kai-shek ‹ 
formerly we were on the mountain and he was by the water;4 during 
the War of Resistance we were behind the enemy lines and he went up 
the mountain. Now he is coming down from the mountain, coming 
down to seize the fruits of victory. 
During the past eight years the people and army of our Liberated 
Areas, receiving no aid whatsoever from outside and relying solely 
on their own efforts, liberated vast territories and resisted and pinned 
down the bulk of the Japanese invading forces and practically all 
the puppet troops. Only by our determined resistance and heroic 
struggle were the 200 million people in the Great Rear Area5 saved 
from being trampled underfoot by the Japanese aggressors and the 
regions inhabited by these 200 million people saved from Japanese 
occupation. Chiang Kai-shek hid on Mount Omei with guards in 
front of him ‹ the guards were the Liberated Areas, the people and 
army of the Liberated Areas. In defending the 200 million people 
of the Great Rear Area, we protected this ³generalissimo² as well 
and gave him both the time and the space to sit around waiting for 
victory with folded arms. Time ‹ eight years one month. Space ‹ an 
area inhabited by 200 million people. These conditions we provided 
for him. But for us, he could not have stood by looking on. Is 
the ³generalissimo² grateful to us, then? No, not he! This fellow has 
never known what it is to be grateful. How did Chiang Kai-shek 
climb to power? By the Northern Expedition,6 by the first period 
of co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party,7 
by the support given him by the people, who had not yet seen 
through him. Once in power, Chiang Kai-shek, far from being 
* This speech was delivered by Comrade Mao Tse-tung at a meeting of cadres 
in Yenan. Based on the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis, it presented a 
penetrating study of the fundamental political situation in China after victory in the 
War of Resistance Against Japan and set forth the revolutionary tactics of the proletariat. 
As Comrade Mao Tse-tung had pointed out in his opening address at the Seventh 
National Congress of the Communist Party of China in April 1945, China after defeating 
Japanese imperialism still faced two destinies, two futures ‹ either to become a new 
China or to remain the old China. The big landlords and big bourgeoisie of China, 
represented by Chiang Kai-shek, wanted to wrest the fruits of victory in the War of 
Resistance from the hands of the people and to keep China a semi-colonial and semifeudal 
country under their dictatorship. The Communist Party of China, representing 
the interests of the proletariat and the masses of the people, on the one hand strove 
for peace and opposed civil war with all its strength. On the other hand, it had to 
prepare fully against Chiang Kai-shek¹s counter-revolutionary plot of launching a

13 SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER VICTORY OVER JAPAN 
grateful to the people, knocked them down and plunged them into 
the bloodbath of ten years of civil war. You comrades are familiar 
with this segment of history. During the present War of Resistance 
the Chinese people again defended him. This war is now ending 
in victory and Japan is on the point of surrender, but he is not at 
all grateful to the people. On the contrary, thumbing through the 
records of 1927, he wants to act in the same old way.8 He says 
there has never been any ³civil war² in China, only ³bandit suppression². 
Whatever he likes to call it, the fact is he wants to start a 
civil war against the people, he wants to slaughter the people. 
Until a civil war breaks out all over the country, many of the 
people and many of our Party comrades will not have a very clear 
understanding of this question. Since civil war is not yet here on a 
large scale, since it is not yet widespread or out in the open and 
since the battles are not yet numerous, many people think, ³Well, 
there may not be a civil war after all!² Many others are afraid of 
civil war. Their fear is not without reason. There were ten years 
of fighting and then another eight years of the War of Resistance; 
if the fighting keeps on, where will it all end? It is quite natural that 
such fears should arise. With regard to Chiang Kai-shek¹s plot to 
launch a civil war, our Party¹s policy has been clear and consistent, 
that is, resolutely to oppose civil war, be against civil war and 
prevent civil war. In the days to come, we shall continue, with the 
utmost effort and greatest patience, to lead the people in preventing 
civil war. Nevertheless, it is necessary to be soberly aware that the 
danger of civil war is extremely serious because Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
policy is already set. Chiang Kai-shek¹s policy is civil war. Our policy, 
the policy of the people, is against civil war. The opponents of civil war 
country-wide civil war and had to adopt the correct policy, that is to say, to harbour 
no illusions about imperialism and reaction, to have no fear of their threats, to 
resolutely safeguard the fruits of the people¹s struggle and strive to build a new China ‹ 
a new-democratic China of the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the 
proletariat. The decisive struggle between the two destinies, the two futures facing 
China, constituted the content of the historical period from the conclusion of the War 
of Resistance Against Japan to the founding of the People¹s Republic of China, the 
historical period of the Chinese People¹s War of Liberation or Third Revolutionary 
Civil War. After the War of Resistance, Chiang Kai-shek, supported by U.S. 
imperialism, tore up peace agreements again and again and launched a gigantic 
counter-revolutionary civil war without parallel in history in an attempt to wipe out the 
people¹s forces. Because of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China 
it took the Chinese people only four years of struggle to win a great country-wide 
victory ‹ the overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek and the creation of a new China.

14 MAO TSE-TUNG 
consist only of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people ‹ 
it is a pity that they do not include Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. 
Here one side does not want to fight and the other does. If both 
did not want it, there would be no fighting. Now, since only one side 
is against it and this side is not yet strong enough to check the other, 
the danger of civil war is extremely grave. 
Our Party pointed out in good time that Chiang Kai-shek would 
stick to his reactionary policy of dictatorship and civil war. Before, 
during and after the Seventh Party Congress,9 we did fairly adequate 
work to call the people¹s attention to the danger of civil war, so 
that the whole people, our Party members and our troops should be 
mentally prepared well in advance. This is a very important point, 
and it makes a world of difference whether or not there is such preparedness. 
In 1927 our Party was still in its infancy and was mentally 
wholly unprepared for Chiang Kai-shek¹s counter-revolutionary surprise 
attack. Consequently the fruits of victory won by the people 
were soon lost, the people had to undergo long suffering, and a 
bright China was plunged into darkness. This time things are 
different; our Party has acquired the rich experience of three revolutions10 
and a much higher degree of political maturity. Time and 
again, the Central Committee of the Party has clearly explained the 
danger of civil war, and so the whole people, all Party members and 
the troops led by our Party are in a state of preparedness. 
Chiang Kai-shek always tries to wrest every ounce of power and 
every ounce of gain from the people. And we? Our policy is to 
give him tit for tat and to fight for every inch of land. We act 
after his fashion. He always tries to impose war on the people, 
one sword in his left hand and another in his right. We take up 
swords, too, following his example. We found this method only 
after investigation and study. Such investigation and study are very 
important. When we see the other fellow holding something in his 
hands, we should do some investigating. What does he hold in his 
hands? Swords. What are swords for? For killing. Whom does 
he want to kill with his swords? The people. Having made these 
findings, investigate further-the Chinese people, too, have hands 
and can take up swords, they can forge a sword if there is none 
handy. The Chinese people have discovered this truth after long 
investigation and study. Warlords, landlords, local bullies and bad 
gentry and the imperialists all have swords in their hands and are 
out to kill. The people have come to understand this and so act

15 SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER VICTORY OVER JAPAN 
after the same fashion. Some of us often neglect such investigation 
and study. Chen Tu-hsiu,11 for example, did not understand that 
with swords one can kill people. Some say, this is a plain everyday 
truth; how can a leader of the Communist Party fail to know it? 
But you never can tell. Chen Tu-hsiu made no investigation and 
study and so did not understand this, hence we called him an opportunist. 
He who makes no investigation and study has no right to 
speak, and accordingly we deprived Chen Tu-hsiu of that right. We 
have adopted a course different from Chen Tu-hsiu¹s and enabled the 
people suffering from oppression and slaughter to take up swords. 
If ever again anybody wants to kill us, we will act after his fashion. 
Not long ago, the Kuomintang sent six divisions to attack our Kuanchung 
sub-region, and three of them drove in and seized an area 
measuring 20 by 100 li. We acted after their fashion and wholly, 
thoroughly and completely wiped out the Kuomintang troops in this 
area of 20 by 100 li.12 Our policy is to give tit for tat and fight 
for every inch of land; we will never let the Kuomintang easily 
seize our land and kill our people. Of course, to fight for every 
inch of land does not mean following the old ³Left² line of ³not 
abandoning a single inch of land in the base area².13 This time we 
abandoned an area of 20 by 100 li. Abandoned late in July, it was 
retaken early in August. After the Southern Anhwei Incident of 
1941,14 the Kuomintang liaison staff officer once asked me what we 
intended to do. I answered, ³You are here in Yenan all the time 
and you don¹t know? If Ho goes for us, we¹ll go for him. If Ho 
stops, we¹ll stop too.²15 At that time Chiang Kai-shek was not named, 
only Ho Ying-chin. Today we say, ³If Chiang goes for us, we¹ll go 
for him. If Chiang stops, we¹ll stop too.² We will act after his fashion. 
As Chiang Kai-shek is now sharpening his swords, we must sharpen 
ours too. 
The rights the people have won must never be lightly given up 
but must be defended by fighting. We don¹t want civil war. However, 
if Chiang Kai-shek insists on forcing civil war on the Chinese 
people, the only thing we can do is to take up arms and fight him 
in self-defence to protect the lives and property, the rights and wellbeing 
of the people of the Liberated Areas. This will be a civil 
war he forces on us. If we do not win, we will blame neither 
heaven nor earth but only ourselves. However, let no one think 
that the people can be easily robbed or defrauded of the rights they 
have won; that is impossible. Last year an American correspondent

16 MAO TSE-TUNG 
asked me, ³Who has given you the power to act?² I replied, ³The 
people.² Who else indeed, if not the people? The ruling Kuomintang 
hasn¹t given us any power. It doesn¹t recognize us. We 
take part in the People¹s Political Council in the capacity of a ³cultural 
organization²16 as stipulated by its rules. But we are not a 
³cultural organization², we say, we have an army and are a ³military 
organization². On March 1 this year Chiang Kai-shek stated that 
the Communist Party would have to turn over its army before it could 
acquire legal status. Chiang Kai-shek¹s statement still stands. We 
have not turned over our army, and so we have no legal status and are 
³defying laws human and divine². Our duty is to hold ourselves 
responsible to the people. Every word, every act and every policy 
must conform to the people¹s interests, and if mistakes occur, they 
must be corrected ‹ that is what being responsible to the people 
means. Comrades! The people want liberation and therefore entrust 
power to those who can represent them and work faithfully 
for them, that is, to us Communists. As representatives of the 
people, we must represent them well and not act like Chen Tu-hsiu. 
Confronted by counter-revolutionary attacks against the people, 
Chen Tu-hsiu did not adopt the policy of giving tit for tat and 
fighting for every inch of land; as a result, in 1927, within the space 
of a few months, he forfeited all the rights the people had won. 
This time we must be on our guard. Our policy is absolutely different 
from Chen Tu-hsiu¹s; no trickery can fool us. We must be clearheaded 
and have a correct policy; we must not make mistakes. 
To whom should the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance 
belong? It is very obvious. Take a peach tree for example. When 
the tree yields peaches they are the fruits of victory. Who is entitled 
to pick the peaches? Ask who planted and watered the tree. 
Chiang Kai-shek squatting on the mountain did not carry a single 
bucket of water, and yet he is now stretching out his arm from 
afar to pick the peaches. ³I, Chiang Kai-shek, own these peaches,² 
he says, ³I am the landlord, you are my serfs and I won¹t allow you 
to pick any.² We have refuted him in the press.17 We say, ³You 
never carried any water, so you have no right to pick the peaches. 
We the people of the Liberated Areas watered the tree day in day 
out and have the most right to gather the fruit.² Comrades! The 
victory of the War of Resistance has been won by the people with 
bloodshed and sacrifice, it should be the victory of the people and 
it is to the people that the fruits of the War of Resistance should go.

17 SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER VICTORY OVER JAPAN 
As for Chiang Kai-shek, he was passive in resisting Japan but active 
in anti-communism. He was a stumbling-block in the people¹s War of 
Resistance. Now this stumbling-block is coming forward to monopolize 
the fruits of victory, wants China after victory to relapse into 
her old pre-war state and does not tolerate the slightest change. This 
gives rise to struggle. Comrades! It is a most serious struggle. 
That the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance should go to 
the people is one thing, but who will eventually get them and 
whether it will be the people is another. Don¹t be too sure that all 
the fruits of victory will fall into the hands of the people. Chiang 
Kai-shek will grab a lot of big peaches, such as Shanghai, Nanking, 
Hangchow and other big cities. He has ganged up with U.S. imperialism 
and in those places they have the upper hand, while so far 
the revolutionary people can by and large occupy only the rural areas. 
Another bunch of peaches will be contested by both sides. These are 
the medium and small towns situated along the section of the 
Tatung-Puchow Railway north of Taiyuan, the middle section of the 
Peiping-Suiyuan Railway, the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, the section 
of the Peiping-Hankow Railway north of Chengchow, the Chengting- 
Taiyuan Railway, the Paikuei-Chincheng Railway,18 the Tehchow- 
Shihchiachuang Railway, the Tientsin-Pukow Railway, the Tsingtao- 
Tsinan Railway and the section of the Lunghai Railway east of 
Chengchow. These medium and small towns must be contested; they 
are the medium and small peaches watered by the people of the 
Liberated Areas with their sweat and blood. It is difficult to say 
now whether these places will fall into the people¹s hands. Only 
two words can be said now: struggle hard. Are there places which 
are sure to fall into the hands of the people? Yes, there are. They 
are the vast rural areas and the numerous towns in the provinces of 
Hopei, Chahar and Jehol,19 most of Shansi, Shantung and the 
northern part of Kiangsu, with villages linked together and with 
about a hundred towns in one area, seventy to eighty in another, 
forty to fifty in a third ‹ altogether three, four, five or six such areas, 
big and small. What sort of towns? Medium and small towns. We 
are sure of them, we have the strength to pick these fruits of victory. 
In the history of the Chinese revolution this will be the first time 
that we have got such a bunch of fruit. Historically, it was only 
after we smashed the enemy¹s third ³encirclement and suppression² 
campaign20 in the latter half of 1931 that we had altogether as many as 
twenty-one county towns21 in the Central Base Area in Kiangsi

18 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Province, but there was not a single medium-sized town among them. 
With twenty-one small towns linked together, the total population at 
its height reached 2,500,000. Relying on this base, the Chinese people 
were able to continue the struggle for such a long time, win such big 
victories and smash such big ³encirclement and suppression² campaigns. 
Later we were defeated, for which we should blame, not 
Chiang Kai-shek, but ourselves for not fighting well enough. This 
time, if scores of big and small towns are linked in a single contiguous 
area and if there are three, four, five or six such areas, then 
the Chinese people will have three, four, five or six revolutionary 
bases, each larger than the Central Base Area in Kiangsi Province, 
and the situation for the Chinese revolution will be very promising 
indeed. 
If one looks at the situation as a whole, the stage of the War of 
Resistance Against Japan is over and the new situation and task 
is domestic struggle. Chiang Kai-shek talks about ³building the 
country². From now on the struggle will be, build what sort of 
country? To build a new-democratic country of the broad masses 
of the people under the leadership of the proletariat? Or to build 
a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country under the dictatorship of the 
big landlords and the big bourgeoisie? This will be a most complicated 
struggle. At present it takes the form of a struggle between 
Chiang Kai-shek who is trying to usurp the fruits of victory of the 
War of Resistance and ourselves who oppose his usurpation. If there 
is any opportunism during this period, it will lie in failing to struggle 
hard and in making a voluntary gift to Chiang Kai-shek of the fruits 
which should go to the people. 
Will an open and total civil war break out? That depends on 
internal and international factors. The internal factors consist chiefly 
of our strength and the degree of our political consciousness. Given 
the general trend of the international and internal situation and the 
feelings of the people, is it possible, through our own struggles, to 
localize the civil war or delay the outbreak of a country-wide civil 
war? There is this possibility. 
Chiang Kai-shek will face many difficulties if he tries to let loose a 
civil war. First, in the Liberated Areas there are a hundred million 
people, a million troops and over two million people¹s militia. Second, 
the politically conscious people in the Kuomintang areas are against 
civil war, and this is some kind of check on Chiang Kai-shek. Third, 
inside the Kuomintang also there is a section which is not in favour

19 SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER VICTORY OVER JAPAN 
of civil war. The situation today is vastly different from that in 1927. 
In particular, the condition of our Party today is vastly different from 
what it was in 1927. In those days our Party was still in its infancy 
and did not have a clear head or experience in armed struggle or the 
policy of giving tit for tat. Today the level of political consciousness 
in our Party is very much higher. 
Apart from our own political consciousness, the political consciousness 
of the vanguard of the proletariat, there is the question of the 
political consciousness of the masses of the people. When the people 
are not yet politically conscious, it is entirely possible that their 
revolutionary gains may be handed over to others. This happened 
in the past. Today the level of political consciousness of the Chinese 
people is likewise very much higher. The prestige of our Party 
among the people has never been so great. Nevertheless, among the 
people, and chiefly among those living in the Japanese-occupied and 
Kuomintang areas, there are still a good many who believe in Chiang 
Kai-shek and have illusions about the Kuomintang and the United 
States of America, illusions which Chiang Kai-shek is working hard 
to spread. The fact that a section of the Chinese people is not yet 
politically conscious shows that much remains to be done in our 
propaganda and organizational work. The political awakening of 
the people is not easy. It requires much earnest effort on our part 
to rid their minds of wrong ideas. We should sweep backward ideas 
from the minds of the Chinese people, just as we sweep our rooms. 
Dust never vanishes of itself without sweeping. We must carry on 
extensive propaganda and education among the masses, so they will 
understand the real situation and trend in China and have confidence 
in their own strength. 
It is up to us to organize the people. As for the reactionaries in 
China, it is up to us to organize the people to overthrow them. 
Everything reactionary is the same; if you don¹t hit it, it won¹t fall. 
It is like sweeping the floor; where the broom does not reach, 
the dust never vanishes of itself. There is a river called the Chiehtse, 
south of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. South of 
the river is Lochuan County and north of it, Fuhsien County. North 
and south of the river are two different worlds. The south is under 
the Kuomintang; since we have not reached there, the people are 
unorganized, and there is much filth and rottenness. Some of our 
comrades put their faith only in political influence, fancying that 
problems can be solved merely by influence. That is blind faith. In

20 MAO TSE-TUNG 
1936, we were in Pao-an.22 Forty to fifty li away, there was a fortified 
village held by a landlord despot. The Central Committee of the 
Party was then in Pao-an and our political influence could be considered 
very great indeed, but the counter-revolutionaries in this 
village obstinately refused to surrender. We swept to the south, we 
swept to the north, all in vain. Not until our broom swept right 
into the village did the landlord cry out, ³Ow, I give up!²23 That is 
how things are in this world. Bells don¹t ring till you strike them. 
Tables don¹t move till you shift them. Japan would not surrender 
until after the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered northeastern 
China. The enemy and puppet troops never handed over their arms 
until our troops fought them. Only where the broom reaches can 
political influence produce its full effect. Our broom is the Communist 
Party, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Broom 
in hand, you must learn to sweep; don¹t lie in bed, fancying that a 
gust of wind will somehow rise and blow all the dust away. We 
Marxists are revolutionary realists and never indulge in idle dreams. 
There is an old saying in China, ³Rise at dawn and sweep the courtyard.²
24 Dawn is the breaking of a new day. Our forefathers told 
us to rise and start sweeping at the very break of day. They were 
setting us a task. Only by thinking and acting in this way will we 
benefit and find work to do. China has a vast territory, and it is up 
to us to sweep it clean inch by inch. 
On what basis should our policy rest? It should rest on our own 
strength, and that means regeneration through one¹s own efforts. We 
are not alone; all the countries and people in the world opposed to 
imperialism are our friends. Nevertheless, we stress regeneration 
through our own efforts. Relying on the forces we ourselves organize, 
we can defeat all Chinese and foreign reactionaries. Chiang Kai-shek, 
on the contrary, relies entirely on the aid of U.S. imperialism, which 
he looks upon as his mainstay. The trinity of dictatorship, civil war 
and selling out the country has always been the basis of his policy. 
U.S. imperialism wants to help Chiang Kai-shek wage civil war and 
turn China into a U.S. dependency, and this policy, too, was set long 
ago. But U.S. imperialism while outwardly strong is inwardly weak. 
We must be clear-headed, that is, we must not believe the ³nice 
words² of the imperialists nor be intimidated by their bluster. An 
American once said to me, ³You should listen to Hurley and send 
a few men to be officials in the Kuomintang government.²25 I replied: 
³It is no easy job to be an official bound hand and foot; we won¹t

21 SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER VICTORY OVER JAPAN 
do it. If we become officials, our hands and feet must be unfettered, 
we must be free to act, that is, a coalition government must be set 
up on a democratic basis.² He said, ³It will be bad if you don¹t.² 
I asked him, ³Why bad?² He said, ³First, the Americans will curse 
you; secondly, the Americans will back Chiang Kai-shek.² I 
replied: ³If you Americans, sated with bread and sleep, want to 
curse people and back Chiang Kai-shek, that¹s your business and 
I won¹t interfere. What we have now is millet plus rifles, what you 
have is bread plus cannon. If you like to back Chiang Kai-shek, back 
him, back him as long as you want. But remember one thing. To 
whom does China belong? China definitely does not belong to 
Chiang Kai-shek, China belongs to the Chinese people. The day will 
surely come when you will find it impossible to back him any longer.² 
Comrades! This American was trying to scare people. Imperialists 
are masters at this sort of stuff, and many people in the colonial 
countries do get scared. The imperialists think that all people in the 
colonial countries can be scared, but they do not realize that in China 
there are people who are not afraid of that sort of stuff. In the past 
we have openly criticized and exposed the U.S. policy of aiding 
Chiang Kai-shek to fight the Communists; it was necessary, and we 
shall continue to do so. 
The Soviet Union has sent its troops, the Red Army has come 
to help the Chinese people drive out the aggressor; such an event 
has never happened before in Chinese history. Its influence is immeasurable. 
The propaganda organs of the United States and Chiang 
Kai-shek hoped to sweep away the Red Army¹s political influence 
with two atom bombs.26 But it can¹t be swept away; that isn¹t so 
easy. Can atom bombs decide wars? No, they can¹t. Atom bombs 
could not make Japan surrender. Without the struggles waged by 
the people, atom bombs by themselves would be of no avail. If 
atom bombs could decide the war, then why was it necessary to ask 
the Soviet Union to send its troops? Why didn¹t Japan surrender 
when the two atom bombs were dropped on her and why did she 
surrender as soon as the Soviet Union sent troops? Some of our 
comrades, too, believe that the atom bomb is all-powerful; that is a 
big mistake. These comrades show even less judgement than a 
British peer. There is a certain British peer called Lord Mountbatten. 
He said the worst possible mistake is to think that the atom bomb 
can decide the war.27 These comrades are more backward than 
Mountbatten. What influence has made these comrades look upon

22 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the atom bomb as something miraculous? Bourgeois influence. Where 
does it come from? From their education in bourgeois schools, from 
the bourgeois press and news agencies. There are two world outlooks 
and two methodologies, the proletarian world outlook and methodology 
and the bourgeois world outlook and methodology. These 
comrades often cling to the bourgeois world outlook and methodology 
and often forget the proletarian world outlook and methodology. The 
theory that ³weapons decide everything², the purely military viewpoint, 
a bureaucratic style of work divorced from the masses, individualist 
thinking, and the like ‹ all these are bourgeois influences 
in our ranks. We must constantly sweep these bourgeois things out 
of our ranks just as we sweep out dust. 
The entry of the Soviet Union into the war has decided Japan¹s 
surrender and the situation in China is entering a new period. Between 
the War of Resistance and the new period there is a transitional 
stage. The struggle during this transitional stage is to oppose Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s usurpation of the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance. 
Chiang Kai-shek wants to launch a country-wide civil war and his 
policy is set; we must be prepared for this. No matter when this 
country-wide civil war breaks out, we must be well prepared. If it 
comes early, say, tomorrow morning, we should also be prepared. 
That is point one. In the present international and domestic situation 
it is possible that for a time the civil war may be kept restricted 
in scale and localized. That is point two. Point one is what we 
should prepare for, point two is what has existed for a long time. 
In short, we must be prepared. Being prepared, we shall be able 
to deal properly with all kinds of complicated situations. 
NOTES 
1 On August 8, 1945, the Soviet government declared war on Japan. On August 
10 the Mongolian government declared war on Japan. The Soviet Red Army moved 
by land and sea into China¹s Northeast and into Korea and swiftly routed the Japanese 
Kwantung Army. The joint Soviet-Mongolian armies crossed the Inner Mongolian 
desert and entered Jehol and Chahar Provinces. On August 10 the Japanese government 
was compelled to send a note begging to surrender and on the 14th it formally 
announced its unconditional surrender. The Kwantung Army was the cream of the 
main force of the Japanese army and constituted Japan¹s general strategic reserve. 
The Japanese imperialists had dreamed of relying on this force to carry on a longdrawn-
out war from their favourable strategic position in China¹s Northeast and in

23 SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER VICTORY OVER JAPAN 
Korea. This scheme was completely wrecked by the entry of the Soviet Union into 
the war, and the Japanese government had to admit defeat and surrender. 
2 For details, see ³A Comment on the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang¹s 
Central Executive Committee and the Second Session of the Third People¹s 
Political Council², Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. III. 
3 ³Mountain² here refers to Mount Omei in Szechuan Province and more generally 
to the mountainous areas in southwestern and northwestern China. After Wuhan 
was occupied by the Japanese army in 1938, Chiang Kai-shek and the main force under 
his command took refuge in these mountainous areas and sat there watching the bitter 
struggle against the Japanese aggressors which was being waged behind the enemy 
lines by the army and people of the Liberated Areas. 
4 Prior to the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of the revolutionary base 
areas led by the Communist Party of China were in mountainous regions. At that 
time Chiang Kai-shek¹s rule was centred in the large cities along the big rivers and 
the coast. Accordingly, Comrade Mao Tse-tung said ³we were on the mountain and 
he was by the water². 
5 During the War of Resistance the front lines were in northern, eastern, central 
and southern China. People usually referred to the Kuomintang areas in southwestern 
and northwestern China which were not occupied by the Japanese invaders as the 
Great Rear Area. 
6 The Northern Expedition was the punitive war against the Northern warlords 
launched by the revolutionary army which marched north from Kwangtung Province 
in May-July 1926. The Northern Expeditionary Army, with the Communist Party 
of China taking part in its leadership and under the Party¹s influence (the political work 
in the army was at that time mostly under the charge of Communist Party members), 
gained the warm support of the broad masses of workers and peasants. In the second 
half of 1926 and the first half of 1927 it occupied most of the provinces along the Yangtse 
and Yellow Rivers and defeated the Northern warlords. In April 1927 this revolutionary 
war failed as a result of betrayal by the reactionary clique under Chiang 
Kai-shek within the revolutionary army. 
7 In 1924, with the help of the Communist Party of China, Sun Yat-sen reorganized 
the Kuomintang and effected co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist 
Party. The Revolutionary War of 1924-27 was launched on the basis of this cooperation. 
This first co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party 
was wrecked as a result of betrayals by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei in 1927. 
8 This refers to Chiang Kai-shek¹s betrayal of the revolution in 1927. After 
betraying the revolution, Chiang Kai-shek massacred great numbers of Communists, 
workers, peasants and revolutionary intellectuals and unleashed a counter-revolutionary 
war against the revolutionary masses. 
9 This Congress was held in Yenan in April 1945 It was there that Comrade 
Mao Tse-tung delivered the political report ³On Coalition Government² (see Selected 
Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. III). 
10 The first revolution was the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal revolutionary struggle 
waged from 1924 to 1927 by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist 
Party of China; the Northern Expedition was the main content of this revolution. 
The second revolution was the revolutionary struggle from 1927 to 1937 to create and 
develop Red political power. The third revolution was the War of Resistance Against 
Japan from 1937 to 1945. 
11 Chen Tu-hsiu was originally a professor at Peking University and became 
famous as an editor of New Youth. He was one of the founders of the Communist

24 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Party of China. Owing to his reputation at the time of the May 4th Movement and 
owing to the Party¹s immaturity in its initial period, he became General Secretary 
of the Party. In the last period of the revolution of 1924-27, the Rightist thinking in 
the Party represented by Chen Tu-hsiu developed into a line of capitulationism. In 
³The Present Situation and Our Tasks², Comrade Mao Tse-tung said that the 
capitulationists at that time ³voluntarily gave up the Party¹s leadership of the peasant 
masses, urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and in particular gave up the 
Party¹s leadership of the armed forces, thus causing the defeat of the revolution² 
(p. 171 of this volume). After the defeat in 1927 Chen Tu-hsiu and a handful of other 
capitulationists lost faith in the future of the revolution and became liquidationists. 
They took the reactionary Trotskyist stand and together with the Trotskyites formed a 
small anti-Party group. Consequently Chen Tu-hsiu was expelled from the Party 
in November 1929. He died in 1942. With reference to Chen Tu-hsiu¹s Right 
opportunism, see the introductory notes to ³Analysis of the Classes in Chinese 
Society² and to ³Report on the Investigation into the Peasant Movement in Hunan², 
Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. I, and ³Introducing The Communist², Selected 
Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. II. 
12 On July 21, 1945, the Provisional 59th Division and 2nd Cavalry Division under 
Hu Tsung-nan, Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 1st War Zone, suddenly attacked 
Yehtai Mountain in Chunhua County in the Kuanchung sub-region of the Shensi-Kansu- 
Ningsia Border Region. On July 23 Hu Tsung-nan sent his 3rd Reserve Division to 
join in the attack. On July 27 our forces withdrew on their own initiative from Yehtai 
Mountain and forty-one villages west of it. The Kuomintang forces continued their 
attacks on Hsunyi, Yaohsien and other points. On August 8 our forces struck back at 
the invading Kuomintang troops and recovered the Yehtai mountain area. 
13 This slogan was raised by the ³Left² opportunists during the period from 
October 1933 to October 1934 when the Red Army of the Central Base Area was 
repulsing the Kuomintang¹s fifth encirclement campaign. The slogan was diametrically 
opposed to the strategy formulated by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, which was to lure 
the enemy deep into our territory, concentrate a superior force and select the enemy¹s 
weak points in order to wipe him out in mobile warfare. 
14 In January 1941, as demanded by Chiang Kai-shek, the Headquarters of the 
New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party of China and the units under the 
direct command of this headquarters moved north from southern Anhwei Province to 
cross the Yangtse River. While on the march they were encircled and ambushed by 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s troops and lost more than 9,000, killed, wounded and captured. 
Subsequently Chiang Kai-shek announced the cancellation of the designation of the 
New Fourth Army and ordered attacks against its other units. The event was called 
the Southern Anhwei Incident. 
15 During the War of Resistance the Kuomintang kept a staff officer in Yenan for 
liaison. ³Ho² refers to Ho Ying-chin, Chief of the Kuomintang General Staff. On 
October 19 and December 8, 1940, Chiang Kai-shek sent two telegrams in the names of 
Ho Ying-chin and Pai Chung-hsi, Deputy Chief of the Kuomintang General Staff, outrageously 
slandering the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which were 
fighting stubbornly behind the Japanese lines, and arbitrarily ordering the people¹s 
anti-Japanese armed forces operating south of the Yellow River to withdraw north 
of the river within a definite time-limit. The Kuomintang reactionaries then launched 
a sudden attack on units of the New Fourth Army which were moving north and thus 
created the Southern Anhwei Incident. At that time the Communist Party of China 
pointed to Ho Ying-chin as the representative of the Kuomintang reactionaries who

25 SITUATION AND OUR POLICY AFTER VICTORY OVER JAPAN 
had launched the large-scale anti-Communist campaign, but actually Chiang Kai-shek 
was meant. 
16 The ³People¹s Political Council² was an advisory body set up by the Kuomintang 
government after the start of the War of Resistance. Its members were all 
³selected² by the Kuomintang government; the majority belonged to the Kuomintang, 
and only a very few belonged to the Communist Party of China and other political 
parties. Moreover, the Kuomintang government did not recognize the equal and 
legal status of the parties which were opposed to Japanese aggression, nor did it allow 
their members to sit in the ³People¹s Political Council² as representatives of their 
parties. One of the stipulations of the ³Organic Rules of the People¹s Political 
Council² promulgated by the Kuomintang government was that those persons might 
become members of the Council ³who have served in important cultural or economic 
organizations for three years or more and enjoy prestige, or those who devote themselves 
to affairs of state and have long enjoyed prestige². It was on the basis of 
this stipulation that the Kuomintang ³selected² some councillors from the Communist 
Party of China.

written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Hsinhua News Agency, pp. 27-31 of this

20 From July to September 1931 Chiang Kai-shek personally held the post of 
commander-in-chief and moved 300,000 reactionary troops in an encirclement campaign 
against the Kiangsi Red Base Area. The Red Army smashed this encirclement 
campaign and won a great victory. For details, see ³Strategic Problems of the

to Yenan. 
23 The fortified village referred to was Tanpachai in the southwest of Pao-an 
County. There were over two hundred households in the village, which occupied a 
highly strategic position. Tsao Chun-chang, a landlord despot who headed a reactionary 
local armed band of over a hundred men, had long entrenched himself in 
this village. The Chinese Red Army repeatedly besieged the village but failed to 
capture it. In August 1936 the Red Army, while surrounding Tanpachai with the local 
armed forces, proceeded to win over the basic masses in the village and disintegrate 
the enemy from within. In December of the same year the bandit Tsao fled with a 
handful of his men, and Tanpachai was liberated.

Observer Group in Yenan. With the consent of the Communist Party of China, this 
group was sent to Yenan in 1944 by the U.S. forces fighting against Japan. Patrick 
J. Hurley, a reactionary politician of the Republican Party, came to China in September 
1944 as the personal representative of the U.S. president and at the end of the year 
became U.S. ambassador to China. See ³The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the 
Mountains², Note 1, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. III. 
26 The United States dropped an atom bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and 
another on Nagasaki on August 9. The propaganda organs of the United States and 
of the Kuomintang made much of the event, alleging that the Japanese government 
had surrendered because it was afraid of the U.S. atom bombs. By such propaganda 
they hoped to belittle the decisive role played by the entry of the Soviet Union into 
the war in compelling Japan to surrender. 
27 Mountbatten, then Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, 
made a statement on August 9, 1945, welcoming the entry of the Soviet Union into the 
war against Japan. He also said that the worst possible mistake would be to believe 
that the atom bomb could end the war in the Far East.

CHIANG KAI-SHEK IS PROVOKING CIVIL WAR* 
August 13, 1945
A spokesman for the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang 
Central Executive Committee has made a statement describing as ³a 
presumptuous and illegal act² the order1 setting a time-limit for the 
surrender of the enemy and the puppets,2 which was issued by Chu 
Teh, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army, on August 
10 from the General Headquarters in Yenan. This comment is absolutely 
preposterous. Its logical implication is that it was wrong of Commanderin-
Chief Chu Teh to act in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration3 
and with the enemy¹s declared intention of surrendering and to order 
his troops to effect the surrender of the enemy and the puppets, and 
that on the contrary it would have been right and legitimate to advise 
the enemy and puppets to refuse to surrender. No wonder that even 
before the enemy¹s actual surrender, Chiang Kai-shek, China¹s fascist 
ringleader, autocrat and traitor to the people, had the audacity to 
³order² the anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated Areas to 
³stay where they are, pending further orders², that is, to tie their own 
hands and let the enemy attack them. No wonder this selfsame 
fascist ringleader dared to ³order² the so-called underground forces 
(who are, in fact, puppet troops ³saving the nation by a devious path²4 
and Tai Li¹s5 secret police collaborating with the Japanese and puppets) 
as well as other puppet troops to ³be responsible for maintaining local 
order², while forbidding the anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated 
Areas to ³take presumptuous action on their own² against enemy 
and puppet forces. This transposition of the enemy and the Chinese 
is in truth a confession by Chiang Kai-shek; it gives a vivid picture of 
his whole psychology, which is one of consistent collusion with the 
enemy and puppets and of liquidation of all those not of his ilk. 
However, the people¹s anti-Japanese armed forces in China¹s Liberated 
Areas will never be taken in by this venomous scheme. They know 
27

28 MAO TSE-TUNG 
that Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh¹s order is precisely the resolute 
fulfilment of the provision in paragraph 2 of the Potsdam Declaration, 
³prosecute the war against Japan until she ceases to resist². On 
the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek¹s so-called ³orders² are precisely 
violations of the Potsdam Declaration which he himself signed. 
One has only to make the comparison to see at once who is not 
³adhering faithfully to the provisions of the common agreements of 
the Allies². 
Both the comment by the spokesman for the Propaganda Department 
of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s ³orders² are from beginning to end provocations to civil 
war; at this moment, when attention at home and abroad is focussed 
on Japan¹s unconditional surrender, their aim is to find a pretext for 
switching to civil war as soon as the War of Resistance ends. In 
reality, the Kuomintang reactionaries are pitifully stupid. They have 
sought their pretext in Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh¹s order for the 
surrender and disarming of the enemy and puppet troops. Can this 
be considered a clever pretext? No. That they seek a pretext in this 
way proves only that the Kuomintang reactionaries are fonder of the 
enemy and puppets than of their fellow-countrymen and that they hate 
their fellow-countrymen more than they do the enemy and puppets. 
The Chunhua Incident6 was plainly an invasion of the Shensi-Kansu- 
Ningsia Border Region by Hu Tsung-nan¹s troops to provoke civil war, 
and yet the Kuomintang reactionaries said it was a ³rumour offensive² 
by the Communist Party of China. The Kuomintang reactionaries 
found their long-sought-for pretext in the Chunhua Incident, but 
Chinese and foreign public opinion saw through it at once. So now 
they are saying that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army 
should not demand that the enemy and puppet troops surrender their 
guns. In the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Eighth Route 
Army and the New Fourth Army have suffered enough from the 
attacks and encirclements of both Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese. 
And now, with the War of Resistance coming to an end, Chiang Kaishek 
is hinting to the Japanese (and to his beloved puppet troops) that 
they should not surrender their guns to the Eighth Route Army and 
the New Fourth Army but ³only to me, Chiang Kai-shek². One 
thing, however, Chiang Kai-shek has left unsaid, ³. . . so that I can 
use these guns to kill the Communists and wreck the peace of China 
* This was a commentary written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Hsinhua 
News Agency.

29 CHIANG KAI-SHEK IS PROVOKING CIVIL WAR 
and the world.² Isn¹t this the truth? What will be the result of telling 
the Japanese to hand over their guns to Chiang Kai-shek and telling 
the puppet troops to ³be responsible for maintaining local order²? 
The result can only be that a merger of the Nanking and Chungking 
regimes7 and co-operation between Chiang Kai-shek and the puppets 
will take the place of ³Sino-Japanese collaboration² and of co-operation 
between the Japanese and the puppets, and that Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
³anti-communism and national reconstruction² will take the place of 
the ³anti-communism and national reconstruction² of the Japanese and 
Wang Ching-wei.8 Isn¹t this a violation of the Potsdam Declaration? 
Can there be any doubt that the grave danger of civil war will confront 
the people of the whole country the moment the War of Resistance 
is over? We now appeal to all our fellow-countrymen and to the 
Allied countries to take action, together with the people of the Liberated 
Areas, resolutely to prevent a civil war in China, which would endanger 
world peace. 
After all, who has the right to accept the surrender of the Japanese 
and puppets? Relying solely on their own efforts and the support of 
the people, the anti-Japanese armed forces in China¹s Liberated Areas, 
to whom the Kuomintang government refused all supplies and recognition, 
have succeeded by themselves in liberating vast territories and 
more than 100 million people and have resisted and pinned down 
56 per cent of the invading enemy troops in China and 95 per cent of 
the puppet troops. If not for these armed forces, the situation in 
China would never have been what it is today! To speak plainly, in 
China only the anti-Japanese armed forces of the Liberated Areas have 
the right to accept the surrender of the enemy and puppet troops. As 
for Chiang Kai-shek, his policy has been to look on with folded arms 
and sit around and wait for victory; indeed he has no right at all to 
accept the surrender of the enemy and the puppets. 
We declare to all our fellow-countrymen and to the people of the 
whole world: The Supreme Command in Chungking cannot represent 
the Chinese people and those Chinese armed forces which have really 
fought Japan; the Chinese people demand the right of the anti-Japanese 
armed forces of China¹s Liberated Areas under Commander-in-Chief 
Chu Teh to send their representatives directly in order to participate 
in the acceptance of Japan¹s surrender and in the military control over 
Japan by the four Allied Powers and also to participate in the future 
peace conference. If this is not done, the Chinese people will deem 
it most improper.

30 MAO TSE-TUNG 
NOTES 
1 On August 10, 1945, Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh issued an order from the 
General Headquarters in Yenan to all armed forces in the Liberated Areas concerning 
the surrender of the Japanese invaders. The order reads as follows: 
Japan has announced her unconditional surrender, and the Allies will meet 
to discuss measures for accepting the surrender on the basis of the Potsdam 
Declaration. I hereby issue the following order to all our armed forces in the 
Liberated Areas: 
(1) In accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, any 
anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated Areas may serve notice on enemy 
troops and headquarters in cities and towns or along communication lines in the 
vicinity, requiring them to hand over all their arms to our fighting forces within 
a given time; when they have handed over their arms, our forces will protect 
their lives in accordance with our regulations on the lenient treatment of 
prisoners of war. 
(2) Any anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated Areas may serve 
notice on all the puppet troops and puppet government organs in the vicinity, 
requiring them to come over with their troops to our side before the signing of 
the surrender by the Japanese invaders and to wait for reorganization and 
disbandment; those who fail to comply within the time allowed shall hand over 
all their arms. 
(3) All anti-Japanese armed forces in the Liberated Areas should resolutely 
wipe out all those enemy and puppet armed forces which refuse to surrender 
and hand over their arms. 
(4) Our armed forces have full authority to send their units to take over 
and occupy any city, town or communication line held by the enemy and the 
puppets, to set up military control, to maintain order and to appoint commissioners 
to take charge of all administrative matters there; in case of any act of sabotage 
or resistance, the culprits shall be punished as traitors. 
Then, on August 11 the General Headquarters in Yenan issued six successive orders, 
under which the armed forces of the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area (led by Comrade 
Ho Lung), the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area (led by Comrade Nieh Jung-chen) 
and the Hopei-Jehol-Liaoning Liberated Area were to march on Inner Mongolia and 
the Northeast; the armed forces of the Shansi Liberated Area were to mop up the 
Japanese and puppet troops along the Tatung-Puchow Railway and in the Fenho River 
valley; and the armed forces of all the Liberated Areas were to launch vigorous 
offensives on all the main communication lines under enemy control to compel the 
Japanese and puppet troops to surrender. The units of the People¹s Liberation Army in 
all the Liberated Areas resolutely carried out these orders and won important victories. 
2 Here ³enemy² refers to the Japanese invading forces, and ³puppets² refers to 
the puppet governments set up by the Japanese invaders and to the troops of these 
puppet governments, consisting largely of former Kuomintang officials and of troops 
who had surrendered to Japan. 
3 This refers to the declaration made by China, Britain and the United States at 
the Potsdam conference on July 26, 1945, requiring Japan to surrender. The main 
points of the declaration were that Japanese militarism must be eliminated for good 
and all; Japan¹s military forces must be completely disarmed; Japan¹s war industries 
must be dismantled; Japanese war criminals must be tried; the Cairo Declaration 
must be carried out, that is, Japan must renounce the territories she had stolen, such

31 CHIANG KAI-SHEK IS PROVOKING CIVIL WAR 
as Korea and China¹s Manchuria, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and Japan¹s 
territory must be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and 
various minor islands; and that the armed forces of the Allies were to occupy Japan 
until the establishment of a democratic Japanese government. The Soviet Union 
also signed the Potsdam Declaration after it declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945. 
4 This refers to the dastardly practice of capitulating to Japan and fighting communism 
followed by the Kuomintang reactionaries during the War of Resistance 
Against Japan. The Kuomintang reactionaries directed part of their troops and 
government officials to surrender to the Japanese invaders and then, as puppet troops 
and officials, to join the Japanese troops in attacking the Liberated Areas, this was 
what they cunningly named ³saving the nation by a devious path².

Military Council of the Kuomintang, one of the Kuomintang¹s huge secret service 
agencies.

Kuanchung sub-region of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region in July 1945. See 
³The Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against 
Japan², Note 12, p. 24 of this volume. 
7 Wang Ching-wei¹s puppet regime was in Nanking and Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
regime was in Chungking. The ³merger of the Nanking and Chungking regimes² 
was a political plot hatched by Japanese imperialism and the pro-Japanese elements 
within the Kuomintang. 
8 Wang Ching-wei was a notorious Kuomintang leader and pro-Japanese traitor. 
He openly surrendered to the Japanese invaders in December 1938 when he was 
vice-chairman of the Kuomintang and chairman of its People¹s Political Council. 
In March 1940 he became president of the puppet central government then formed 
in Nanking. He died in Japan in November 1944.


TWO TELEGRAMS 
FROM THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF 
THE EIGHTEENTH GROUP ARMY 
TO CHIANG KAI-SHEK* 
August 1945
I. TELEGRAM OF AUGUST 13 
We have received through the Chungking radio two Central News 
Agency dispatches, one carrying the order you sent us and the other 
your order to the officers and men in various war zones. Your order 
to us reads, ³All units of the Eighteenth Group Army should stay 
where they are, pending further orders.² In addition, it talks about 
such things as forbidding us to take over the enemy¹s arms. Your order 
to the officers and men in various war zones was reported as follows 
in the Central News Agency dispatch from Chungking, dated August 
11: ³The Supreme Command today sent telegrams to the officers and 
men in various war zones, ordering them to step up the war effort and 
in accordance with existing military plans and orders actively to push 
forward without the slightest relaxation.² We hold that these two 
orders contradict each other. According to the first, our units should 
³stay where they are, pending further orders² and should no longer 
attack or fight. Why do you tell us not to fight at this moment when the 
Japanese aggressors have not yet actually surrendered, when every 
hour and every minute they are killing Chinese people and fighting 
Chinese troops as well as Soviet, U.S. and British troops, and when, 
in their turn, the Soviet, U.S. and British troops are fighting the Japanese 
aggressors every hour and every minute? As to the second order, we 
consider it very good. ³Step up the war effort and actively push forward 
without the slightest relaxation² ‹ that¹s more like it! But what 
a pity you have given this order only to your own troops, and not to us, 
33

34 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and that you have given us something quite different. Chu Teh issued 
an order on August 10 to all anti-Japanese armed forces in China¹s 
Liberated Areas1 precisely to the effect that they should ³step up the 
war effort². His order said further that while stepping up their war 
effort they must order the Japanese aggressors to surrender to them 
and must take over the arms and other equipment of the enemy and 
puppet troops. Isn¹t this very good? Undoubtedly it is very good; 
undoubtedly it is in the interest of the Chinese nation. But to ³stay 
where they are, pending further orders² is definitely not in the national 
interest. We hold that you have given a wrong order, an order so 
wrong that we have to inform you we firmly reject it. For your order 
to us is not only unjust but also runs counter to China¹s national interest 
and benefits only the Japanese aggressors and the traitors to the 
motherland. 
II. TELEGRAM OF AUGUST 16 
At a time when our common enemy, the Japanese government, has 
accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and already announced 
its surrender but has not yet actually surrendered, I hereby address 
to you the following statement and demands on behalf of all the anti- 
Japanese armed forces and all the 260 million people in China¹s 
Liberated Areas and Japanese-occupied areas. 
* These telegrams were written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Commanderin-
Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army. At that time, when the Japanese aggressors 
had announced their surrender but had not yet actually surrendered, the Chiang 
Kai-shek government, with the armed assistance of U.S. imperialism, monopolized 
the right to accept the Japanese surrender and was actively preparing a counterrevolutionary 
civil war by sending large forces to advance on the Liberated Areas 
on the pretext of accepting the Japanese surrender. Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s purpose 
in writing the first telegram was to unmask the counter-revolutionary face of Chiang 
Kai-shek and teach the whole people to be on guard against his civil war plot. The 
second telegram further exposed the plot of the Chiang Kai-shek clique for preparing 
civil war and put forward the six-point proposal of the Communist Party of China 
for preventing civil war. For the same purpose, Comrade Mao Tse-tung wrote for 
the Hsinhua News Agency two commentaries, ³Chiang Kai-shek Is Provoking Civil 
War² and ³On a Statement by Chiang Kai-shek¹s Spokesman², which are included 
in this volume. Owing to the firm, determined stand of the Communist Party of 
China in refusing to be cowed by Chiang Kai-shek¹s reactionary bluster, both the 
Liberated Areas and the Liberation Army expanded quickly; and, under strong political 
pressure from the forces at home and abroad opposed to civil war in China, Chiang 
Kai-shek had to change his tactics, assume a posture of peace and invite Comrade 
Mao Tse-tung to Chungking for peace negotiations.

35 TWO TELEGRAMS TO CHIANG KAI-SHEK 
With the War of Resistance Against Japan coming to a victorious 
close, I call your attention to this fact in the China war theatre today, 
namely, that in the vast occupied areas abandoned by you and seized 
by the enemy and puppets we have, against your will, by our eight 
years of bitter fighting recaptured nearly 1,000,000 square kilometres 
of territory; liberated over 100,000,000 people; organized over 
1,000,000 regular troops and over 2,200,000 people¹s militia; established 
nineteen large Liberated Areas in the nineteen provinces of 
Liaoning, Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hopei, Shansi, Shensi, Kansu, 
Ningsia, Honan, Shantung, Kiangsu, Anhwei, Hupeh, Hunan, Kiangsi, 
Chekiang, Fukien and Kwangtung;2 and encircled most of the cities 
and towns, vital communication lines and sections of the sea coast 
seized by the enemy and puppets since the July 7th Incident of 1937,3 
except in a few areas. In addition, in China¹s Japanese-occupied 
areas (with a population of 160 million) we have organized extensive 
underground forces to strike at the enemy and puppets. In the fighting 
we are continuing to resist and encircle 69 per cent of the Japanese 
troops invading China (not counting those in the Northeast) and 95 
per cent of the puppet troops. Your government and armed forces, 
on the contrary, have all along followed a policy of looking on with 
folded arms, sitting around and waiting for victory, conserving your 
forces and preparing for civil war, and have not only refused recognition 
and supplies to our Liberated Areas and armies but encircled 
and attacked us with a huge force of 940,000 men. Although all 
the troops and civilians in China¹s Liberated Areas have suffered 
enough from being attacked by the enemy and puppet forces on the 
one side and by your troops on the other, we have never in the least 
weakened in our determination to persevere in the War of Resistance, 
in unity and in democracy. The people of China¹s Liberated Areas 
and the Communist Party of China have proposed many times to you 
and your government that a conference of all parties be convened and 
that a democratic coalition government of the whole country be formed 
in order to stop internal strife, mobilize and unite the people¹s anti- 
Japanese forces throughout China, lead the War of Resistance to victory 
and ensure peace after the war. But our proposals have invariably 
been rejected by you and your government. We are extremely dissatisfied 
with all this. 
The enemy country will soon sign its surrender, but you and your 
government have continued to ignore our opinions, issued a most 
outrageous order to me on August 11 and ordered your troops to press

36 MAO TSE-TUNG 
against the Liberated Areas on a large scale under the pretext of disarming 
the enemy; the danger of civil war is therefore more serious 
than ever. All of which compels us to make the following demands 
on you and your government: 
1. I demand that you consult with us, so that we may reach common 
views before you, your government and your Supreme Command 
accept the surrender of the Japanese and the puppets and conclude any 
post-surrender agreements or treaties. For you and your government 
have aroused the dissatisfaction of the people and cannot represent the 
broad masses or any of the people¹s anti-Japanese armed forces in 
China¹s Liberated Areas and Japanese-occupied areas. We reserve our 
right to speak out, if the agreements or treaties include, without our 
prior consent, anything that concerns the people¹s anti-Japanese armed 
forces in China¹s Liberated Areas and Japanese-occupied areas. 
2. All the people¹s anti-Japanese armed forces in China¹s Liberated 
Areas and Japanese-occupied areas have the right, in accordance 
with the Potsdam Declaration and the measures laid down by the 
Allies for accepting the enemy surrender,4 to accept the surrender of 
the Japanese and puppet troops encircled by us, take over their arms 
and materiel and assume the responsibility for carrying out all stipulations 
laid down by the Allies after Japan¹s surrender has been accepted. 
On August 10 I ordered the armed forces of China¹s Liberated 
Areas to make all efforts to attack the enemy troops and be prepared 
to accept their surrender. On August 15, I ordered the enemy 
commander-in-chief, Yasuji Okamura, to surrender with his troops;5 
this order, however, applies only to the sphere of operations of the 
armed forces of the Liberated Areas, and not to any other. I consider 
my orders very reasonable and very much in the common interest of 
China and the Allies. 
3. The broad masses and all the anti-Japanese armed forces in 
China¹s Liberated Areas and Japanese-occupied areas have the right 
to send their representatives to participate in the Allies¹ acceptance 
of the enemy surrender and in the work of dealing with the enemy 
country after its surrender. 
4. China¹s Liberated Areas and all the anti-Japanese armed forces 
have the right to select their own delegation to participate in the future 
peace conference concerned with Japan and any United Nations 
meetings. 
5. I ask you to prevent civil war. The way to do this is for the 
armed forces of the Liberated Areas to accept the surrender of the

37 TWO TELEGRAMS TO CHIANG KAI-SHEK 
enemy and puppet troops they have encircled, while your armed forces 
accept the surrender of the enemy and puppet troops you have encircled. 
Not only is this the established practice in all wars, it is particularly 
imperative in order to avert civil war. If you act otherwise, it will 
lead to adverse consequences. I am now giving you a serious warning 
on this matter and I ask you not to treat this warning casually. 
6. I ask you immediately to abolish the one-party dictatorship, 
call a conference of all parties to set up a democratic coalition government, 
dismiss corrupt officials and all reactionaries from their posts, 
punish the traitors, abolish the secret services, recognize the legal status 
of the various parties (the Communist Party of China and all democratic 
parties have up to now been regarded as illegal by you and your 
government), annul all reactionary laws and decrees that suppress the 
liberties of the people, recognize the popularly elected governments 
and the anti-Japanese armed forces of China¹s Liberated Areas, withdraw 
the troops encircling the Liberated Areas, release political 
prisoners and carry out economic and other democratic reforms. 
Apart from this, I sent you a telegram on August 13 in reply to your 
order to me of August 11, and presumably you have received it. I now 
declare again, your order was completely wrong. On August 11 you 
ordered my troops to ³stay where they are, pending further orders² and 
not to attack the enemy any more. However, not only was it true on 
August 11, but it is equally true even today (August 16) that the Japanese 
government has surrendered only in words, and not in deeds; no instrument 
of surrender has been signed, no actual surrender has taken place. 
My view is completely in accord with that of the Allies, Britain, the 
United States and the Soviet Union. On August 11, the very day you 
issued your order to me, the British Army Command on the Burma 
front announced that the war with Japan was still in progress. Nimitz,6 
the commander of the U.S. forces, declared that not only did a state of 
war continue but the war with all its devastating consequences must 
be carried on. The Far Eastern Command of the Red Army of the 
Soviet Union announced, ³The enemy must be ruthlessly smashed.² 
On August 15, Colonel-General Antonov, Chief of the General Staff 
of the Red Army, made the following statement: 
The message concerning Japan¹s surrender issued by the Japanese 
Emperor on August 14 is only a general declaration concerning 
unconditional surrender. The order to the armed forces to cease 
hostilities has not yet been issued and the Japanese troops are

38 MAO TSE-TUNG 
continuing their resistance. Hence there is still no actual surrender 
by the armed forces of Japan. The surrender of the armed forces 
of Japan can be considered to have taken place only from the 
moment the Japanese Emperor orders his armed forces to discontinue 
hostilities and lay down their arms and when this order 
is carried out in practice. In view of the above, the armed forces 
of the Soviet Union in the Far East will continue their offensive 
operations against Japan. 
It can be seen that you alone, of all the high commanders of the Allied 
forces, have given an absolutely wrong order. I consider that your 
error stems from your self-seeking and is of an extremely serious 
nature; that is to say, your order serves the interest of the enemy. 
Therefore, taking my stand on the common interest of China and the 
Allies, I shall firmly and completely oppose your order so long as you 
do not openly admit your error and countermand this wrong order. 
At present I am still ordering the armed units under my command to 
make determined attacks on the enemy, in co-ordination with the 
armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, until 
the enemy actually stops hostilities and surrenders his arms and all 
the territory of the motherland has been fully recovered. I declare to 
you, I am a patriotic soldier, I cannot act otherwise. 
With regard to the above I request your early reply.

Lukouchiao, ten kilometres southwest of Peking. Under the influence of the ardent 
anti-Japanese movement of the whole people, the Chinese troops there put up resistance. 
This incident marked the beginning of the Chinese people¹s heroic War of Resistance 
Against Japan which lasted for eight years. 
4 On August 10, 1945, the Japanese government notified the Soviet Union, China, 
the United States and Britain of its desire to surrender. On August 11 the governments 
of the four countries replied that ³all the Japanese military, naval and air 
authorities² and ³all the forces under their control wherever located² must ³cease 
active operations² and ³surrender their arms².

5 Yasuji Okamura was then commander-in-chief of the Japanese invading forces 
in China. The order from Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh to Yasuji Okamura reads 
as follows: 
(1) The Japanese government has formally accepted the terms of the 
Potsdam Declaration and announced its surrender. 
(2) You are to order all the troops under your command to cease all military 
operations; all of them, except those encircled by the troops of the Kuomintang 
government, must surrender to us upon orders from the Eighth Route Army, 
New Fourth Army and Southern China Anti-Japanese Column of China¹s 
Liberated Areas. 
(3) With regard to the surrender of the Japanese troops in northern China, 
you are to order General Sadamu Shimomura to appoint a representative to go 
to the Eighth Route Army¹s Fuping area to receive orders from General Nieh 
Jung-chen; with regard to the surrender of the Japanese troops in eastern China, 
you yourself are to appoint a representative to go to the Tienchang area, where 
the Headquarters of the New Fourth Army is located, to receive orders from 
General Chen Yi; with regard to the surrender of the Japanese troops in Hupeh 
and Honan Provinces, you are to order your representative in Wuhan to go to 
the Tapieh mountain area of the 5th Division of the New Fourth Army to receive 
orders from General Li Hsien-nien; with regard to the surrender of the 
Japanese troops in Kwangtung, you are to instruct your representative in Canton 
to go to the Tungkuan area of the Southern China Anti-Japanese Column to 
receive orders from General Tseng Sheng. 
(4) All the Japanese troops in northern, eastern, central and southern China 
(except those encircled by the Kuomintang troops) must keep all arms and 
materiel intact, pending our army¹s acceptance of their surrender, and must not 
take orders except from the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army or 
the Southern China Anti-Japanese Column. 
(5) All the aircraft and vessels in northern and eastern China are to 
stay where they are, but the vessels anchored along the Chinese coast of the 
Yellow Sea and the Pohai Gulf should be assembled at Lienyunkang, Tsingtao, 
Weihaiwei and Tientsin. 
(6) There must be no destruction of any materiel or installations. 
(7) You and the commanders of the Japanese army in northern, eastern, 
central and southern China will be held completely responsible for the execution 
of this order.

ON A STATEMENT 
BY CHIANG KAI-SHEK¹S SPOKESMAN* 
August 16, 1945
A spokesman for Chiang Kai-shek, commenting on the alleged 
violation by the Communist Party of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
order to Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh, said at a press conference in 
Chungking on the afternoon of August 15, ³The orders of the generalissimo 
must be obeyed² and ³Those who violate them are enemies 
of the people.² A Hsinhua News Agency correspondent states: This 
is an open signal by Chiang Kai-shek for all-out civil war. On August 
11, at the critical moment when the Japanese invaders were being 
finally wiped out, Chiang Kai-shek issued an order of national betrayal 
forbidding the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army and all 
the other armed forces of the people to fight the Japanese and the 
puppet troops. Of course, this order absolutely cannot and should not 
be accepted. Soon afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek through his spokesman 
proclaimed the armed forces of the Chinese people to be ³enemies of 
the people². This shows that Chiang Kai-shek has declared civil war 
against the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek¹s plotting of civil war 
did not of course begin with his order of August 11; it has been his 
consistent plan throughout the eight years of the War of Resistance. 
During those eight years, Chiang Kai-shek launched three large-scale 
anti-Communist campaigns, in 1940, 1941 and 1943,1 each time attempting 
to develop the attack into a country-wide civil war, and only the 
opposition of the Chinese people and of public figures in the Allied 
countries prevented its occurrence, much to Chiang¹s regret. Thus he 
was forced to postpone the country-wide civil war until the end of 
the War of Resistance Against Japan, and so came the order of August 
11 and the statement of August 15. For the purpose of unleashing 
civil war, Chiang Kai-shek had already invented many terms, such as 
³alien party², ³traitor party², ³traitor army², ³rebel army², ³traitor 
41

42 MAO TSE-TUNG 
areas², ³bandit areas², ³disobedience to military and government 
orders², ³feudal separatism², ³undermining the War of Resistance² 
and ³endangering the state²; and he had alleged that, since in the past 
there had been only ³suppression of Communists² in China and not 
³civil war², there would be no ³civil war² in the future either, and 
so on and so forth. The slight difference this time is the addition of 
a new term, ³enemy of the people². But people will perceive that this 
is a foolish invention. For whenever the term, ³enemy of the people², 
is used in China, everyone knows who is meant. There is a person 
in China who betrayed Sun Yat-sen¹s Three People¹s Principles2 and 
the Great Revolution of 1927. He plunged the Chinese people into 
the bloodbath of ten years of civil war and thereby invited aggression 
by Japanese imperialism. Then, scared out of his wits, he took to 
his heels and led a flock of people in a flight all the way from Heilungkiang 
to Kweichow Province. He became an onlooker and sat around, 
waiting with folded arms for victory to come. Now that victory has 
come, he tells the people¹s armies to ³stay where they are, pending 
further orders² and tells the enemy and the traitors to ³maintain 
order² so that he can swagger back to Nanking. One need only mention 
these facts for the Chinese people to know that this person is Chiang 
Kai-shek. After all he has done, can there be any dispute as to 
whether Chiang Kai-shek is an enemy of the people? Dispute there 
is. The people say ³Yes². The enemy of the people says ³No². And 
that is the only dispute. Among the people it is becoming less and 
less a matter of dispute. The problem now is that this enemy of the 
people wants to start a civil war. What are the people to do? The 
Hsinhua News Agency correspondent says: The policy of the Communist 
Party of China in regard to Chiang Kai-shek¹s launching a civil 
war is clear and consistent, namely, to oppose it. As far back as the 
time when Japanese imperialism began to invade China, the Communist 
Party of China demanded an end to civil war and unity against 
foreign aggression. In 1936-37 the Party made tremendous efforts, 
forced Chiang Kai-shek to accept its proposal and so carried out 
the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the eight years of 
resistance, the Communist Party of China never once relaxed its 
efforts to alert the people to check the danger of civil war. Since last 
year, the Communist Party has time and again called the people¹s 
attention to the huge plot being hatched by Chiang Kai-shek to unleash 
* This commentary was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Hsinhua 
News Agency.

43 ON STATEMENT BY CHIANG KAI-SHEK¹S SPOKESMAN 
a country-wide civil war as soon as the War of Resistance ended. The 
Communist Party, like the rest of the Chinese people and all the people 
in the world concerned for peace in China, holds that a new civil war 
would be a calamity. But the Communist Party maintains that civil 
war can still be prevented and must be prevented. It is in order to 
prevent civil war that the Communist Party has advocated the formation 
of a coalition government. Now Chiang Kai-shek has rejected 
this proposal, and so civil war is touch-and-go. But there is definitely 
a way of checking this move of Chiang Kai-shek¹s. The people¹s democratic 
forces must strive to expand resolutely and rapidly; the people 
must liberate the big cities under enemy occupation and disarm the 
enemy and puppet troops; and if an autocrat and traitor to the people 
dares to attack them, the people must act in self-defence and resolutely 
strike back to frustrate the designs of the instigator of civil war. That 
is the way, the only way. The Hsinhua News Agency correspondent 
calls on the whole nation and the whole world to repudiate the utterly 
hypocritical and shameless lie which asserts that, on the contrary, civil 
war in China can be averted if Chiang Kai-shek forbids the Chinese 
people to liberate the enemy-occupied big cities, forbids them to disarm 
enemy and puppet forces and forbids them to establish democracy, and 
if he himself goes to these big cities to ³inherit² (not to smash) the 
enemy and puppet regimes. This is a lie, the Hsinhua News Agency 
correspondent points out, and this lie obviously runs counter to the 
national and democratic interests of the Chinese people and also flies 
in the face of all the facts of modern Chinese history. It must always be 
remembered that it was not because the big cities were in the hands of 
the Communist Party rather than in his own hands that Chiang Kaishek 
waged the ten-year civil war from 1927 to 1937; on the contrary, 
since 1927 none of the big cities has been in the hands of the Communist 
Party but all have been in Chiang¹s hands or have been yielded by him 
to the Japanese and the traitors, and this is the very reason why the civil 
war lasted for ten years on a country-wide scale and has continued 
on a local scale to this day. It must always be remembered that 
the ten-year civil war was stopped and that the three large-scale anti- 
Communist campaigns and countless other provocations during the 
War of Resistance were checked (up to and including Chiang Kaishek¹s 
recent invasion of the southern part of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia 
Border Region3), not because Chiang Kai-shek was strong, but on the 
contrary because Chiang was relatively not strong enough, while the 
Communist Party and the people were relatively strong. The ten

year civil war was stopped, not by the appeals of public figures throughout 
the country who desired peace and feared war (such as those of 
the former ³League for Banning Civil War²4 and similar bodies), but 
by the armed demand of the Communist Party of China and the 
armed demands of the Northeastern Army under Chang Hsueh-liang 
and the Northwestern Army under Yang Hu-cheng.5 The three largescale 
anti-Communist campaigns and countless other provocations were 
not beaten back by unlimited concessions and submission by the 
Communist Party; they were beaten back by the Communist Party¹s 
persistence in a just, stern attitude of self-defence ‹ ³We will not 
attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly 
counter-attack.²6 If the Communist Party had been utterly powerless 
and spineless and had not fought to the finish for the interests of 
the nation and the people, how could the ten-year civil war have been 
ended? How could the War of Resistance Against Japan have started? 
And even though started, how could it have been carried on resolutely 
until victory today? How else could Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk be 
alive now, issuing orders and making statements from a mountain 
retreat so far from the front lines? The Communist Party of China 
is firmly opposed to civil war. The Soviet Union, the United States 
and Britain declared in the Crimea, ³establish conditions of internal 
peace² and ³form interim governmental authorities broadly representative 
of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the 
earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments 
responsive to the will of the people².7 That is exactly what the Communist 
Party of China has persistently advocated ‹ the formation of 
a ³coalition government². The carrying out of this proposal can prevent 
civil war. But there is one precondition ‹ strength. If all the 
people unite and increase their strength, civil war can be prevented.

by Sun Yat-sen on the questions of nationalism, democracy and people¹s livelihood 
in the bourgeois democratic revolution in China. In 1924, in the Manifesto of the 
First National Congress of the Kuomintang, a congress characterized by co-operation

45 ON STATEMENT BY CHIANG KAI-SHEK¹S SPOKESMAN 
between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, Sun Yat-sen restated the Three 
People¹s Principles, interpreted nationalism as opposition to imperialism and expressed 
active support for the movements of the workers and peasants. The old Three 
People¹s Principles thus developed into the new Three People¹s Principles with the 
Three Great Policies, that is, alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist 
Party and assistance to the peasants and workers. The new Three People¹s 
Principles provided the political basis for the co-operation between the Communist 
Party of China and the Kuomintang during the First Revolutionary Civil War period.

and Yaohsien in the Kuanchung sub-region of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region. See ³The Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of 
Resistance Against Japan², Note 12, p. 24 of this volume.

with a mainly bourgeois membership. It issued a declaration calling for ³ending 
the civil war and uniting to resist foreign aggression². 
5 In 1936 the Kuomintang¹s Northeastern Army headed by Chang Hsueh-liang 
and the Kuomintang¹s Northwestern Army headed by Yang Hu-cheng were stationed 
in and around Sian; they were charged with the task of attacking the Chinese Red 
Army which had arrived in northern Shensi. Influenced by the Chinese Red Army 
and the people¹s anti-Japanese movement, they agreed to the Anti-Japanese National 
United Front put forward by the Communist Party of China and demanded that 
Chiang Kai-shek unite with the Communist Party to resist Japan. Chiang Kai-shek 
turned down the demand, became even more active in his military preparations for 
the ³suppression of the Communists² and massacred the anti-Japanese youth of Sian. 
Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng took joint action and arrested Chiang Kaishek. 
This was the famous Sian Incident of December 12, 1936. Chiang Kai-shek 
was forced to accept the terms of unity with the Communist Party and resistance to 
Japan and was then set free to return to Nanking.

ON PEACE NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE KUOMINTANG 
‹ CIRCULAR OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA* 
August 26, 1945
The speedy surrender of the Japanese invaders has changed the 
whole situation. Chiang Kai-shek has monopolized the right to 
accept the surrender, and for the time being (for a stage) the big 
cities and important lines of communication will not be in our hands. 
Nevertheless, in northern China we should still fight hard, fight with 
all our might to take all we can. In the past two weeks our army 
has recovered fifty-nine cities of various sizes and vast rural areas, 
and including those already in our hands we now control 175 cities, 
thus winning a great victory. In northern China, we have recovered 
Weihaiwei, Yentai, Lungkou, Itu, Tsechuan, Yangliuching, Pikechi, 
Po-ai, Changchiakou, Chining and Fengchen. The might of our army 
has shaken northern China and, together with the sweeping advance 
of the Soviet and Mongolian forces to the Great Wall, has created 
a favourable position for our Party. In the coming period we should 
continue the offensive and do our best to capture the Peiping-Suiyuan 
Railway, the northern section of the Tatung-Puchow Railway and 
the Chengting-Taiyuan, Tehchow-Shihchiachuang, Paikuei-Chincheng 
and Taokou-Chinghua Railways; and also to cut up the Peiping- 
Liaoning, Peiping-Hankow, Tientsin-Pukow, Tsingtao-Tsinan, Lunghai 
and Shanghai-Nanking Railways. We should gain control of whatever 
we can, even though temporarily. At the same time, the necessary 
forces should be employed to take as many villages, county 
and higher administrative centres and small towns as possible. For 
example, a highly favourable situation has been created because the 
New Fourth Army has occupied many county towns lying between 
Nanking, Taihu Lake and the Tienmu Mountains and between the 
47

48 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Yangtse and the Huai Rivers, because our forces in Shantung have 
occupied the whole of the Eastern Shantung Peninsula and because 
our forces in the Shansi-Suiyuan Border Region have occupied many 
cities and towns north and south of the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway. 
After another period of offensive operations, it will be possible 
for our Party to control most of the areas north of the lower Yangtse 
River and the Huai River, most of Shantung, Hopei, Shansi and 
Suiyuan Provinces, all of Jehol and Chahar Provinces and a part of 
Liaoning Province. 
At present the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain all 
disapprove of civil war in China;1 at the same time our Party has 
put forward the three great slogans of peace, democracy and unity2 
and is sending Comrades Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai and Wang 
Jo-fei to Chungking to discuss with Chiang Kai-shek the great issues 
of unity and national reconstruction; thus it is possible that the civil 
war plot of the Chinese reactionaries may be frustrated. The Kuomintang 
has now strengthened its position by recovering Shanghai, 
Nanking and other places, reopening sea communications, taking 
over the arms of the enemy and incorporating the puppet troops into 
its own forces. Nevertheless, it is riddled with a thousand gaping 
wounds, torn by innumerable inner contradictions and beset with 
great difficulties. It is possible that after the negotiations the Kuomintang, 
under domestic and foreign pressure, may conditionally recognize 
our Party¹s status. Our Party too may conditionally recognize the status 
of the Kuomintang. This would bring about a new stage of cooperation 
between the two parties (plus the Democratic League,3 
etc.) and of peaceful development. In that event, our Party should 
* This inner-Party circular was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China two days before he went to Chungking 
for peace negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek. Because the Chinese Communist 
Party and the broad masses of the Chinese people firmly opposed Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
civil war plot and because U.S. imperialism still had to pay some heed to world-wide 
democratic public opinion, which unanimously condemned his policy of civil war and 
dictatorship, Chiang sent three telegrams to Comrade Mao Tse-tung on August 14, 20 
and 23, 1945, inviting him to Chungking for peace negotiations, and for the same 
purpose Patrick J. Hurley, then U.S. ambassador to China, came to Yenan on 
August 27. The Communist Party of China decided to send Comrades Mao Tse-tung, 
Chou En-lai and Wang Jo-fei to Chungking for peace negotiations with the 
Kuomintang in order to make every possible effort for peace and also, in the process of 
struggling for peace, to show U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek in their true colours 
and so help unite and educate the masses of the people. This circular drafted by 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung analysed developments in China during the fortnight after 
Japan announced her surrender. It set forth the policy of the Central Committee of

49 ON PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH KUOMINTANG 
strive to master all methods of legal struggle and intensify its work 
in the Kuomintang areas in the three main spheres, the cities, the 
villages and the army (all weak points in our work there). During 
the negotiations, the Kuomintang is sure to demand that we drastically 
reduce the size of the Liberated Areas, cut down the strength of the 
Liberation Army and stop issuing currency. We on our side are 
prepared to make such concessions as are necessary and as do not 
damage the fundamental interests of the people. Without such concessions, 
we cannot explode the Kuomintang¹s civil war plot, cannot 
gain the political initiative, cannot win the sympathy of world public 
opinion and the middle-of-the-roaders within the country and cannot 
obtain in exchange legal status for our Party and a state of peace. 
But there are limits to such concessions; the principle is that they 
must not damage the fundamental interests of the people. 
If the Kuomintang still wants to launch civil war after our Party 
has taken the above steps, it will put itself in the wrong in the eyes 
of the whole nation and the whole world, and our Party will be justified 
in waging a war of self-defence to crush its attacks. Moreover, 
our Party is powerful, and if anyone attacks us and if the conditions 
are favourable for battle, we will certainly act in self-defence to 
wipe him out resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely (we do 
not strike rashly, but when we do strike, we must win). We must never 
be cowed by the bluster of reactionaries. But we must at all times 
firmly adhere to, and never forget, these principles: unity, struggle, unity 
through struggle; to wage struggles with good reason, with advantage 
and with restraint; and to make use of contradictions, win over the 
many, oppose the few and crush our enemies one by one.4 
the Communist Party of China on the peace negotiations, certain concessions the Party 
was prepared to make in the negotiations and policies for coping with the two possible 
outcomes of the negotiations. It contained directives concerning the principles to be 
followed in the struggles in the Liberated Areas of northern and eastern China and of 
central and southern China respectively. And it warned the whole Party that it must 
absolutely not relax its vigilance or its struggle against Chiang Kai-shek because 
negotiations were to take place. Comrade Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues arrived in 
Chungking on August 28 and held negotiations with the Kuomintang for forty-three 
days. Although the negotiations resulted only in the publication of the ³Summary 
of Conversations Between the Representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist 
Party of China² (also known as the ³October 10th Agreement²), they were nevertheless 
successful in that politically they enabled the Chinese Communist Party to 
gain the initiative to a great extent and put the Kuomintang in a passive position. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung returned to Yenan on October 11. Comrades Chou En-lai 
and Wang Jo-fei remained in Chungking to continue the negotiations. For the results 
see ³On the Chungking Negotiations², the next article in this volume.

50 MAO TSE-TUNG 
In Kwangtung, Hunan, Hupeh, Honan and some other provinces 
our Party forces are in a more difficult position than in northern 
China and the area between the Yangtse and the Huai Rivers. The 
comrades in those places are much in the thoughts of the Central 
Committee. But the Kuomintang has many weak spots and its areas 
are vast; our comrades will be fully able to deal with the situation, 
provided they make no big mistakes in military policy (movements 
and operations) and in the policy of uniting with the people, and provided 
they are modest and prudent, not conceited or rash. Besides 
receiving the necessary directives from the Central Committee, the 
comrades in these areas must use their own judgement to analyse the 
situation, solve their problems, surmount difficulties, maintain themselves 
and expand their forces. When the Kuomintang becomes unable 
to do anything with you, it may be compelled in the negotiations 
between the two parties to give your forces recognition and agree to 
arrangements advantageous to both sides. But you must definitely not 
rely on the negotiations, must definitely not hope that the Kuomintang 
will be kind-hearted, because it will never be kind-hearted. You must 
rely on your own strength, on correct guidance of activities, on 
brotherly unity within the Party and good relations with the people. 
Firmly rely on the people, that is your way out. 
To sum up, our Party is confronted with many difficulties which 
must not be ignored, and all Party comrades must be well prepared 
mentally. But the general trend of the international and internal 
situation is favourable to our Party and to the people. So long as 
the whole Party is united as one, we shall be able to overcome all 
difficulties step by step. 
NOTES 
1 Around the time of Japan¹s surrender, the Soviet Union, the United States and 
Britain for a period all expressed disapproval of civil war in China. Events soon 
demonstrated, however, that the U.S. statement about its so-called disapproval of 
civil war in China was only a screen for actively helping the reactionary Kuomintang 
government prepare for a counter-revolutionary civil war. 
2 The three great slogans of peace, democracy and unity were put forward in the 
³Declaration on the Current Situation² by the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China on August 25, 1945. The declaration pointed out that after the surrender 
of Japanese imperialism, ³the important task confronting the whole nation is to consolidate 
unity in the country, safeguard domestic peace, bring about democracy and

achieve national unification and build a new China, independent, free, prosperous 
and powerful².

Federation of Democratic Political Groups. It was reorganized under the name

ON THE CHUNGKING NEGOTIATIONS* 
October 17, 1945 
Let us talk about the present situation. That is what our comrades 
are interested in. This time the negotiations between the 
Kuomintang and the Communist Party at Chungking have lasted 
forty-three days. The results have already been published in the 
newspapers.1 The representatives of the two parties are continuing 
to negotiate. The negotiations have borne fruit. The Kuomintang 
has accepted the principles of peace and unity, recognized certain 
democratic rights of the people and agreed that civil war should be 
averted and that the two parties should co-operate in peace to build 
a new China. On these points agreement has been reached. There 
are other points on which there is no agreement. The question of 
the Liberated Areas has not been solved, and that of the armed forces 
has not really been solved either. The agreements reached are still 
only on paper. Words on paper are not equivalent to reality. Facts 
have shown that a very great effort must still be made before they 
can be turned into reality. 
The Kuomintang is negotiating with us on the one hand, and is 
vigorously attacking the Liberated Areas on the other hand. Not 
counting the forces surrounding the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region, 800,000 Kuomintang troops are already directly engaged in 
these attacks. Wherever there are Liberated Areas, fighting is going 
on or being prepared. The very first article of the ³October 10th 
Agreement² is on ³peace and national reconstruction²; don¹t these 
words on paper contradict reality? Yes, they do. That is why we 
say it still requires effort on our part to turn what is on paper into 
reality. Why does the Kuomintang mobilize so many troops to attack 
us? Because long ago it made up its mind to wipe out the people¹s 
forces, to wipe us out. Best of all, it would like to wipe us out quickly 
or, failing that, to worsen our situation and improve its own. Peace, 
though written into the agreement, has not in fact been realized. In 
53

54 MAO TSE-TUNG 
places like the Shangtang area in Shansi Province there is fighting on 
a fairly large scale. The Shangtang area, rimmed by the Taihang, 
Taiyueh and Chungtiao Mountains, is like a tub. This tub contains 
fish and meat, and Yen Hsi-shan sent thirteen divisions to grab it. 
Our policy also was set long ago ‹ to give tit for tat, to fight for every 
inch of land. This time we gave tit for tat, fought and made a very 
good job of it. In other words, we wiped out all thirteen divisions. 
Their attacking forces had 38,000 men, and we employed 31,000 men. 
Of their 38,000 men, 35,000 were destroyed, 2,000 fled and 1,000 
scattered.2 Such fighting will continue. They want desperately to 
grab our Liberated Areas. This seems hard to explain. Why are 
they so anxious to grab? Isn¹t it good for the Liberated Areas to 
be in our hands, in the hands of the people? Yes, but that is only 
what we think, what the people think. If they thought so too, there 
would be unity and we would all be ³comrades². But they won¹t 
think this way; they will oppose us stubbornly. They can¹t see why 
they shouldn¹t oppose us. It is quite natural that they should attack 
us. For our part, we can¹t see why we should let them seize our 
Liberated Areas. It is also quite natural that we should counterattack. 
When two ³can¹t-see-whys² come together, they fight. Since 
there are two can¹t-see-whys, why have they negotiated? And why 
have they concluded the ³October 10th Agreement²? In this world, 
things are complicated and are decided by many factors. We should 
look at problems from different aspects, not from just one. In Chungking, 
some people think that Chiang Kai-shek is unreliable and deceitful 
and that negotiations with him can lead nowhere. So I was told 
by many people I met, including some members of the Kuomintang. 
I told them that what they said was justified and well-founded and 
that we were firmly convinced by eighteen years of experience3 that 
this would be the case. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party 
are sure to fail in their negotiations, sure to start fighting and sure to 
break with each other, but that is only one aspect of the matter. 
Another aspect is that many other factors are bound to make Chiang 
Kai-shek have misgivings. Among these factors, the three main ones 
are the might of the Liberated Areas, the opposition to civil war by 
the people in the Great Rear Area and the international situation. 
In our Liberated Areas there are 100 million people, one million troops 
and two million people¹s militia, a force no one dares to belittle. Our 
* This report was made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung to a meeting of cadres in 
Yenan after his return from Chungking.

55 ON CHUNGKING NEGOTIATIONS 
Party¹s place in the nation¹s political life is no longer what it was in 
1927, nor what it was in 1937. The Kuomintang, which has always 
refused to recognize the equal status of the Communist Party, is now 
forced to do so. Our work in the Liberated Areas has already influenced 
all China and the whole world. The people in the Great 
Rear Area desire peace and need democracy. When in Chungking, 
I had a profound sense of the warm support given us by the broad 
masses of the people. They are dissatisfied with the Kuomintang 
government and place their hopes on us. I also met many foreigners, 
including Americans, who sympathize with us. The broad masses of 
the people in foreign countries are dissatisfied with the reactionary 
forces in China and sympathize with the Chinese people¹s forces. 
They also disapprove of Chiang Kai-shek¹s policies. We have many 
friends in all parts of the country and of the world; we are not isolated. 
Those who oppose civil war in China and stand for peace and democracy 
include not only the people in our Liberated Areas but also the 
masses in the Great Rear Area and throughout the world. The 
subjective desire of Chiang Kai-shek is to maintain his dictatorship 
and destroy the Communist Party, but many objective difficulties stand 
in his way. Therefore, he has to be a little realistic. He is being 
realistic, and we are realistic too. He was realistic in inviting us and 
we were realistic in going to negotiate with him. We arrived in 
Chungking on August 28. On the evening of the 29th, I told the 
Kuomintang representatives that the country had needed peace and 
unity ever since the September 18th Incident in 1931.4 We had asked for 
peace and unity, but they had not materialized. Peace and unity 
materialized only after the Sian Incident of 19365 before the outbreak 
of the War of Resistance on July 7, 1937. During the eight years 
of that war we fought together against Japan. But civil war never 
stopped; there were continuous frictions, big and small. To say that 
there was no civil war is deception and does not square with facts. 
In the past eight years we repeatedly expressed our willingness to 
negotiate. At the Seventh Congress of our Party we declared that 
³we are willing to resume negotiations with the Kuomintang authorities 
as soon as they are willing to renounce their present erroneous 
policies and agree to democratic reforms².6 In the negotiations we 
declared that, first, China needs peace and, second, China needs democracy. 
Chiang Kai-shek could find no reason to object and had to 
agree. On the one hand, the policy of peace and the agreements on 
democracy published in the ³Summary of Conversations² are words

56 MAO TSE-TUNG 
on paper and not yet reality; on the other hand, they have been determined 
by a variety of forces. The forces of the people in the Liberated 
Areas, the forces of the people in the Great Rear Area, the international 
situation ‹ the general trend has forced the Kuomintang to accept 
these things. 
How to give ³tit for tat² depends on the situation. Sometimes, 
not going to negotiations is tit-for-tat; and sometimes, going to negotiations 
is also tit-for-tat. We were right not to go before, and also 
right to go this time; in both cases we have given tit for tat. We 
did well to go this time, for we exploded the rumour spread by the 
Kuomintang that the Communist Party did not want peace and unity. 
They sent three successive telegrams to invite us, and we went. But 
they were totally unprepared, and we had to make all the proposals. 
As a result of the negotiations, the Kuomintang has accepted the 
general policy of peace and unity. That¹s fine. If the Kuomintang 
launches civil war again, it will put itself in the wrong in the eyes of 
the whole nation and the whole world, and we shall have all the 
more reason to smash its attacks by a war of self-defence. Now 
that the ³October 10th Agreement² has been concluded, our task is to 
uphold the agreement, to demand that the Kuomintang honour it and 
to continue to strive for peace. If they fight, we will wipe them out 
completely. This is the way things are: if they attack and we wipe 
them out, they will have that satisfaction; wipe out some, some satisfaction; 
wipe out more, more satisfaction; wipe out the whole lot, 
complete satisfaction. China¹s problems are complicated, and our 
brains must also be a little complicated. If they start fighting, we fight 
back, fight to win peace. Peace will not come unless we strike hard 
blows at the reactionaries who dare to attack the Liberated Areas. 
Some comrades have asked why we should concede eight Liberated 
Areas.7 It is a great pity to concede these eight areas, but it is better 
to do so. Why is it a pity? Because these Liberated Areas have 
been created and arduously built up by the people, with sweat and 
blood. Therefore, we must explain matters clearly to the people and 
make appropriate arrangements in the areas we are going to concede. 
Why should we concede those areas? Because otherwise the Kuomintang 
will not feel easy. They are going back to Nanking, but some 
Liberated Areas in the south are right by their beds or in their corridor. 
So long as we are there, they will not be able to sleep easily and will 
therefore fight for those places at all costs. Our concession on this 
point will help frustrate the Kuomintang¹s plot for civil war and win

57 ON CHUNGKING NEGOTIATIONS 
us the sympathy of the numerous middle elements at home and abroad. 
All the means of propaganda in China, except the Hsinhua News 
Agency, are now controlled by the Kuomintang. They are all rumour 
factories. Concerning the current negotiations, they have spread the 
rumour that the Communist Party just wants territory and will make 
no concessions. Our policy is to protect the fundamental interests of 
the people. Subject to the principle of not damaging the fundamental 
interests of the people, it is permissible to make certain concessions 
in exchange for peace and democracy, which the people of the whole 
country need. In our past dealings with Chiang Kai-shek we also 
made concessions, and even larger ones. In 1937, to bring about the 
nation-wide War of Resistance, we voluntarily dropped the name, 
³Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Revolutionary Government², changed the 
name of our Red Army to ³National Revolutionary Army² and altered 
our policy of confiscating the land of the landlords to one of reducing 
rent and interest. This time, by conceding certain areas in the south, 
we have completely exploded the Kuomintang¹s rumours before the 
people of all China and the whole world. It is the same with the 
problem of armed forces. Kuomintang propaganda has been saying 
that the Communist Party is just scrambling for guns. But we have 
said we are ready to make concessions. First, we proposed cutting 
our present armed strength to 48 divisions. As the Kuomintang has 
263 divisions, this means our strength would be about a sixth of the 
total. Later, we proposed a further reduction to 43 divisions, about 
a seventh of the total. The Kuomintang then said they would 
reduce to 120 divisions. We said we would reduce by the same 
proportion to 24 or even 20 divisions, which would still be only a 
seventh of the total. In the Kuomintang army the proportion of 
officers as compared to soldiers is unduly large and the complement 
of a division is under 6,000. By their standard, we could form 200 
divisions out of our 1,200,000 men. But we are not going to do 
so. Therefore the Kuomintang can say nothing more and all their 
rumours are bankrupt. Does this mean that we are going to hand 
over our guns to the Kuomintang? Not that either. If we hand 
over our guns, won¹t the Kuomintang have too many? The arms of 
the people, every gun and every bullet, must all be kept, must not 
be handed over. 
The above is what I want to say to the comrades about the present 
situation. Its development shows many contradictions. In the 
negotiations between the Kuomintang and our Party, why is there

58 MAO TSE-TUNG 
agreement on some questions and not on others? Why does the 
³Summary of Conversations² speak of peace and unity, while fighting 
is actually going on? Some comrades just can¹t understand such 
contradictions. What I have said is meant to answer these questions. 
Some comrades can¹t understand why we should be willing to negotiate 
with Chiang Kai-shek, who has always been anti-Communist and 
against the people. Was our Party right or wrong in deciding at its 
Seventh Congress that we were willing to negotiate with the Kuomintang, 
provided they changed their policy? It was absolutely right. 
The Chinese revolution is a long one and victory can only be won 
step by step. China¹s future depends on our exertions. The situation 
will remain in flux for six months or so. We must redouble our efforts 
to make it develop in a direction favourable to the people of the whole 
country. 
Now, a few more words about our work. Some comrades present 
will be leaving for the front. Many, full of enthusiasm, are vying 
with each other for the opportunity to go to work there, and this active 
and fervent spirit is very valuable. But there are also a few comrades 
who have mistaken ideas, who don¹t think of the many difficulties to 
be overcome, but believe that everything will be plain sailing at the 
front and that they will have an easier time than in Yenan. Are there 
people who think that way? I believe there are. I advise such comrades 
to correct their ideas. If one goes, it is to work. What is work? 
Work is struggle. There are difficulties and problems in those places 
for us to overcome and solve. We go there to work and struggle to 
overcome these difficulties. A good comrade is one who is more eager 
to go where the difficulties are greater. The work in those places is 
hard. Hard work is like a load placed before us, challenging us to 
shoulder it. Some loads are light, some heavy. Some people prefer 
the light to the heavy; they pick the light and leave the heavy to 
others. That is not a good attitude. Some comrades are different; they 
leave ease and comfort to others and carry the heavy loads themselves; 
they are the first to bear hardships, the last to enjoy comforts. They 
are good comrades. We should all learn from their communist spirit. 
Many local cadres will be leaving their native places for the front. 
And many southern-born cadres who came to Yenan are also going 
to the front. All comrades going to the front should be mentally 
prepared, once there, to take root, blossom and bear fruit. We Communists 
are like seeds and the people are like the soil. Wherever we 
go, we must unite with the people, take root and blossom among them.

59 ON CHUNGKING NEGOTIATIONS 
Wherever our comrades go, they must build good relations with the 
masses, be concerned for them and help them overcome their difficulties. 
We must unite with the masses; the more of the masses we 
unite with, the better. We must go all out to mobilize the masses, 
expand the people¹s forces and, under the leadership of our Party, 
defeat the aggressor and build a new China. This is the policy laid 
down by the Party¹s Seventh Congress.8 We must strive to carry it 
out. China depends on the Communist Party and the people to run 
her affairs. We have the will and the way to achieve peace and 
democracy. Provided we unite even more closely with the whole 
people, China¹s affairs can be run well. 
The world after World War II has a bright future. This is the 
general trend. Does the failure of the Five Power Conference of 
Foreign Ministers in London9 mean that a third world war is about 
to break out? No. Just think, how is it possible for a third world war 
to break out right after the end of World War II? The capitalist and 
the socialist countries will yet reach compromises on a number of 
international matters, because compromise will be advantageous.10 The 
proletariat and the people of the whole world are firmly opposed to 
an anti-Soviet and anti-Communist war. In the past thirty years two 
world wars have been fought. Between World Wars I and II there 
was an interval of more than twenty years. In the half million years 
of human history, it is only in the last thirty years that world wars 
have been fought. After World War I the world made great progress. 
After World War II the world is sure to make even faster 
progress. Following World War I the Soviet Union was born and 
scores of Communist Parties were founded ‹ they did not exist before. 
After the end of World War II the Soviet Union is much 
stronger, the face of Europe is changed, the political consciousness 
of the proletariat and the people of the world is much higher and 
the progressive forces throughout the world are more closely united. 
Our China is also undergoing rapid and drastic change. The general 
trend of China¹s development is certainly for the better, not the 
worse. The world is progressing, the future is bright and no one 
can change this general trend of history. We should carry on constant 
propaganda among the people on the facts of world progress and the 
bright future ahead so that they will build their confidence in victory. 
At the same time, we must tell the people and tell our comrades that 
there will be twists and turns in our road. There are still many 
obstacles and difficulties along the road of revolution. The Seventh

60 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Congress of our Party assumed that the difficulties would be many, for 
we preferred to assume there would be more difficulties rather than 
less. Some comrades do not like to think much about difficulties. 
But difficulties are facts; we must recognize as many difficulties as 
there are and should not adopt a ³policy of non-recognition². We 
must recognize difficulties, analyse them and combat them. There are 
no straight roads in the world; we must be prepared to follow a road 
which twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap. It 
must not be imagined that one fine morning all the reactionaries will 
go down on their knees of their own accord. In a word, while the 
prospects are bright, the road has twists and turns. There are still 
many difficulties ahead which we must not overlook. By uniting with 
the entire people in a common effort, we can certainly overcome all 
difficulties and win victory. 
NOTES 
1 This refers to the ³Summary of Conversations², also known as the ³October 10th 
Agreement², which was signed by representatives of the Kuomintang and the Communist 
Party of China on October 10, 1945. In the summary, Chiang Kai-shek had to 
feign agreement with the ³basic policy of peace and national reconstruction² put forward 
by the Communist Party of China and accept ³long-term co-operation on the basis 
of peace, democracy, solidarity and unity . . . resolute avoidance of civil war and the 
building of a new China, independent, free, prosperous and powerful² and ³democratization 
of political life, nationalization of troops and equality and legality of political 
parties as ways and means absolutely essential for achieving peace and national reconstruction². 
He also had to agree to bring the Kuomintang¹s political tutelage to a 
speedy conclusion, convene a political consultative conference, ³guarantee the freedoms 
of person, belief, speech, the press, assembly and association as enjoyed by the 
people in all democratic countries in peacetime, and abolish or amend existing laws and 
decrees according to this principle², abolish the secret services, ³strictly prohibit all 
organs other than those of the judiciary and police from making arrests, conducting 
trials and imposing punishment², ³release political prisoners², ³actively carry out 
local self-government and conduct general elections from the lower level upward² 
etc. The Chiang Kai-shek government, however, stubbornly refused to recognize 
the legal status of the people¹s army and the democratic governments in the Liberated 
Areas and, on the pretexts of ³unifying the military command² and ³unifying government 
administration², insolently tried to eliminate altogether the people¹s army and 
the Liberated Areas led by the Communist Party of China; consequently no agreement 
could be reached on this question. The following are excerpts from the ³Summary 
of Conversations² concerning the negotiations on the problem of the armed forces 
and political power in the Liberated Areas; in the ³Summary² the so-called ³Government² 
refers to Chiang Kai-shek¹s Kuomintang government.

61 ON CHUNGKING NEGOTIATIONS 
³On the nationalization of troops. The Communist Party of China proposed 
that with a view to unifying the military command the Government should effect an 
equitable and rational reorganization of the armed forces of the whole country, draw 
up a programme for carrying it out in stages, make a fresh delimitation of the military 
zones and establish a conscription and replenishment system. The Communist Party 
of China stated that, given such a programme, it was ready to reduce the anti-Japanese 
troops under its command to twenty-four divisions or to a minimum of twenty divisions 
and to take prompt action to demobilize its anti-Japanese troops now distributed in 
the eight areas of Kwangtung, Chekiang, southern Kiangsu, southern Anhwei, central 
Anhwei, Hunan, Hupeh and Honan (not including northern Honan). The troops to 
be reorganized would be gradually withdrawn from the above areas to assemble in 
the Liberated Areas north of the Lunghai Railway and in northern Kiangsu and 
northern Anhwei. The Government stated that the programme for the reorganization 
of troops on a country-wide basis was under way and that the Government was willing 
to consider the reorganization of the anti-Japanese troops led by the Communist 
Party of China into twenty divisions, if the issues coming up in the present negotiations 
could all be settled. As to the question of the stationing of these troops, it stated 
further that the Communist Party of China could submit plans for discussion and 
decision. The Communist Party of China proposed that the Communist Party and 
its local military personnel should participate in the work of the National Military 
Council and its various departments, that the Government should preserve the 
existing personnel system and commission the existing personnel as officers of various 
ranks in the reorganized units, that officers not receiving appointment after reorganization 
should be assigned to different areas for training and that a fair and reasonable 
system for filling vacancies and a plan for political education should be adopted. 
The Government indicated that it had no objection to these proposals and was 
willing to discuss details. The Communist Party of China proposed that all the 
militiamen in the Liberated Areas should be organized into local self-defence corps. 
The Government indicated that such organization could be considered only where 
local conditions would so require or permit. In order to formulate concrete plans 
in regard to all the questions mentioned in this section, both sides agreed that a 
sub-committee of three be formed, with one representative each from the Board of 
Military Operations of the National Military Council, the Ministry of War and the 
Eighteenth Group Army.² 
³On local governments in the Liberated Areas. The Communist Party of China 
proposed that the Government should recognize the legal status of the popularly 
elected governments at all levels in the Liberated Areas. The Government indicated 
that, since Japan had surrendered, the term ŒLiberated Area¹ should have become 
obsolete and that government administration throughout the country should be 
unified. The initial formula advanced by the Communist Party of China was that 
the provincial and administrative areas were to be delimited afresh in the light of 
the existence of eighteen Liberated Areas and that, for the sake of unifying government 
administration, it would submit a list of all the popularly elected government 
personnel at various levels for reappointment by the Government. The Government 
indicated that, as Chairman Chiang had stated to Mr. Mao, the Central Government, 
after the unification of the military command and government administration 
throughout the country, would give consideration to the administrative personnel 
nominated by the Communist Party of China. The Government would consider 
retaining a due proportion of the administrative personnel who had served in the 
areas recovered during the War of Resistance, taking account of their record of ability 
and service, irrespective of Party affiliation. Thereupon, a second formula was

62 MAO TSE-TUNG 
proposed by the Communist Party of China, asking the Central Government to 
appoint nominees of the Communist Party of China as chairmen and members of the 
provincial governments of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the five 
provinces of Jehol, Chahar, Hopei, Shantung and Shansi, and to appoint the Communist 
Party¹s nominees as deputy chairmen and members of the six provincial 
governments of Suiyuan, Honan, Kiangsu, Anhwei, Hupeh and Kwangtung (because 
in the aforesaid eleven provinces there were extensive Liberated Areas or sections 
thereof). The Communist Party of China also requested the appointment of its 
nominees as deputy mayors of the four special municipalities of Peiping, Tientsin, 
Tsingtao and Shanghai and the participation of its nominees in the administration of 
the northeastern provinces. After many discussions on this matter, the Communist 
Party of China modified the aforesaid proposals by requesting the appointment of 
its nominees as chairmen and members of the provincial governments of the Shensi- 
Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the four provinces of Jehol, Chahar, Hopei and 
Shantung, as deputy chairmen and members of the two provincial governments of 
Shansi and Suiyuan and as deputy mayors of the three special municipalities of 
Peiping, Tientsin and Tsingtao. In reply the Government stated that while the 
Communist Party of China might nominate those of its members who had rendered 
distinguished service during the War of Resistance and who possessed administrative 
ability to the Government for appointment, the Communist Party would not be 
sincerely endeavouring to achieve unity of military command and government 
administration if it should insist upon nominating a chairman or deputy chairman or 
members of any specific provincial government. The Communist Party of China 
then said it would withdraw its second suggestion and proposed a third formula. It 
suggested that general elections be held under the existing popularly elected governments 
at all levels in the Liberated Areas, and members of all other political parties 
as well as people in different walks of life would be welcome to return to their native 
places to take part in the elections to be held under the supervision of persons 
designated by the Political Consultative Conference. A popular election was to 
be held in any county where more than half the districts and townships had already 
held popular elections. Likewise, a popular election was to be held in any province 
or administrative area where more than half the counties had already held popular 
elections. In the interest of unity of government administration, the names of all 
the officials so elected in the provincial, administrative area and county governments 
should be submitted to the Central Government for appointment by confirmation. 
The Government replied that this formula of government confirmation of appointments 
in provinces and areas was not in the interest of unity of government 
administration. The Government might, however, consider holding popular elections 
for county officials, but popular elections for the provincial governments could be 
held only after the promulgation of a national constitution, when the status of the 
province would have been defined. For the time being, only those provincial government 
officials who had been appointed by the Central Government should proceed 
to take up their posts so that conditions in the recovered areas might be restored to 
normal at the earliest possible moment. At this point, a fourth formula was proposed 
by the Communist Party of China, namely, that the status quo in all the Liberated 
Areas should temporarily be maintained until the constitutional provision for the 
popular election of provincial governments had been adopted and put into effect and 
that, for the time being, an interim arrangement be worked out in order to guarantee 
the restoration of peace and order. The Communist Party of China stated that meanwhile 
this particular problem might be submitted to the Political Consultative 
Conference for settlement. The Government insisted that unity of government

63 ON CHUNGKING NEGOTIATIONS 
administration must be carried out first, because this problem, if left unsolved, might 
become an obstacle to peace and reconstruction, and it expressed the hope that a 
concrete formula with regard to this matter could be agreed upon soon. The Communist 
Party of China agreed to hold further discussions.² 
2 Shangtang was an ancient name for the southeastern part of Shansi Province 
with Changchih as its centre. Its mountainous sections were the base of the 129th 
Division of the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan and 
formed part of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Area. In September 
1945 the Kuomintang warlord, Yen Hsi-shan, mustered thirteen divisions and, in 
co-ordination with Japanese and puppet troops, moved in successively from Linfen, 
Fushan and Yicheng and from Taiyuan and Yutse to invade Hsiangyuan, Tunliu and 
Lucheng in the Southeastern Shansi Liberated Area. In October the army and 
people of this Liberated Area counter-attacked this invading force, wiped out 
35,000 men and captured several high-ranking officers, including corps and division 
commanders. 
3 This refers to the experience gained by the Communist Party of China in its 
struggles with the Kuomintang from 1927, when the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution, 
to 1945. 
4 On September 18, 1931, the Japanese ³Kwantung Army² quartered in northeastern 
China seized Shenyang. Under Chiang Kai-shek¹s order of ³absolute 
non-resistance², the Chinese troops at Shenyang and elsewhere in the Northeast (the 
Northeastern Army) withdrew to the south of the Great Wall, and consequently the 
Japanese forces rapidly occupied the provinces of Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang. 
The Chinese people called this act of aggression committed by the Japanese invaders 
the ³September 18th Incident².

the Mountains², Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. III. 
9 From September 11 to October 2, 1945, the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet 
Union, China, the United States, Britain and France met in London to discuss peace 
treaties with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland, countries which had 
taken part in the war of aggression started by fascist Germany, and to discuss the 
disposal of the Italian colonies. No agreement was reached because the United 
States, Britain and France rejected the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet 
Union and persisted in their imperialist policy of aggression aiming at overthrowing 
the people¹s governments set up in Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria after victory in 
the and-fascist war.

THE TRUTH ABOUT 
THE KUOMINTANG ATTACKS* 
November 5, 1945
In a dispatch from Chungking, dated November 3, the United 
Press reported that Wu Kuo-chen, Director of the Propaganda Department 
of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, had declared 
that ³the government is entirely on the defensive in this war² and 
had proposed measures for ³restoring communications².1 A Hsinhua 
News Agency reporter asked the spokesman for the Communist Party 
of China about this. 
The spokesman for the Communist Party of China replied to the 
reporter as follows: What Wu Kuo-chen said about being ³on the 
defensive² is a complete lie. The Kuomintang, besides occupying the 
five Liberated Areas evacuated by our troops in eastern Chekiang, 
southern Kiangsu, central and southern Anhwei and Hunan and trampling 
on the people there, has moved more than seventy divisions of 
its regular troops into or close to most of the other Liberated Areas ‹ 
for example, those in Kwangtung, Hupeh, Honan, northern Kiangsu, 
northern Anhwei, Shantung and Hopei ‹ and has been oppressing the 
people there and attacking or preparing to attack our troops. Furthermore, 
scores of other Kuomintang divisions are heading for the 
Liberated Areas. Can this be described as being on the defensive? 
Of the eight Kuomintang divisions which reached the Hantan area 
in their drive northward from Changteh, two opposed civil war and 
favoured peace, while the other six (including three U.S.-equipped 
divisions) were compelled to lay down their arms after the troops 
and people of the Liberated Areas counter-attacked in self-defence. 
Many officers of these Kuomintang troops, including war-zone deputy 
commanders, corps commanders and deputy corps commanders, are 
now in the Liberated Areas2 and can confirm the whole truth about 
where they came from and how they were ordered to attack. Can 
65

66 MAO TSE-TUNG 
this, too, be described as being on the defensive? Our troops in the 
Liberated Areas in Honan and Hupeh Provinces are now completely 
encircled by more than twenty Kuomintang divisions from the 1st, 5th 
and 6th War Zones, with Liu Chih as field commander in charge of 
the ³suppression of Communists². Our Liberated Areas in western 
and central Honan and southern, eastern and central Hupeh have all 
been invaded and occupied by the Kuomintang forces, which burned 
and killed so wantonly that our troops commanded by Li Hsien-nien 
and Wang Shu-sheng could find no shelter and had to seek quarters 
on the Honan-Hupeh border in order to survive. But there again 
they have been closely pursued and attacked by Kuomintang troops.3 
Can this, too, be described as being on the defensive? It is the 
same in the three provinces of Shansi, Suiyuan and Chahar. In early 
October, Yen Hsi-shan ordered thirteen divisions to attack the 
Hsiangyuan-Tunliu sector in the Shangtang Liberated Area. Fighting 
in self-defence, our troops and the people there disarmed them all, 
and several commanders of corps and divisions were among the captured. 
They are now in the Taihang Liberated Area, every one alive, 
and can confirm the whole truth about where they came from and 
how they were ordered to attack. In Chungking recently, Yen Hsishan 
told all sorts of lies about how he had been attacked and how 
he had merely been ³on the defensive². Probably he had forgotten 
all about his generals: Shih Tse-po, Commander of the 19th Corps; 
Kuo Jung, Commander of the Provisional 46th Division; Chang 
Hung, Commander of the Provisional 49th Division; Li Pei-ying, Commander 
of the 66th Division; Kuo Tien-hsing, Commander of the 68th Division 
and Yang Wen-tsai, Commander of the Provisional 37th Division.4 
They are now living in our Liberated Areas and can refute any lies 
told by Wu Kuo-chen, Yen Hsi-shan and all the other reactionary 
instigators of civil war. General Fu Tso-yi, under orders, has been 
attacking our Liberated Areas in Suiyuan, Chahar and Jehol for over 
two months and on one occasion pushed right to the gates of Changchiakou 
and occupied our entire Suiyuan Liberated Area and western 
Chahar. Can this, too, be described as being on the defensive and 
not firing ³the first shot²? Our troops and people in Chahar and 
Suiyuan rose in self-defence and in their counter-attacks also captured 
* This statement prepared by Comrade Mao Tse-tung was issued in the name 
of the spokesman for the Communist Party of China. By this time Chiang Kai-shek 
had already torn up the ³October 10th Agreement², and the civil war against the 
Liberated Areas was expanding daily.

67 TRUTH ABOUT KUOMINTANG ATTACKS 
large numbers of officers and men who can all testify where they 
came from, how they attacked, and so on.5 In various battles of 
self-defence we have captured piles of ³bandit suppression² and 
anti-Communist documents, among which are the Handbook on 
Bandit Suppression, orders for ³bandit suppression²6 and other anti- 
Communist documents issued by the highest Kuomintang authorities 
but dismissed as a ³joke² by Wu Kuo-chen; these are now being 
forwarded to Yenan. All these documents are iron-clad proofs that 
Kuomintang troops have attacked the Liberated Areas. 
The Hsinhua News Agency reporter went on to ask the spokesman 
for the Communist Party of China about his views on the measures 
proposed by Wu Kuo-chen for restoring communications. The spokesman 
replied: These are nothing but stalling tactics. The Kuomintang 
authorities are mustering large forces and are trying to swamp all the 
Liberated Areas as in a great flood. Following the failure of several 
attacks in September and October, they are preparing new attacks on 
an even larger scale. And one way to obstruct these attacks and 
effectively check the civil war is not to let them transport their troops 
by rail. Like everybody else, we advocate speedy restoration of the 
lines of communication, but this can be done only after the settlement 
of the three problems of accepting the Japanese surrender, disposing 
of the puppet troops and realizing self-government in the Liberated 
Areas. Which should be settled first, the problem of communications 
or these three problems? Why are the troops of the Liberated Areas, 
which fought strenuously and bitterly against Japan for eight years, 
not qualified to accept the Japanese surrender? And why should 
other troops be put to the trouble of coming from afar to accept it? 
Every citizen has the right to punish the puppet troops; why are they 
all being incorporated into the ³national army² and ordered to attack 
the Liberated Areas? Local self-government is explicitly stipulated 
in the ³October loth Agreement², and Dr. Sun Yat-sen long ago 
advocated the popular election of provincial governors; why does the 
Kuomintang government still insist on dispatching local officials? The 
problem of communications should be speedily settled, but even more 
so, the three major problems should be speedily settled. To talk of 
restoring communications without first settling the three major problems 
can only serve to spread and prolong the civil war and help its 
instigators achieve their purpose of swamping the Liberated Areas. In 
order quickly to stop the anti-popular and anti-democratic civil war 
which has now spread all over the country, we advocate the following:

68 MAO TSE-TUNG 
(1) All the Kuomintang government forces that have entered 
the Liberated Areas in northern China, northern Kiangsu, northern 
Anhwei, central China and nearby regions to accept the Japanese 
surrender and to attack us should be withdrawn immediately to 
their original positions; the troops of the Liberated Areas should 
accept the Japanese surrender and garrison the cities and lines of 
communication; and the Liberated Areas which have been invaded 
and occupied should be restored. 
(2) All puppet troops should be immediately disarmed and 
disbanded, and in northern China, northern Kiangsu and northern 
Anhwei the Liberated Areas should take charge of such disarming 
and disbanding. 
(3) The people¹s democratic self-government in all the Liberated 
Areas should be recognized; the Central Government 
should not appoint and send out local officials; the provisions of 
the ³October 10th Agreement² should be carried out. 
The spokesman said: Only in this way can civil war be averted 
otherwise there is absolutely no safeguard against it. The documents 
captured during the three battles we fought in self-defence in Suiyuan, 
Shangtang and Hantan and such concrete actions as massive troop 
movements and attacks all give the lie to the claim of the Kuomintang 
authorities that the so-called restoration of communications is for the 
sake of the people and not of civil war. The Chinese people have been 
fooled long enough and can be fooled no longer. At present, the 
central problem is for the people of the whole country to mobilize to 
stop the civil war by every means. 
NOTES 
1 At the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of China¹s railways 
were either under the control of the army and people of the Liberated Areas or 
surrounded by them. Under the pretext of ³restoring communications², the Kuomintang 
reactionaries tried to utilize these railways to cut the Liberated Areas apart, 
transport millions of Kuomintang troops to northeastern, northern, eastern and central 
China, attack the Liberated Areas and grab the big cities. 
2 In September 1945, Kuomintang troops from the region of Chengchow and 
Hsinhsiang advanced along the Peiping-Hankow Railway to attack the Shansi-Hopei- 
Shantung-Honan Liberated Area. In late October their vanguard, comprising three 
corps, invaded the region of Tsehsien and Hantan. The army and people of the

69 TRUTH ABOUT KUOMINTANG ATTACKS 
Liberated Area rose bravely in self-defence, and after a week¹s bitter fighting General 
Kao Shu-hsun, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 11th War Zone and concurrently 
Commander of the New 8th Corps, revolted against the Kuomintang at 
Hantan and came over to us with the New 8th Corps and one column, totalling over 
ten thousand men. The other two corps retreated in confusion but were surrounded 
and disarmed. Many high-ranking officers were compelled to surrender, including 
Ma Fa-wu, another Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 11th War Zone and 
concurrently Commander of the 40th Corps, Liu Shih-jung, its Deputy Commander, 
Li Hsu-tung, its Chief of Staff, Liu Shu-sen, a Deputy Division Commander. 
3 After Japan¹s surrender the Kuomintang gathered more than twenty divisions 
from three war zones to launch large-scale attacks on the Liberated Areas in Honan 
and Hupeh Provinces. Part of the forces of Hu Tsung-nan, Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 
1st War Zone, advanced from the northwest to the east along both sides of 
the Lunghai Railway to invade the Liberated Areas in western Honan; the forces 
of Liu Chih, Commander of the 5th War Zone, advanced from the north to the south 
along both sides of the Peiping-Hankow Railway to invade the Liberated Areas in 
central Honan and central and eastern Hupeh; the forces of the 6th War Zone 
advanced from southern Hupeh to the north in concert. Most of these Kuomintang 
forces were under the command of Liu Chih. The people¹s army of the Liberated 
Areas in Honan and Hupeh put up a stubborn fight against the invaders, conserved 
its strength and moved in late October 1945 to an area on the Honan-Hupeh border 
in the Tahung and the Tungpai Mountains and around Tsaoyang. The army later 
shifted to Hsuanhuatien, east of the Peiping-Hankow Railway, because the Kuomintang 
continued to pursue and attack. 
4 About the Shangtang battle, see ³On the Chungking Negotiations², Note 2, 
p. 63 of this volume. The captured Kuomintang officers here mentioned were all 
high-ranking generals in Yen Hsi-shan¹s army. 
5 The province of Suiyuan was abolished on March 6, 1954, and became part of 
the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. General Fu Tso-yi was in 1945 Commander 
of the Kuomintang¹s 12th War Zone. His troops had been stationed at and around 
Wuyuan and Linho in western Suiyuan during the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
After Japan¹s surrender he was ordered to attack the Liberated Areas in Suiyuan, 
Jehol and Chahar Provinces. In August 1945 he occupied Kueisui (now Huhehot), 
Chining and Fengchen. In early September he occupied Hsingho, Shangyi, Wuchuan, 
Taolin, Hsintang and Liangcheng, launched massive attacks on the Liberated Areas 
in Chahar and pushed to the neighbourhood of Changchiakou. In self-defence our 
army repulsed these attacks and captured large numbers of his officers and men. 
6 The Handbook on Bandit Suppression was a counter-revolutionary pamphlet 
compiled by Chiang Kai-shek in 1933 dealing exclusively with methods of attacking 
the Chinese people¹s forces and the revolutionary bases. In 1945, after the conclusion 
of the War of Resistance, Chiang Kai-shek had it reprinted and issued to Kuomintang 
officers together with a confidential order, saying: ³The present campaign for the 
suppression of the bandits, on which the happiness of the people depends, must be 
speedily completed. You should urge your officers and men to do their utmost to 
suppress the bandits in the spirit of the resistance against Japanese aggression and 
in accordance with the Handbook on Bandit Suppression which I have compiled. 
Any meritorious action in the service of the state shall be richly rewarded, and those 
responsible for delays or mistakes shall be court-martialled. This order should be 
made known to and obeyed by all officers and men under your command engaged in 
suppressing the bandits.²


RENT REDUCTION AND PRODUCTION ARE 
TWO IMPORTANT MATTERS FOR 
THE DEFENCE OF THE LIBERATED AREAS* 
November 7, 1945
1. The Kuomintang, aided by the United States, is mobilizing all 
its forces to attack our Liberated Areas. Country-wide civil war is 
already a fact. Our Party¹s present task is to mobilize all forces, take 
the stand of self-defence, smash the attacks of the Kuomintang, defend 
the Liberated Areas and strive for the realization of peace. To achieve 
this aim the following have become very urgent tasks. See to it that 
in the Liberated Areas the peasants generally get the benefits of rent 
reduction and that the workers and other labouring people benefit by 
appropriate wage increases and improved conditions; at the same time, 
see to it that the landlords can still make a living and that the industrial 
and commercial capitalists can still make profits. Unfold a large-scale 
production drive next year, increase the output of food and daily 
necessities, improve the people¹s livelihood, provide relief for victims 
of famine and for refugees and meet the needs of the army. Only 
when the two important matters of rent reduction and production are 
well handled can we overcome our difficulties, support the war and 
win victory. 
2. As the scale of the war is now very large, many leading comrades 
are in command at the front and cannot divert their attention 
to rent reduction and production. Hence there must be division of 
labour. Those leading comrades who remain in the rear areas, in 
addition to doing a great deal of work in direct support of the front, 
must not miss the opportune time for organizing these two important 
tasks of rent reduction and production. In the next few months of the 
winter and spring, they must launch large-scale rent reduction campaigns 
and carry out rent reduction universally in all the Liberated 
Areas, and particularly in the vast newly liberated areas, so as to arouse 
71

72 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the revolutionary fervour of the great majority of the peasant masses. 
Meanwhile they must see to it that there is a new development of 
agricultural and industrial production in all the Liberated Areas in 
1946. Do not neglect rent reduction and production because of the 
new large-scale war; on the contrary, it is precisely in order to defeat 
the Kuomintang offensive that rent reduction and production must 
be stepped up. 
3. Rent reduction must be the result of mass struggle, not a favour 
bestowed by the government. On this depends the success or failure 
of rent reduction. In the struggle for rent reduction, excesses can 
hardly be avoided; as long as it is really a conscious struggle of the 
broad masses, any excesses that have occurred can be corrected afterwards. 
Only then can we persuade the masses and enable them to 
understand that it is in the interest of the peasants and the people 
as a whole to allow the landlords to make a living so that they will 
not help the Kuomintang. The present policy of our Party is still to 
reduce rents, not to confiscate land. During and following rent reduction 
we must help the great majority of the peasants to organize 
themselves into peasant associations. 
4. The key to victory in the production drive is to organize the 
great majority of the producers into mutual-aid production groups. 
An indispensable measure is to provide government credits for agriculture 
and industry. It is also very important to do farm work in 
the right season and reduce loss of working time. At present we 
must mobilize civilian manpower to support the war; on the other 
hand, we must so far as possible not miss any season for farming; 
hence we should study methods of adjustments. Army units, government 
organs and schools should continue to take part in production 
to an appropriate extent, provided it does not interfere with the war, 
with work and with study. Only thus can they better their livelihood 
and lighten the burden on the people. 
5. We already hold some large and many medium cities. It has 
become an important task for our Party to take control of the economy 
of these cities and to develop their industry, commerce and finance. 
For this purpose, it is very necessary to use all the qualified persons 
available and persuade Party members to co-operate with them and 
learn technique and methods of management from them. 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

73 RENT REDUCTION AND PRODUCTION IMPORTANT FOR DEFENCE 
6. Tell all Party members to stand firmly together with the people, 
to have concern for their economic difficulties and to regard the 
carrying out of the two important tasks of rent reduction and production 
as the key to helping the people overcome their difficulties; by 
so doing, we shall win the heartfelt support of the people and be able 
to defeat attacks by any reactionaries. Everything must still be considered 
from the standpoint of a long-term effort, manpower and 
material resources must be used sparingly, everything must be planned 
on a long-term basis; thus we will be sure to win victory.


POLICY FOR WORK 
IN THE LIBERATED AREAS 
FOR 1946* 
December 15, 1945
In the past few months our Party has gained great successes in 
leading the people in fierce struggles to clean up the Japanese and 
puppet forces and smash the attacks of the Kuomintang on the 
Liberated Areas. All our Party comrades have worked as one man 
and made marked achievements in every field. The year 1945 will 
soon be over, and in 1946 we must pay attention to the following 
points in the work in all the Liberated Areas: 
1. Smash new attacks. Since our army smashed the large-scale 
attacks on our Liberated Areas in Suiyuan, Shansi and southern 
Hopei, the Kuomintang has been moving up larger forces and making 
preparations for new attacks. If no new development makes the 
Kuomintang stop its civil war quickly, the fighting in the spring of 
1946 will be intense. Therefore, the central task of all the Liberated 
Areas is still to take a stand of self-defence and do their utmost 
to smash the Kuomintang attacks. 
2. Spread the Kao Shu-hsun movement.1 In order to smash the 
Kuomintang attacks our Party must work to disintegrate the Kuomintang 
troops which are preparing to attack or are already attacking. 
On the one hand, our army must carry on extensive, open 
political propaganda and political offensives to undermine the will 
to fight of the Kuomintang troops engaged in the civil war. On the 
other hand, we must prepare and organize uprisings within the 
Kuomintang army and spread the Kao Shu-hsun movement so that, 
at crucial moments in the fighting, large numbers of Kuomintang 
troops will follow Kao Shu-hsun¹s example and come over to the 
people, oppose the civil war and take a stand for peace. In order 
to do this work in a practical way and produce speedy results, every 
75

76 MAO TSE-TUNG 
area must, in compliance with the Central Committee directive, set 
up a special department and assign a large number of cadres to 
devote themselves to it whole-heartedly and exclusively. The leading 
bodies of each area must give this work close direction. 
3. Train the troops. The field armies of the Liberated Areas 
have already been formed in the main, and the regional troops are also 
quite numerous. Hence, for the time being, we should generally 
stop expanding the number of troops and should make use of the intervals 
between battles to stress the training of troops. This applies to 
field armies, regional troops and people¹s militia. As for the training 
courses, the main objective should still be to raise the level of technique 
in marksmanship, bayoneting, grenade-throwing and the like and 
the secondary objective should be to raise the level of tactics, while 
special emphasis should be laid on night operations. As for the method 
of training, we should unfold the mass training movement in which officers 
teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers and the soldiers teach each 
other. During 1946 we must further improve the political work in the 
army, overcome any dogmatic and formalist working styles existing in 
the army and strive to unite officers and soldiers, unite the army and 
the people, unite with friendly troops, disintegrate the enemy troops 
and ensure that the tasks of training, supply and fighting are accomplished. 
The local people¹s militia should be reorganized in accordance 
with present conditions. The army¹s rear services should be readjusted. 
Everything possible should be done to organize and expand 
the artillery and engineer units in all areas. The military academies 
should continue their work, with stress on the training of technical 
personnel. 
4. Reduce rent. In accordance with the November 7, 1945 
directive of the Central Committee,2 all areas must launch movements 
in 1946 for the reduction of rent and interest in their newly 
liberated areas, movements on a large scale, of a mass character, 
but with leadership. As for the workers, their wages should be 
appropriately raised. Through these movements the broad masses 
should be able to emancipate themselves, organize, and become the 
conscious masters of the Liberated Areas. Without these determined 
measures, the masses in the newly liberated areas will not be able 
to tell which of the two parties, the Communist Party or the Kuomintang, 
is good and which is bad; they will waver and will not 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China.

77 POLICY FOR WORK IN LIBERATED AREAS FOR 1946 
give firm support to our Party. In the old Liberated Areas the work 
of rent and interest reduction should be rechecked in order to 
consolidate those areas further. 
5. Production. All areas must follow the directive of November 
7 and promptly make every preparation to ensure that in 1946 both 
public and private production in all Liberated Areas should surpass any 
previous year in scale and in achievements. The feeling of weariness 
which has appeared among the people can be overcome only after 
the two tasks of rent reduction and production are carried out in 
earnest and with marked success. Whether or not these two tasks 
are fulfilled will finally decide victory or defeat in the political and 
military struggles of the Liberated Areas. They must not be neglected 
in any area. 
6. Finance. In 1946 the financial burden, which has become 
heavier to cover the intensive work of the recent period, must be 
brought back to normal in a planned and systematic way. There 
must be appropriate reductions for those whose burdens are too 
heavy. In the interest of the long-term effort, the number of people 
diverted from production in any area must not exceed the limits of 
local financial capacity. Troops are valued for quality rather than 
for number; in building the army this remains one of our principles. 
To develop production, ensure supply, centralize leadership, decentralize 
management, give consideration to both army and people and 
to both public and private interests, and stress both production and 
economy ‹ all these are still the proper guiding principles for solving 
our financial and economic problems. 
7. Support the government and cherish the people; support the 
army and give preferential treatment to the families of the armymen 
who fought in the War of Resistance.3 In 1946 we must perform 
these two tasks better than in the past few years. This will be of 
great significance for smashing the Kuomintang attacks and consolidating 
the Liberated Areas. In the army it should be handled 
through the ideological education of every commander and fighter, so 
that all thoroughly understand the importance of supporting the 
government and cherishing the people. As long as the army on its 
part does this job well, the local government and the people will also 
improve their relations with the army. 
8. Relief. In the Liberated Areas there are many victims of 
natural disasters, refugees, unemployed and partially unemployed, 
who urgently need relief. Whether this problem is solved well or

78 MAO TSE-TUNG 
badly has a great and widespread influence. Relief should depend 
mainly on mutual aid by the masses themselves, in addition to 
government measures. The Party and the government should encourage 
the masses to organize relief through mutual aid. 
9. Take good care of local cadres. In every Liberated Area 
today there are large numbers of cadres from other areas doing the 
leading work at all levels. This is especially true in the northeastern 
provinces. The leading bodies of each area must tirelessly counsel 
these cadres to take good care of the local cadres and treat them 
with great warmth and goodwill. Cadres from outside should make 
the selection, training and promotion of local cadres an important 
task for themselves. Only thus can our Party take root in the 
Liberated Areas. The working style of people from outside who 
look down on local people should be criticized. 
10. Calculate everything on a long-term basis. No matter how 
the situation develops, our Party must always calculate on a longterm 
basis, if our position is to be invincible. At present, our Party 
on the one hand persists in its stand for self-government and 
self-defence in the Liberated Areas, firmly opposes attacks by the 
Kuomintang and consolidates the gains won by the people of these 
areas. On the other hand, we support the democratic movement 
now developing in the Kuomintang areas (as marked by the student 
strike in Kunming4) in order to isolate the reactionaries, win numerous 
allies for ourselves and expand the national democratic united front 
under our Party¹s influence. Moreover, a delegation of our Party 
will soon attend the Political Consultative Conference of various 
parties and public figures without party affiliation, reopen negotiations 
with the Kuomintang and strive for peace and democracy throughout 
the country. However, there may yet be twists and turns. Ahead of 
us lie many difficulties. For example, our new areas and our new 
troops are still not consolidated, and we have problems in finance. 
We must face all these difficulties squarely and overcome them, 
arrange all our work on a long-term basis, pay the closest attention to 
the economical use of manpower and material resources and guard 
against any wishful thinking about easy success through good luck. 
These ten points should receive special attention in our work in 
1946, and particularly in the first half of the year. It is hoped that 
comrades in different places will carry out these policies flexibly in 
the light of local conditions. As for the work in various areas, such 
as building local political authority, doing united front work, spreading

79 POLICY FOR WORK IN LIBERATED AREAS FOR 1946 
education on current affairs inside and outside the Party and doing 
work in cities and towns near the Liberated Areas ‹ all this is important 
but we shall not dwell on it here. 
NOTES 
1 On October 30, 1945, Kao Shu-hsun, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 
11th War Zone, revolted at the civil war front in Hantan, southern Hopei Province, 
and came over to our side with one corps and one column. This had a great influence 
throughout the country. In order to intensify the work of dividing and disintegrating 
the Kuomintang troops and arousing them to revolt, the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China decided to start a propaganda campaign calling upon other 
Kuomintang officers and men to follow the example of Kao Shu-hsun and his troops, 
refuse to attack the Liberated Areas, sabotage the civil war at the front, fraternize 
with the People¹s Liberation Army, rise in revolt and come over to the side of the 
people. This was known as the Kao Shu-hsun movement. 
2 See ³Rent Reduction and Production Are Two Important Matters for the Defence 
of the Liberated Areas², pp. 71-73 of this volume. 
3 ³Support the government and cherish the people² was a slogan of the People¹s 
Liberation Army, while ³Support the army and give preferential treatment to the 
families of the armymen who fought in the War of Resistance² was a slogan of the 
Party organizations, government bodies, people¹s organizations and the masses of the 
people in the Liberated Areas. The second slogan was later changed into ³Support 
the army and give preferential treatment to the families of the revolutionary 
armymen². 
4 On the evening of November 25, 1945, more than six thousand college and middle 
school students in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, assembled at the Southwest 
Associated University to discuss current affairs and protest against the civil war. The 
Kuomintang reactionaries sent troops who surrounded the assembly, fired on the 
students with light artillery, machine-guns and rifles and placed guards around 
the university to prevent teachers and students from going home. Subsequently, 
students from Kunming¹s schools and colleges joined in a strike. On December 1 the 
Kuomintang reactionaries dispatched a large number of soldiers and secret agents to 
the Southwest Associated University and the Teachers College where they threw 
hand-grenades, killing four people and wounding over ten. This incident was known 
as the ³December 1st Massacre².


BUILD STABLE BASE AREAS 
IN THE NORTHEAST* 
December 28, 1945
1. Our Party¹s present task in the Northeast is to build base 
areas, stable military and political base areas in eastern, northern and 
western Manchuria.1 To build such base areas is no easy job; it 
requires hard and bitter struggle. Three or four years are needed to 
build such base areas. But a solid preliminary groundwork must be 
laid in the year 1946. Otherwise we may not be able to stand our 
ground. 
2. It should now be made clear that these base areas are not to 
be built in the big cities or along the main communication lines that 
are or will be occupied by the Kuomintang; under present conditions 
this is not practicable. Nor are they to be built in regions close to 
big cities or main communication lines held by the Kuomintang. The 
reason is that the Kuomintang, having seized the big cities and the 
main communication lines, will not let us build stable base areas in 
regions very close to them. Our Party should do adequate work 
and set up our first line of military defence in these regions, which 
must never be lightly abandoned. But they will be guerrilla zones 
for both parties and not our stable base areas. Therefore, the regions 
in which to build stable bases are the cities and vast rural areas 
comparatively remote from the centres of Kuomintang occupation. 
Those regions should now be designated so that we can dispose our 
forces accordingly and lead the whole Party towards this goal. 
3. After we have decided on the location of our stable base areas 
and disposed our forces and after our army¹s numerical strength has 
greatly increased, mass work will be the centre of gravity of our 
Party¹s work in the Northeast. All cadres must be made to understand 
that the Kuomintang will be stronger than our Party in the 
81

82 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Northeast for some time and that unless our starting point is to arouse 
the masses to struggle, solve their problems and rely on them in every 
way and unless we mobilize all forces to work painstakingly among 
the masses and lay a solid preliminary foundation within a year, and 
particularly in the next few critical months, we shall become isolated 
in the Northeast, be unable to build stable base areas or defeat the 
attacks of the Kuomintang and indeed may encounter immense difficulties 
or even fail. Conversely, if we rely firmly on the masses, we 
shall overcome all difficulties and reach our goal step by step. Mass 
work consists in arousing the masses for struggles to settle accounts 
with traitors and in launching campaigns for rent reduction and wage 
increases and campaigns for production. In these struggles we should 
form various kinds of mass organizations, set up Party nuclei, build 
armed units of the masses and organs of people¹s political power, 
speedily raise mass economic struggles to the level of political struggles 
and lead the masses to take part in building the base areas. The 
directive on arousing mass struggles recently issued by the Jehol 
Provincial Party Committee2 may be applied in the Northeast. Our 
Party must bring tangible material benefits to the people in the 
Northeast; only then will the masses support us and oppose the 
* This directive, drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China, was addressed to its Northeast Bureau. As soon 
as the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and the Soviet Red Army entered the 
Northeast, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese 
People¹s Liberation Army sent large numbers of cadres and troops to the Northeast 
to lead the people in wiping out the remnants of the Japanese invaders and the 
puppet ³Manchukuo² regime, cleaning out traitors, eradicating bandits and establishing 
democratic local governments at various levels. But at the same time the Kuomintang 
reactionaries, bent on exclusive control over the entire Northeast, transported 
large numbers of troops there by land, sea and air with the aid of U.S. imperialism 
and seized key places like Shanhaikuan and Chinchow which had already been 
liberated by the People¹s Liberation Army. A stern struggle was already inevitable 
in the Northeast, and this struggle was obviously going to be of special significance 
for the situation in the whole country. In this directive Comrade Mao Tse-tung 
foresaw how arduous the struggle in the Northeast would be and pointed out in good 
time that the centre of gravity of the work there should be in the cities and vast 
rural areas comparatively remote from the centres of Kuomintang occupation; that 
is, we should ³leave the high road alone and seize the land on both sides² in order to 
arouse the masses in earnest, build stable base areas, gradually accumulate strength 
and prepare for the future shift to the counter-offensive. This correct policy of the 
Central Committee and Comrade Mao Tse-tung was effectively carried out by the 
Northeast Bureau headed by Comrade Lin Piao; hence the great victory, the liberation 
of the entire Northeast three years later in November 1948.

83 BUILD STABLE BASE AREAS IN NORTHEAST 
Kuomintang attacks. Otherwise, the masses will be unable to see 
clearly which of the two parties, the Kuomintang or the Communist 
Party, is good and which is bad, may be taken in for a time by deceitful 
Kuomintang propaganda and may even turn against our Party, and 
thus an extremely unfavourable situation would be created for us in 
the Northeast. 
4. At present there is a subjective difficulty for our Party in 
the Northeast. Large numbers of our cadres and armed forces in 
the Northeast are newcomers, unfamiliar with the place and the 
people. Cadres are dissatisfied because we cannot occupy large cities 
and they are impatient with the arduous work of arousing the masses 
and building base areas. These circumstances are in contradiction 
with the present situation and the tasks of the Party. Again and 
again we must teach all cadres from other areas to pay attention to 
investigation and study, to acquaint themselves with the place and 
the people and to resolve to become one with the people of the 
Northeast, and we must train large numbers of activists and cadres 
from among the masses. We should explain to the cadres that although 
the big cities and the communication lines are in the hands 
of the Kuomintang, the situation in the Northeast is nevertheless 
favourable to us. So long as we spread among all cadres and soldiers 
the idea of arousing the masses and of building our base areas and 
so long as we mobilize all forces and quickly undertake the great 
struggle to build these base areas, we shall be able to establish ourselves 
firmly in the Northeast and in Jehol and be sure of victory. 
We must tell the cadres that they should on no account underestimate 
the strength of the Kuomintang or become impatient with arduous 
work because they think the Kuomintang is going to attack eastern 
and northern Manchuria anyhow. Of course, in making these explanations 
we should not lead the cadres to believe that the Kuomintang 
is terribly strong and that its attacks cannot be smashed. It should 
be pointed out that the Kuomintang has no deep, organized foundation 
in the Northeast and that its attacks can be smashed; it is therefore 
possible for our Party to build base areas. But the Kuomintang troops 
are now attacking the Jehol-Liaoning border, and if no blows are dealt 
them, they will attack eastern and northern Manchuria before long. 
All our Party members must therefore resolve to undertake the most 
difficult tasks, swiftly arouse the masses, build our base areas and 
smash the Kuomintang attacks in western Manchuria and Jehol

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


84 
resolutely and in a planned way. In eastern and northern Manchuria 
we should quickly prepare the conditions for smashing the Kuomintang 
attacks. We must thoroughly clear away all ideas among our cadres 
of winning easy victories through good luck, without hard and bitter 
struggle, without sweat and blood. 
5. Promptly delimit military areas and sub-areas in western, 
eastern and northern Manchuria and divide our forces into field 
armies and regional troops. Distribute a considerable part of the 
regular troops among the military sub-areas to arouse the masses, wipe 
out bandits, set up organs of political power, organize guerrillas, people¹s 
militia and self-defence forces so as to make our areas secure, 
co-ordinate with the field armies and smash the Kuomintang attacks. 
All troops must be assigned to specific areas and specific tasks; only 
in this way can they quickly unite with the people and build stable 
base areas. 
6. This time over 100,000 of our troops have entered the Northeast 
and Jehol; the army there has recently expanded by more than 
200,000, and the trend is to keep on expanding. Adding Party and 
government workers, we estimate that the total will exceed 400,000 
within a year. A situation in which such a large number of personnel, 
divorced from production, depends solely on the people of the Northeast 
for supplies certainly cannot last long and is very dangerous. 
Therefore, all army units and government organs must take part in 
production when not fighting or doing their regular work, except for 
those field armies which are concentrated and charged with major 
military actions. The year 1946 must not pass without results; the 
entire Northeast must promptly make plans accordingly. 
7. In the Northeast the direction in which the workers and intellectuals 
move is vitally important to building our base areas and 
winning future victories. Our Party should therefore give its full 
attention to work in the big cities and along the main communication 
lines and especially to winning over the workers and intellectuals. 
In view of the fact that in the early years of the War of Resistance 
our Party did not pay sufficient attention to winning over the workers 
and intellectuals to come to the base areas, the Party organizations 
in the Northeast should now do everything possible to draw workers 
and intellectuals into our army and into the various construction tasks 
in the base areas, besides paying attention to underground work in 
the Kuomintang areas.

85 BUILD STABLE BASE AREAS IN NORTHEAST 
NOTES 
1 The eastern Manchuria base area included Kirin, Hsi-an, Antu, Yenchi, Tunhua 
and other places east of the Shenyang-Changchun section of the Chinese Changchun 
Railway. The northern Manchuria base area included Harbin, Mutankiang, Pei-an 
and Kiamusze, among others. The western Manchuria base area included Tsitsihar, 
Tao-an, Kailu, Fuhsin, Chengchiatun, Fuyu and other places west of the Shenyang- 
Changchun section of the Chinese Changchun Railway. The Party also built a base 
area in southern Manchuria. It included Antung, Chuangho, Tunghua, Linchiang 
and Chingyuan and other places east of the Shenyang-Talien section of the Chinese 
Changchun Railway and Liaochung, southwest of Shenyang. The persistent struggle 
against the enemy in southern Manchuria played an important role in the building of 
base areas in the Northeast. 
2 This refers to the ³Directive on Arousing the Masses² issued by the Jehol 
Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in December 1945. It pointed 
out that the central task in arousing the masses then was to launch a mass campaign of 
accusation and retribution to settle accounts with traitors and secret agents, that 
through the campaign the enthusiasm of the masses should be heightened, their social, 
political and economic status should be raised, and that trade unions, peasant associations 
and other mass organizations should be organized and that preparations should 
be made to proceed, when this campaign was over, to a mass campaign for the reduction 
of rent and interest. In arousing the masses in the cities, we had to arouse the workers 
first so that they could play the vanguard and leading role in the campaign to settle 
accounts with traitors and secret agents. The directive also called for learning the 
entire work of city administration, for making economical use of manpower and for 
planning everything on a long-term basis.


SOME POINTS IN APPRAISAL OF 
THE PRESENT INTERNATIONAL SITUATION* 
April 28, 1946
1. The forces of world reaction are definitely preparing a third 
world war, and the danger of war exists. But the democratic forces 
of the people of the world have surpassed the reactionary forces and 
are forging ahead; they must and certainly can overcome the danger 
of war. Therefore, the question in the relations between the United 
States, Britain and France and the Soviet Union is not a question of 
compromise or break, but a question of compromise earlier or compromise 
later. ³Compromise² means reaching agreement through 
peaceful negotiation. ³Earlier or later² means several years, or more 
than ten years, or even longer. 
2. The kind of compromise mentioned above does not mean compromise 
on all international issues. That is impossible so long as 
the United States, Britain and France continue to be ruled by reactionaries. 
This kind of compromise means compromise on some issues, 
including certain important ones. But there will not be many such 
compromises in the near future. There is, however, a possibility that 
the trade relations of the United States, Britain and France with the 
Soviet Union will expand. 
3. Such compromise between the United States, Britain and 
France and the Soviet Union can be the outcome only of resolute, 
effective struggles by all the democratic forces of the world against the 
reactionary forces of the United States, Britain and France. Such 
compromise does not require the people in the countries of the capitalist 
world to follow suit and make compromises at home. The people in 
those countries will continue to wage different struggles in accordance 
with their different conditions. The principle of the reactionary forces 
in dealing with the democratic forces of the people is definitely to 
destroy all they can and to prepare to destroy later whatever they 
87

88 MAO TSE-TUNG 
cannot destroy now. Face to face with this situation, the democratic 
forces of the people should likewise apply the same principle to the 
reactionary forces. 
* This document was written to counter a pessimistic appraisal of the international 
situation at that time. In the spring of 1946, imperialism headed by the United States 
of America, together with the reactionaries in various countries, was daily intensifying 
its anti-Soviet, anti-Communist and anti-popular activities and trumpeting that ³war 
between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable² and that ³the outbreak 
of a third world war is inevitable². In these circumstances, since some comrades 
overestimated the strength of imperialism, underestimated the strength of the people, 
feared U.S. imperialism and feared the outbreak of a new world war, they showed 
weakness in the face of the armed attacks of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek reactionary 
gang and dared not resolutely oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary 
war. In this document Comrade Mao Tse-tung was combating such erroneous thinking. 
He pointed out that if the forces of the people throughout the world waged 
resolute, effective struggles against the forces of world reaction, they could overcome 
the danger of a new world war. At the same time, he pointed out that it was possible 
for the imperialist countries and the socialist countries to reach certain compromises 
but that such compromises do ³not require the people in the countries of the capitalist 
world to follow suit and make compromises at home², and that ³the people in those 
countries will continue to wage different struggles in accordance with their different 
conditions². This document was not made public at the time and was circulated only 
among some leading comrades of the Central Committee. It was distributed at the 
meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in December 
1947. Since the comrades present unanimously agreed with its contents, the full text 
was later included in ³A Circular on the Decisions Made at the Central Committee 
Meeting of December 1947², issued by the Central Committee in January 1948.

SMASH CHIANG KAI-SHEK¹S OFFENSIVE 
BY A WAR OF SELF-DEFENCE* 
July 20, 1946
1. Chiang Kai-shek, after violating the truce agreement,1 violating 
the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference2 and 
occupying Szepingkai, Changchun and other cities of ours in the Northeast, 
is now launching another large-scale offensive against us in 
eastern and northern China; later, he may again attack the Northeast. 
Only after completely smashing Chiang¹s offensive in a war of selfdefence 
can the Chinese people regain peace. 
2. Our Party and our army are making every preparation to 
smash Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive and thus to win peace. Although 
Chiang Kai-shek has U.S. aid, the feelings of the people are against 
him, the morale of his troops is low, and his economy is in difficulty. 
As for us, although we have no foreign aid, the feelings of the people 
are for us, the morale of our troops is high, and we can handle our 
economy. Therefore, we can defeat Chiang Kai-shek. The whole 
Party should be fully confident of this. 
3. For defeating Chiang Kai-shek the general method of fighting 
is mobile warfare. Therefore, the temporary abandonment of certain 
places or cities is not only unavoidable but also necessary. Certain 
places or cities are temporarily abandoned in order to win final victory, 
which would otherwise be impossible. We must make all Party members 
and all the people in the Liberated Areas understand this so that 
they will be mentally prepared. 
4. In order to smash Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive we must cooperate 
closely with the masses of the people and win over all who 
can be won over. In the rural areas, on the one hand, we should 
resolutely solve the land problem, rely firmly on the farm labourers 
and poor peasants and unite with the middle peasants; on the other 
hand, when solving the land problem, we should distinguish the 
89

90 MAO TSE-TUNG 
ordinary rich peasants and middle and small landlords from the traitors, 
bad gentry and local tyrants. We should be more strict in our 
treatment of the traitors, bad gentry and local tyrants, and more 
lenient in our treatment of the rich peasants and middle and small 
landlords. In places where the land problem has already been solved, 
we should change to a moderate attitude towards the landlord class 
as a whole, with the exception of a few reactionaries. In order to 
reduce the number of hostile elements and to consolidate the Liberated 
Areas, we should help all those landlords who have difficulty 
in making a living and induce runaway landlords to return and give 
them an opportunity to earn a living. In the cities, besides uniting 
with the working class, the petty bourgeoisie and all progressives, we 
should take care to unite with all the middle elements and isolate 
the reactionaries. Among the Kuomintang troops, we should win 
over all the possible opponents of civil war and isolate the bellicose 
elements. 
5. In order to smash Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive we must plan 
on a long-term basis. We must use our manpower and material 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Chiang Kai-shek tore up the 
³October 10th Agreement² in the winter of 1945, but his preparations for an all-out 
civil war were not complete, mainly because large numbers of Kuomintang troops 
had not yet been moved to the civil war fronts. Consequently, in January 1946, under 
the pressure of the demand of the entire people for peace and democracy, the Kuomintang 
government had to convene the Political Consultative Conference with the 
participation of the Communist Party of China and other democratic parties. The 
Conference adopted a series of resolutions favourable to peace and democracy, and 
on January 10 the Kuomintang government issued an order to cease fire. Chiang 
Kai-shek was not willing to observe the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference 
and the cease-fire order. In the first half of 1946 the Kuomintang troops 
continued to attack the Liberated Areas at many points, the attack in the Northeast 
being on a particularly large scale, and a situation was created with small-scale 
fighting south of the Great Wall and large-scale fighting north of it. Meanwhile 
the United States made very great efforts to transport and equip the Kuomintang 
troops. By the end of June 1946 Chiang Kai-shek and his U.S. masters thought that 
they were fully prepared and could wipe out the whole People¹s Liberation Army 
in three to six months. Accordingly, they launched an all-out offensive against the 
Liberated Areas, which began on June 26 with a massive encircling attack on the 
Central Plains Liberated Area. Between July and September the Kuomintang troops 
started successive large-scale attacks against the Liberated Areas of Kiangsu-Anhwei, 
Shantung, Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan, Shansi-Chahar-Hopei and Shansi-Suiyuan. 
In October they launched another large-scale attack on the Northeast Liberated Area. 
At the same time they continued to encircle the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Liberated Area 
with large numbers of troops. When the country-wide civil war broke out, the 
Kuomintang employed 193 brigades (divisions), or some 1,600,000 of its regular troops,

resources with the utmost economy and do everything possible to avoid 
waste. We must investigate and clean up the petty graft which has 
appeared in some places. We must work hard in production in order 
to become completely self-sufficient in all necessities and first of all 
in grain and cloth. We must promote the extensive planting of cotton 
and encourage every family to spin and every village to weave. 
We should start to promote this even in the Northeast. In the spheres 
of finance and supplies, we must meet the material needs of the war 
of self-defence and at the same time lighten the burden on the people, 
so that there will be some improvement in the livelihood of the people 
in our Liberated Areas even under war-time conditions. To sum up, 
we rely entirely on our own efforts, and our position is invincible; 
this is the very opposite of Chiang Kai-shek who depends entirely on 
foreign countries. We live plainly and work hard, we take care of 
the needs of both the army and the people; this is the very opposite 
of the situation in Chiang Kai-shek¹s areas, where those at the top are 
corrupt and degenerate, while the people under them are destitute. 
Under these circumstances, we shall surely be victorious. 
to attack the Liberated Areas; they constituted 80 per cent of its total strength of 248 
regular brigades (divisions), or 2,000,000 men. Under the leadership of the Central 
Committee of the Party and its bureaus and sub-bureaus, the army and people in 
the Liberated Areas fought heroically against the offensive of Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
troops. At that time there were six major theatres of war in the Liberated Areas. 
These six theatres of war and the forces of the People¹s Liberation Army fighting 
there were: 
The Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Liberated Area with People¹s Liberation 
Army forces led by Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping and other comrades. 
The Eastern China Liberated Area (including the Shantung and the Kiangsu- 
Anhwei Liberated Areas) with People¹s Liberation Army forces led by Chen Yi, 
Su Yu, Tan Chen-lin and other comrades. 
The Northeast Liberated Area with People¹s Liberation Army forces led 
by Lin Piao, Lo Jung-huan and other comrades. 
The Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area with People¹s Liberation Army 
forces led by Nieh Jung-chen and other comrades. 
The Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area with People¹s Liberation Army forces 
led by Ho Lung and other comrades. 
The Central Plains Liberated Area with People¹s Liberation Army forces 
led by Li Hsien-nien, Cheng Wei-san and other comrades. 
The People¹s Liberation Army, then totalling about 1,200,000 troops, was outnumbered 
by the enemy. It correctly carried out the strategy laid down by Comrade Mao 
Tse-tung and struck incessant, powerful blows at the invading enemy. After 
wiping out 66 regular brigades and some irregular units of the enemy, totalling 
more than 710,000 men, in about eight months, the People¹s Liberation Army halted 
the enemy¹s all-out offensive. Then, step by step, it unfolded its strategic counteroffensive.

92 MAO TSE-TUNG 
6. Difficulties lie ahead of us but they can and must be overcome. 
All Party comrades and all the troops and people in the Liberated 
Areas must unite as one, completely smash Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive 
and build an independent, peaceful and democratic new China. 
NOTES 
1 The ³truce agreement² was the agreement concluded on January 10, 1946 
between representatives of the Communist Party of China and Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
Kuomintang government. It stipulated that the troops of both parties should cease 
military operations from their respective positions as of midnight, January 13. But 
in fact Chiang Kai-shek used this agreement as a smoke-screen behind which he made 
arrangements for a major war; at the very time the cease-fire order was being transmitted, 
he ordered the Kuomintang troops ³to seize strategic points² and from then 
on moved up troops continuously to attack the Liberated Areas. By July Chiang 
Kai-shek had openly torn up the truce agreement and launched an all-out offensive 
against the Liberated Areas. 
2 The Political Consultative Conference was attended by representatives of the 
Kuomintang, the Communist Party of China and other political parties, and by personages 
without party affiliation and was held in Chungking from January 10 to 31, 
1946. The Conference adopted five agreements: 
(1) Agreement on Government Organization. This agreement affirmed that 
³the Organic Law of the National Government shall be revised with a view to 
strengthening the National Government Council². It increased the number of 
National Government Councillors and provided that ³the National Government 
Councillors shall be chosen by the President of the National Government from 
both Kuomintang and non-Kuomintang members²; that ³the appointment of 
members of various parties as National Government Councillors by the President 
of the National Government shall be made on the recommendation of the parties 
concerned, which, in case of the President¹s disapproval, shall make new recommendations²; 
that ³when the President of the National Government nominates 
as Government Councillor any personage without party affiliation, whose appointment 
is opposed by one-third of the Councillors already appointed, the President 
must reconsider the matter and make a new nomination for appointment²; and 
that ³half the National Government Councillors shall be Kuomintang members 
and the other half members of other political parties and public personages². 
The National Government Council was nominally defined as ³the supreme 
government organ in charge of state affairs², with powers to discuss and decide 
legislative principles, administrative policies and major military measures, financial 
plans and the budget as well as matters submitted by the President of the National 
Government for consideration; yet at the same time the President of the 
National Government was vested with great powers, including the power of 
nominating persons for office, the power of veto (which, though nominally limited, 
was virtually absolute, for it required a majority of three-fifths to override a 
veto, while the President¹s own party, the Kuomintang, had half the seats) and 
emergency powers. The agreement also provided that ³seven or eight members

93 SMASH CHIANG¹S OFFENSIVE BY WAR OF SELF-DEFENCE 
of the Executive Yuan shall be non-Kuomintang members who shall either hold 
the portfolios of existing ministries or hold the proposed posts of ministers of 
state without portfolio². 
(2) The Programme for Peace and National Reconstruction. This programme 
was composed of nine sections, namely, General Principles, Rights of 
the People, Political Affairs, Military Affairs, Foreign Relations, Economic and 
Financial Affairs, Education and Culture, Relief and Rehabilitation, and Overseas 
Chinese Affairs. The section on ³General Principles² provided that all 
political parties of the country shall ³unite closely to build a new China, united, 
free and democratic²; that there shall be ³political democratization, nationalization 
of troops, and equality and legality for all political parties²; and that ³political 
disputes shall be settled by political means in order to ensure peace and national 
development². The section on ³Rights of the People² provided that ³the 
freedoms of person, thought, religious belief, speech, the press, assembly, 
association, residence, movement and correspondence shall be guaranteed to 
the people² and that ³any organ or person other than the judiciary and the 
police is strictly forbidden to arrest, try and punish people, and anyone who 
violates this provision shall be punished². The section on ³Political Affairs² 
provided that ³all levels of the administration shall be overhauled, their powers 
and responsibilities unified and clearly defined, all duplicated agencies abolished, 
administrative procedures simplified and each level of administration charged 
with definite responsibilities²; that ³competent office-holders shall be protected, 
appointments to government posts based not on party affiliation but on competency 
and seniority, and the holding of concurrent posts and the practice of 
favouritism forbidden²; that ³the supervisory system shall be strictly enforced, 
corruption severely punished and facilities given to the people freely to lodge 
accusations against corrupt officials²; that ³local self-government shall be actively 
promoted and elections from the lower level upwards through universal suffrage 
carried out²; and that ³the powers of the central and local governments shall 
be defined according to the principle of fair distribution of powers, that the 
local governments may take such measures as are suitable to local circumstances, 
but those enacted by a province or county must not contradict those of the 
central government². The section on ³Military Affairs² provided that ³the 
military organizations shall be adapted to the needs of national defence, the miliary 
system reformed in line with a democratic system of government and the 
conditions in the country, military power separated from political parties, 
military authority separated from civil authority, military education improved, 
equipment be adequate and personnel and financial systems be improved 
in order to build a modernized national army² and that ³the numerical strength 
of the nation¹s troops shall be effectively reduced and reorganized in accordance 
with the provisions of the Military Reorganization Plan². The section 
on ³Economic and Financial Affairs² provided that ³the development of 
bureaucrat-capital shall be curbed and government officials strictly forbidden to 
make use of their official position and influence to engage in speculation, 
monopoly, tax evasion, smuggling, embezzlement of public funds and unlawful 
use of the means of transport², that ³rents and rates of interest shall be 
reduced, the rights of lessees protected, the payment of farm rents ensured, agricultural 
credits expanded, usury strictly prohibited in order to better the life of 
the peasants and an agrarian law to attain the objective of Œland to the tillers¹ 
shall be put into effect²; that ³labour laws shall be put into effect to improve 
working conditions²; that ³the administration of finance shall be made public, the

94 MAO TSE-TUNG 
budget system and the system of financial reports strictly adhered to, budget 
expenditures drastically reduced, revenues and expenditures balanced, central 
and local government finances defined, the currency in circulation contracted 
and the monetary system stabilized and the raising of both domestic and foreign 
loans and their uses made public and subject to supervision by public bodies²; 
and that ³the system of taxation shall be reformed and all exorbitant and 
miscellaneous levies and illegal exactions completely abolished². The section 
on ³Education and Culture² provided that ³academic freedom shall be guaranteed, 
and there shall be no interference with school and college administration 
for reasons of religious belief or political thought²; that ³the proportion of the 
national budget allocated to education and culture shall be increased²; and that 
³the war-time censorship of the press, publications, motion pictures, the drama, 
posts and telegrams shall be abolished². 
(3) Agreement on the National Assembly. This agreement provided that 
³there shall be added to the National Assembly seven hundred delegates from 
various parties and from among public personages² and that ³the duty and power 
of the first National Assembly shall be to frame and adopt a constitution². 
(4) Agreement on the Draft Constitution. This agreement provided for 
the establishment of a review committee to revise the draft constitution prepared 
by the Kuomintang and laid down the principles for revision. In addition to 
prescribing the principles governing the duties and powers of the National 
Assembly and government organizations, special provisions were made regarding 
³local government² and ³the rights and duties of the people². With 
respect to ³local government², it provided that ³the province shall be the highest 
unit of local self-government²; that ³the powers of the provincial government in 
relation to those of the central government shall be defined according to the principle 
of a fair distribution of powers²; that ³the provincial governor shall be elected 
by the people²; and that ³the province may have a provincial constitution which, 
however, must not contravene the provisions of the national constitution². With 
respect to ³the rights and duties of the people², it provided that ³all freedoms 
and rights which are generally enjoyed by the people of a democratic country 
shall be protected by the constitution against illegal violation²; that ³if any 
provision is made by law regarding the freedom of the people, it shall be aimed 
at the protection of such freedom and not at its restriction²; that ³drafting of 
labour may be provided for in local laws, but not in the national constitution²; 
and that ³the right of self-government shall be guaranteed to minority nationalities 
who live together in specific communities². 
(5) Agreement on Military Affairs. This agreement provided that ³the 
military system shall be reformed in line with a democratic system of government 
and the conditions in our country²; that ³military conscription shall be improved²; 
that ³military education shall be conducted on the basis of the principles governing 
the building of the army and shall for ever be dissociated from political parties and 
personal relationships²; that ³military power shall be separated from political 
parties² and ³all political parties and individuals shall refrain from using the 
army as an instrument of political struggle²; and that ³military authority shall 
be separated from civil authority² and ³no soldier in active service may serve 
concurrently as a civil official². With regard to the reorganization of the Kuomintang 
troops and the troops of the Liberated Areas, it provided that ³the threeman 
military sub-committee proceed as planned with all possible speed to reach an 
agreement on measures for reorganizing the troops of the Communist Party of 
China and to complete their reorganization²; that the Kuomintang troops shall

95 SMASH CHIANG¹S OFFENSIVE BY WAR OF SELF-DEFENCE 
³be reorganized according to the plan already laid down by the Ministry of War 
into ninety divisions and this reorganization shall be completed at the highest 
possible speed within six months²; and that ³when the above-mentioned two items 
of reorganization have been completed, all troops of the entire nation shall be 
unified and further reorganized into fifty or sixty divisions². 
These Political Consultative Conference agreements were, in varying degrees, favourable 
to the people and unfavourable to Chiang Kai-shek¹s reactionary rule. While 
expressing his approval of these agreements in an attempt to use them to carry out his 
peace fraud, Chiang Kai-shek actively made military preparations for launching 
a country-wide civil war. These Political Consultative Conference agreements were 
soon torn up by him one after another.


TALK WITH THE AMERICAN CORRESPONDENT 
ANNA LOUISE STRONG* 
August 1946
Strong: Do you think there is hope for a political, a peaceful 
settlement of China¹s problems in the near future? 
Mao: That depends on the attitude of the U.S. government. If 
the American people stay the hands of the American reactionaries who 
are helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, there is hope for peace. 
Strong: Suppose the United States gives Chiang Kai-shek no 
help, besides that already given,1 how long can Chiang Kai-shek 
keep on fighting? 
Mao: More than a year. 
Strong: Can Chiang Kai-shek keep on that long, economically? 
Mao: He can. 
Strong: What if the United States makes it clear that it will 
give Chiang Kai-shek no more help from now on? 
Mao: There is no sign yet that the U.S. government and Chiang 
Kai-shek have any desire to stop the war within a short time. 
Strong: How long can the Communist Party keep on? 
Mao: As far as our own desire is concerned, we don¹t want to 
fight even for a single day. But if circumstances force us to fight, we 
can fight to the finish. 
Strong: If the American people ask why the Communist Party 
is fighting, what should I reply? 
Mao: Because Chiang Kai-shek is out to slaughter the Chinese 
people, and if the people want to survive they have to defend themselves. 
This the American people can understand. 
Strong: What do you think of the possibility of the United 
States starting a war against the Soviet Union? 
Mao: There are two aspects to the propaganda about an anti- 
Soviet war. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism is indeed preparing 
97

98 MAO TSE-TUNG 
a war against the Soviet Union; the current propaganda about an 
anti-Soviet war, as well as other anti-Soviet propaganda, is political 
preparation for such a war. On the other hand, this propaganda is 
a smoke-screen put up by the U.S. reactionaries to cover many actual 
contradictions immediately confronting U.S. imperialism. These are 
the contradictions between the U.S. reactionaries and the American 
people and the contradictions of U.S. imperialism with other capitalist 
countries and with the colonial and semi-colonial countries. At 
present, the actual significance of the U.S. slogan of waging an 
anti-Soviet war is the oppression of the American people and the 
expansion of the U.S. forces of aggression in the rest of the capitalist 
world. As you know, both Hitler and his partners, the Japanese 
warlords, used anti-Soviet slogans for a long time as a pretext for 
enslavement of the people at home and aggression against other 
countries. Now the U.S. reactionaries are acting in exactly the 
same way. 
To start a war, the U.S. reactionaries must first attack the 
American people. They are already attacking the American people 
‹ oppressing the workers and democratic circles in the United 
States politically and economically and preparing to impose fascism 
* This is a very important statement made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung on the 
international and domestic situation not long after the conclusion of World War II. 
Here, Comrade Mao Tse-tung put forward his famous thesis, ³All reactionaries are 
paper tigers.² This thesis armed the people of our country ideologically, strengthened 
their confidence in victory and played an exceedingly great role in the People¹s War of 
Liberation. Just as Lenin considered imperialism a ³colossus with feet of clay², so 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung regards imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers; both 
have dealt with the essence of the matter. This thesis is a fundamental strategic concept 
for the revolutionary people. Since the period of the Second Revolutionary Civil 
War, Comrade Mao Tse-tung has repeatedly pointed out: strategically, with regard 
to the whole, revolutionaries must despise the enemy, dare to struggle against him 
and dare to seize victory; at the same time, tactically, with regard to each part, each 
specific struggle, they must take the enemy seriously, be prudent, carefully study and 
perfect the art of struggle and adopt forms of struggle suited to different times, places 
and conditions in order to isolate and wipe out the enemy step by step. On December 
1, 1958, at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China held at Wuchang, Comrade Mao Tse-tung stated: 
Just as there is not a single thing in the world without a dual nature (this is 
the law of the unity of opposites), so imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual 
nature ‹ they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time. In past history 
before they won state power and for some time afterwards, the slave-owning 
class, the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie were vigorous, revolutionary 
and progressive; they were real tigers. But with the lapse of time, because their 
opposites ‹ the slave class, the peasant class and the proletariat ‹ grew in strength

there. The people of the United States should stand up and resist 
the attacks of the U.S. reactionaries. I believe they will. 
The United States and the Soviet Union are separated by a 
vast zone which includes many capitalist, colonial and semi-colonial 
countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. Before the U.S. reactionaries 
have subjugated these countries, an attack on the Soviet Union is 
out of the question. In the Pacific the United States now controls 
areas larger than all the former British spheres of influence there 
put together; it controls Japan, that part of China under Kuomintang 
rule, half of Korea, and the South Pacific. It has long controlled 
Central and South America. It seeks also to control the whole of 
the British Empire and Western Europe. Using various pretexts, 
the United States is making large-scale military arrangements and 
setting up military bases in many countries. The U.S. reactionaries 
say that the military bases they have set up and are preparing to 
set up all over the world are aimed against the Soviet Union. True, 
these military bases are directed against the Soviet Union. At 
present, however, it is not the Soviet Union but the countries in which 
these military bases are located that are the first to suffer U.S. 
aggression. I believe it won¹t be long before these countries come 
step by step, struggled against them and became more and more formidable, these 
ruling classes changed step by step into the reverse, changed into reactionaries, 
changed into backward people, changed into paper tigers. And eventually they 
were overthrown, or will be overthrown, by the people. The reactionary, backward, 
decaying classes retained this dual nature even in their last life-and-death 
struggles against the people. On the one hand, they were real tigers; they ate people, ate 
people by the millions and tens of millions. The cause of the people¹s 
struggle went through a period of difficulties and hardships, and along the path 
there were many twists and turns. To destroy the rule of imperialism, feudalism 
and bureaucrat-capitalism in China took the Chinese people more than a hundred 
years and cost them tens of millions of lives before the victory in 1949. Look! 
Were these not living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers? But in the end they changed 
into paper tigers, dead tigers, bean-curd tigers. These are historical facts. 
Have people not seen or heard about these facts? There have indeed been thousands 
and tens of thousands of them! Thousands and tens of thousands! Hence, 
imperialism and all reactionaries, looked at in essence, from a long-term point of 
view, from a strategic point of view, must be seen for what they are ‹ paper tigers. 
On this we should build our strategic thinking. On the other hand, they are 
also living tigers, iron tigers, real tigers which can eat people. On this we 
should build our tactical thinking. 
For the necessity of despising the enemy strategically and taking full account of him 
tactically, see ³Strategic Problems of China¹s Revolutionary War², Chapter 5, Section 
6, Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. I, and ³On Some Important Problems of 
the Party¹s Present Policy², Section 1, pp. 181-82 of this volume.

100 MAO TSE-TUNG 
to realize who is really oppressing them, the Soviet Union or the 
United States. The day will come when the U.S. reactionaries find 
themselves opposed by the people of the whole world. 
Of course, I do not mean to say that the U.S. reactionaries have 
no intention of attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is 
a defender of world peace and a powerful factor preventing the 
domination of the world by the U.S. reactionaries. Because of the 
existence of the Soviet Union, it is absolutely impossible for the 
reactionaries in the United States and the world to realize their 
ambitions. That is why the U.S. reactionaries rabidly hate the 
Soviet Union and actually dream of destroying this socialist state. 
But the fact that the U.S. reactionaries are now trumpeting so 
loudly about a U.S.-Soviet war and creating a foul atmosphere, so 
soon after the end of World War II, compels us to take a look at 
their real aims. It turns out that under the cover of anti-Soviet slogans 
they are frantically attacking the workers and democratic circles in 
the United States and turning all the countries which are the targets 
of U.S. external expansion into U.S. dependencies. I think the 
American people and the peoples of all countries menaced by U.S. 
aggression should unite and struggle against the attacks of the U.S. 
reactionaries and their running dogs in these countries. Only by 
victory in this struggle can a third world war be avoided; otherwise 
it is unavoidable. 
Strong: That is very clear. But suppose the United States uses 
the atom bomb? Suppose the United States bombs the Soviet Union 
from its bases in Iceland, Okinawa and China? 
Mao: The atom bomb is a paper tiger which the U.S. reactionaries 
use to scare people. It looks terrible, but in fact it isn¹t. 
Of course, the atom bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the 
outcome of a war is decided by the people, not by one or two new 
types of weapon. 
All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries 
are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From 
a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people 
who are really powerful. In Russia, before the February Revolution 
in 1917, which side was really Strong? On the surface the tsar 
was Strong but he was swept away by a single gust of wind in the 
February Revolution. In the final analysis, the strength in Russia 
was on the side of the Soviets of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. 
The tsar was just a paper tiger. Wasn¹t Hitler once considered

101 TALK WITH ANNA LOUISE STRONG 
very Strong? But history proved that he was a paper tiger. So was 
Mussolini, so was Japanese imperialism. On the contrary, the strength 
of the Soviet Union and of the people in all countries who loved 
democracy and freedom proved much greater than had been foreseen. 
Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters, the U.S. reactionaries, are 
all paper tigers too. Speaking of U.S. imperialism, people seem to 
feel that it is terrifically Strong. Chinese reactionaries are using the 
³strength² of the United States to frighten the Chinese people. But 
it will be proved that the U.S. reactionaries, like all the reactionaries 
in history, do not have much strength. In the United States there 
are others who are really Strong ‹ the American people. 
Take the case of China. We have only millet plus rifles to rely 
on, but history will finally prove that our millet plus rifles is more 
powerful than Chiang Kai-shek¹s aeroplanes plus tanks. Although 
the Chinese people still face many difficulties and will long suffer 
hardships from the joint attacks of U.S. imperialism and the Chinese 
reactionaries, the day will come when these reactionaries are 
defeated and we are victorious. The reason is simply this: the 
reactionaries represent reaction, we represent progress. 
NOTES 
1 To help Chiang Kai-shek start civil war against the people, U.S. imperialism 
gave his government a very great amount of aid. By the end of June 1946 the United 
States had equipped 45 Kuomintang divisions. It had trained 150,000 Kuomintang 
military personnel ‹ army, naval and air forces, secret agents, communications police, 
staff officers, medical officers, supply personnel, etc. U.S. warships and aircraft transported 
to the front against the Liberated Areas 14 Kuomintang corps (41 divisions) 
and 8 regiments of the communications police corps, or over 540,000 men in all. The 
U.S. government landed 90,000 of its marines in China and stationed them at such 
important cities as Shanghai, Tsingtao, Tientsin, Peiping and Chinwangtao. They 
guarded the lines of communication for the Kuomintang in northern China. According 
to data disclosed in United States Relations with China (The White Paper), released 
by the State Department on August 5, 1949, the total value of various kinds of U.S. 
aid given to the Chiang Kai-shek government from the time of the War of Resistance 
Against Japan to 1948 was more than 4,500 million dollars (the overwhelming bulk 
of U.S. aid given during the War of Resistance had been hoarded by the Kuomintang 
for the ensuing civil war against the people). But the actual amount of U.S. aid to 
Chiang Kai-shek far exceeded this total. The U.S. White Paper admitted that U.S. aid 
was equivalent to ³more than 50 percent of the monetary expenditures² of the Chiang 
Kai-shek government and was of ³proportionately greater magnitude in relation to 
the budget of that Government than the United States has provided to any nation of 
Western Europe since the end of the war².


CONCENTRATE A SUPERIOR FORCE 
TO DESTROY THE ENEMY FORCES 
ONE BY ONE* 
September 16, 1946
1. The method of fighting by concentrating a superior force to 
destroy the enemy forces1 one by one must be employed not only in 
the disposition of troops for a campaign but also in the disposition of 
troops for a battle. 
2. With regard to the disposition for a campaign, when the enemy 
employs many brigades2 (or regiments) and advances against our 
army from several directions, our army must concentrate an absolutely 
superior force ‹ six, five, four or at least three times the enemy 
strength ‹ and pick an opportune moment to encircle and wipe out 
one enemy brigade (or regiment) first. It should be one of the 
enemy¹s weaker brigades (or regiments), or one that has less support, 
or one stationed where the terrain and the people are most favourable 
to us and unfavourable to the enemy. We should tie down the rest of 
the enemy brigades (or regiments) with small forces in order to prevent 
them from rushing reinforcements to the brigade (or regiment) 
we are encircling and attacking so that we can destroy it first. When 
this has been achieved, we should, according to the circumstances, 
either wipe out one or several more enemy brigades or retire to rest 
and consolidate for further fighting. (Here are two examples of the 
former. Our troops under the command of Su Yu and Tan Chen-lin 
wiped out five thousand of the enemy¹s communications police corps3 
near Jukao on August 22, one enemy brigade on August 26 and one 
and a half brigades on August 27.4 Our troops under Liu Po-cheng 
and Teng Hsiao-ping annihilated one enemy brigade near Tingtao 
between September 3 and 6, another in the afternoon of September 6 
and two more on September 7-8.5) In the disposition for a campaign, 
we must reject the wrong method of fighting, which underrates 
103

the enemy and therefore divides our forces to deal with all the enemy 
detachments, for by this method we cannot destroy even one enemy 
detachment but will land ourselves in a passive position. 
3. In the disposition for a battle, when we have concentrated an 
absolutely superior force and encircled one of the enemy detachments 
(a brigade or regiment), our attacking formations (or units) should 
not attempt to wipe out all the encircled enemy simultaneously at one 
swoop and thus divide themselves and strike everywhere without 
enough strength anywhere, losing time and making it hard to get results. 
Instead, we should concentrate an absolutely superior force, that is to 
say, a force six, five, four or at least three times that of the enemy, 
concentrate the whole or the bulk of our artillery, select one (not two) 
of the weak spots in the enemy¹s positions, attack it fiercely and be 
sure to win. This accomplished, swiftly exploit the victory and destroy 
the enemy forces one by one. 
4. The effects of this method of fighting are, first, complete annihilation 
and, second, quick decision. Only complete annihilation 
can deal the most telling blows to the enemy, for when we wipe out 
one regiment, he will have one regiment less, and when we wipe out 
one brigade, he will have one brigade less. This method is most 
useful when employed against an enemy lacking second-line troops. 
Only complete annihilation can replenish our own forces to the greatest 
possible extent. It is now not only the main source of our arms 
and ammunition, but also an important source of our manpower. 
Complete annihilation demoralizes the enemy¹s troops and depresses 
his followers; it raises the morale of our troops and inspires our people. 
A quick decision makes it possible for our troops either to wipe out 
the enemy reinforcements one by one or evade them. Quick decision 
in battle and campaign is a necessary condition for the strategy of a 
protracted war. 
5. Among our military cadres there are still many who, when 
not in action, approve the principle of concentrating our forces to 
wipe out the enemy forces one by one, but often fail to apply it in 
action. That is due to underestimation of the enemy and to lack of 
intensive education and study. It is necessary to cite detailed cases 
of past battles to explain again and again the advantages of this 
method of fighting and to point out that it is the chief method of 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China.

105 CONCENTRATE SUPERIOR FORCE TO DESTROY ENEMY ONE BY ONE 
defeating Chiang Kai-shek¹s attacks. Using this method we shall 
win. Acting counter to it we shall lose. 
6. The principle of concentrating our forces to wipe out the 
enemy forces one by one has been a fine tradition of our army ever 
since its founding more than a decade ago; this is not the first time it 
has been put forward. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, 
however, the dispersal of our forces for guerrilla warfare was primary, 
and the concentration of our forces for mobile warfare was supplementary. 
In the present civil war, as conditions have changed, so 
should the method of fighting. The concentration of our forces for 
mobile warfare should be primary, and the dispersal of our forces 
for guerrilla warfare should be supplementary. Now that Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s army has acquired more powerful weapons, it is necessary 
for our army to lay special stress on the method of concentrating a 
superior force to wipe out the enemy forces one by one. 
7. When the enemy is on the offensive and we are on the defensive, 
this method must be employed. However, when the enemy is 
on the defensive and we are on the offensive, we should distinguish 
between two kinds of situations and adopt different methods. When 
our force is big and the enemy in that locality is rather weak, or when 
we are making a surprise attack on the enemy, we may strike at several 
of his units simultaneously. For example, between June 5 and 10, our 
troops in Shantung Province simultaneously attacked and captured 
more than ten towns on the Tsingtao-Tsinan and the Tientsin-Pukow 
Railways.6 Or to take another example, between August 10 and 21, 
our troops under Liu Po-cheng and Teng Hsiao-ping attacked and 
captured more than ten towns along the section of the Lunghai Railway 
between Kaifeng and Hsuchow.7 On the other hand, when we 
do not have enough forces, we should seize the enemy-occupied towns 
one by one and should not attack the enemy at several towns simultaneously. 
That was how our forces in Shansi Province took the 
towns along the Tatung-Puchow Railway.8 
8. When the main force of our troops is concentrated to annihilate 
the enemy, it must co-ordinate its operations with vigorous activities 
by the regional formations, local guerrillas and people¹s militia. When 
regional formations (or troops) attack an enemy regiment, battalion 
or company, they should also adopt the principle of concentrating our 
forces to annihilate the enemy forces one by one. 
9. The principle of concentrating our forces to wipe out the enemy 
forces one by one is aimed chiefly at annihilating the enemy¹s effective

106 MAO TSE-TUNG 
strength, not at holding or seizing a place. In some circumstances, it 
is permissible to abandon certain places for the purpose of concentrating 
our forces to wipe out the enemy or of enabling our main force to avoid 
heavy enemy attacks and to facilitate rest and consolidation for further 
fighting. So long as we are able to wipe out the enemy¹s effective 
strength on a large scale, it will be possible to recover lost territory 
and seize new territory. Therefore, all those who succeed in destroying 
the enemy¹s effective strength should be commended. This applies 
not only to those who destroy the enemy¹s regular forces but also to 
those who destroy his peace preservation corps, home-going contingents9 
and other reactionary local armed bands. However, we must 
hold or seize territory wherever the relative strength of the enemy 
and our own forces makes this possible or wherever such territory is 
significant for our campaigns or battles; to do otherwise would be a 
mistake. Therefore, those who succeed in holding or seizing such 
territory should also be commended. 
NOTES 
1 The expressions ³to destroy the enemy², ³to wipe out the enemy² and ³to 
annihilate the enemy² are used as synonyms in this book. They all include enemy 
troops killed, wounded and captured. To wipe out (annihilate, destroy) an enemy 
force means either to wipe it out completely or to wipe out the major part of that force. 
2 A regular corps of the Kuomintang army originally consisted of three (sometimes 
two) divisions, each with three regiments. Beginning in May 1946 the Kuomintang 
regular troops south of the Yellow River were reorganized in stages; what had been 
a corps became a reorganized division and former divisions became brigades, each 
with three (sometimes two) regiments. Part of the Kuomintang troops north of the 
Yellow River were not reorganized, and their designations remained the same. Some 
of the reorganized divisions later reverted to their original designation of corps. 
3 The communications police corps of the Kuomintang was formed in March 1945. 
Following Japan¹s surrender, the corps was deployed along communication lines for 
³garrison duties² under the pretext of guarding the railways, but actually to carry on 
secret police activities. It was one of the forces the Kuomintang used for fighting 
the civil war. 
4 In July 1946 the Kuomintang forces began a large-scale invasion of the Kiangsu- 
Anhwei Liberated Area, and our army fought bravely in self-defence. The Kuomintang 
troops attacking the Central Kiangsu Liberated Area consisted of fifteen brigades with 
about 120,000 men under Tang En-po. From July 13 to August 27, eighteen regiments 
of the Eastern China People¹s Liberation Army, commanded by Su Yu, Tan Chen-lin 
and other comrades, concentrated superior forces and fought seven successive battles 
in the region of Taihsing, Jukao, Hai-an and Shaopai in central Kiangsu. Our forces

107 CONCENTRATE SUPERIOR FORCE TO DESTROY ENEMY ONE BY ONE 
wiped out six enemy brigades and five battalions of the enemy¹s communications 
police corps. The text refers to the results of two of these battles. 
5 In August 1946 the Kuomintang forces advanced along two routes from the 
Hsuchow and Chengchow sectors and attacked the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan 
Liberated Area. The People¹s Liberation Army of this area, under the command of 
Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping and other comrades, concentrated superior forces to 
engage the enemy detachment advancing from Chengchow. Between September 3 
and 8 they wiped out four enemy brigades in succession in the region of Hotse, Tingtao 
and Tsaohsien in Shantung Province. 
6 Early in June 1946 the Shantung People¹s Liberation Army sent an expedition 
against the puppet troops along the Tsingtao-Tsinan and Tientsin-Pukow Railways 
and liberated more than ten towns, including Chiaohsien, Changtien, Choutsun, 
Tehchow, Tai-an and Tsaochuang. 
7 From August 10 to 21, 1946, the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People¹s Liberation 
Army, supporting the Central Plains and Eastern China People¹s Liberation 
Armies, moved by several routes and attacked the enemy troops stationed along the 
Kaifeng-Hsuchow section of the Lunghai Railway, capturing more than ten towns, 
including Tangshan, Lanfeng, Huangkou, Lichuang and Yangchi. 
8 In July 1946 the Kuomintang forces under Hu Tsung-nan and Yen Hsi-shan 
jointly attacked the Southern Shansi Liberated Area. The Taiyueh units of the 
Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People¹s Liberation Army and a part of the Shansi- 
Suiyuan People¹s Liberation Army counter-attacked and beat back the enemy in 
southern Shansi. In August they started an offensive against the enemy between 
Linfen and Lingshih along the Tatung-Puchow Railway and liberated the towns of 
Hungtung, Chaocheng, Huohsien, Lingshih and Fenhsi. 
9 During the People¹s War of Liberation some landlords and local tyrants in the 
Liberated Areas fled to the Kuomintang areas. They were organized by the Kuomintang 
into ³home-going contingents², ³home-going legions² and other reactionary 
armed bands to attack the Liberated Areas together with the Kuomintang troops. 
Everywhere they robbed, killed and committed all kinds of atrocities.


THE TRUTH ABOUT U.S. ³MEDIATION² 
AND THE FUTURE OF 
THE CIVIL WAR IN CHINA 
Talk with the American Correspondent 
A. T. Steele 
September 29, 1946
Steele: Sir, do you consider that the U.S. effort to mediate in 
the Chinese civil war has failed? If the policy of the United States 
continues as at present, what will it lead to? 
Mao: I doubt very much that the policy of the U.S. government 
is one of ³mediation².1 Judging by the large amount of aid the United 
States is giving Chiang Kai-shek to enable him to wage a civil war 
on an unprecedented scale, the policy of the U.S. government is to 
use the so-called mediation as a smoke-screen for strengthening Chiang 
Kai-shek in every way and suppressing the democratic forces in China 
through Chiang Kai-shek¹s policy of slaughter so as to reduce China 
virtually to a U.S. colony. The continuation of this policy will certainly 
arouse the firm resistance of all patriotic people throughout 
China. 
Steele: How long will the Chinese civil war go on? What will 
be its outcome? 
Mao: If the U.S. government abandons its present policy of aiding 
Chiang Kai-shek, withdraws its forces now stationed in China and 
carries out the agreement reached at the Moscow Conference of the 
Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain,2 
the Chinese civil war is sure to end at an early date. Otherwise it 
may turn into a long war. This would of course bring suffering to the 
Chinese people, but on the other hand, the Chinese people would 
certainly unite, fight for survival and decide their own fate. Whatever 
109

110 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the difficulties and hardships, the Chinese people will certainly fulfil 
their task of achieving independence, peace and democracy. No 
forces of suppression, domestic or foreign, can prevent the fulfilment 
of this task. 
Steele: Sir, do you consider Chiang Kai-shek the ³natural 
leader² of the Chinese people? Is the Communist Party of China 
going to reject Chiang Kai-shek¹s five demands3 in all circumstances? 
If the Kuomintang tries to convene a National Assembly without the 
participation of the Communist Party,4 what action will the Communist 
Party take? 
Mao: There is no such thing in the world as a ³natural leader². 
If Chiang Kai-shek deals with the political, military, economic and 
other problems of China in accordance with the truce agreement5 
signed last January and the joint resolutions then adopted by the 
Political Consultative Conference,6 and not in accordance with the 
so-called ³five demands² or ten demands, which are one-sided and 
run counter to the agreement and joint resolutions, we will still be 
willing to work with him. The National Assembly must be convened 
jointly by various political parties, in line with the resolutions adopted 
by the Political Consultative Conference; otherwise we will firmly 
oppose it. 
NOTES 
1 In December 1945 the U.S. government sent George C. Marshall to China 
as the president¹s special representative and used ³mediation in the hostilities 
between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China² as a cover for 
strengthening the U.S. forces of aggression and the reactionary Kuomintang rule 
in various ways. To gain time to prepare for his civil war, Chiang Kai-shek, prompted 
by U.S. imperialism, pretended to accept the demand of the Chinese Communist 
Party and the Chinese people to stop the civil war. In January 1946 representatives 
of the Kuomintang government and the Chinese Communist Party signed a truce 
agreement, issued a cease-fire order and formed the ³Committee of Three² and the 
³Peiping Executive Headquarters² with the participation of U.S. representatives. 
During the ³mediation², Marshall resorted to all kinds of ruses to help the Kuomintang 
forces attack the Liberated Areas, first in northeastern China and later in 
northern, eastern and central China; he actively trained and equipped the Kuomintang 
troops and supplied Chiang Kai-shek with a vast amount of arms and other war 
materiel. By June 1946 Chiang Kai-shek had massed 80 per cent of his regular forces 
(which were about two million men) at the front for attacks on the Liberated Areas; 
more than 540,000 of these troops were transported directly by the warships and 
planes of the U.S. armed forces. In July, when the disposition of his troops had

111 TRUTH ABOUT U.S. ³MEDIATION² 
been completed, Chiang Kai-shek launched a country-wide counter-revolutionary war. 
Subsequently, on August 10, Marshall and Leighton Stuart, U.S. ambassador to 
China, issued a joint statement declaring that ³mediation² had failed in order to give 
Chiang Kai-shek a free hand to wage civil war. 
2 This refers to the agreement on China reached at the Moscow Conference of 
the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain in December 
1945. In the conference communique the three foreign ministers ³reaffirmed their 
adherence to the policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of China². The 
foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States agreed that Soviet and 
U.S. forces should be withdrawn from China at the earliest possible time. The 
Soviet Union faithfully carried out the terms of this agreement. It was only because 
of repeated requests from the Kuomintang government that the Soviet forces postponed 
the date of withdrawal. On May 3, 1946, the armed forces of the Soviet Union completed 
their withdrawal from northeastern China. But the U.S. government broke 
its promise completely, refused to withdraw its troops and stepped up its interference 
in China¹s internal affairs. 
3 On two occasions, in June and August 1946, Chiang Kai-shek put forward 
his ³five demands² to the Chinese Communist Party, declaring that only if the 
Communist Party accepted them would the Kuomintang consider stopping the civil 
war. The five demands stipulated that the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army withdraw 
from the following places: (1) all areas south of the Lunghai Railway; (2) the 
entire length of the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway; (3) Chengteh and the area south of it; 
(4) most of northeastern China; and (5) all areas liberated since June 7, 1946, from the 
puppet troops in Shantung and Shansi Provinces by the people¹s armed forces of the 
Liberated Areas. The Chinese Communist Party categorically rejected all these 
counter-revolutionary demands. 
4 According to the resolution of the Political Consultative Conference held in 
January 1946, the National Assembly was to be an assembly of democracy and unity, 
in which various political parties would take part, and was to be convened under 
the auspices of a reorganized government after the terms of the agreements reached 
at the Political Consultative Conference had been carried out. On October 11, 1946, 
the Kuomintang troops occupied Changchiakou, and this ³victory² turned the heads 
of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. On that very afternoon it openly violated the terms 
of the PCC resolution and ordered the convening of a divisive and dictatorial 
³National Assembly² controlled exclusively by the Kuomintang. Officially opened 
in Nanking on November 15, 1946, this ³National Assembly² was firmly opposed 
and boycotted by the Chinese Communist Party, the democratic parties and the 
entire people.

p. 92 of this volume.

A THREE MONTHS¹ SUMMARY* 
October 1, 1946
1. The Central Committee¹s directive of July 20 on the current 
situation1 stated: ³We can defeat Chiang Kai-shek. The whole 
Party should be fully confident of this.² The fighting in July, August 
and September has proved this judgement to be correct. 
2. Apart from the fundamental political and economic contradictions 
which Chiang Kai-shek cannot resolve and which are the basic 
cause rendering our victory certain and Chiang¹s defeat inevitable, a 
sharp contradiction has arisen in the military sphere between Chiang¹s 
over-extended battle lines and his shortage of troops. That contradiction 
is bound to be the direct cause of our victory and Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s defeat. 
3. The total of Chiang Kai-shek¹s regular troops attacking the 
Liberated Areas, not counting the puppet troops, the peace preservation 
corps and communications police corps, is more than 190 brigades. 
Besides this total, the most he can do is again to move part of his 
troops from the south to the north as reinforcements; but after that 
it will be hard for him to send any more reinforcements. Of the 190 
odd brigades, 25 have been wiped out by our army in the past three 
months. This does not include the forces we wiped out in the 
Northeast from February to June this year. 
4. Of Chiang Kai-shek¹s more than 190 brigades, nearly half 
must perform garrison duties; only a little more than half can be put 
into the field. And when these field forces advance to certain regions, 
part or even a majority will have to switch over to garrison duty. 
The enemy¹s field forces are bound to dwindle as the fighting goes 
on because, first, they will be continually wiped out by us and, second, 
many will have to perform garrison duties. 
5. Of the 25 brigades we destroyed in the past three months, 7 
were under the command of Tang En-po (previously under Li Mo-an), 
113

114 MAO TSE-TUNG 
2 under Hsueh Yueh, 7 under Ku Chu-tung (previously under Liu 
Chih), 2 under Hu Tsung-nan, 4 under Yen Hsi-shan, 2 under Wang 
Yao-wu and 1 under Tu Yu-ming. Only the 4 groups under Li 
Tsung-jen, Fu Tso-yi, Ma Hung-kuei and Cheng Chien have not yet 
received crushing blows from our army; all the remaining 7 groups 
have received serious blows or initial blows. Those who have received 
serious blows are Tu Yu-ming (taking into account the fighting in the 
Northeast from February to June this year), Tang En-po, Ku Chutung 
and Yen Hsi-shan. Those who have received initial blows are 
Hsueh Yueh, Hu Tsung-nan and Wang Yao-wu. All this proves that 
our army can defeat Chiang Kai-shek. 
6. In the coming period our task is to wipe out some 25 more 
enemy brigades. The completion of this task will make it possible 
to halt Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive and recover part of our lost territory. 
It can be predicted that after wiping out this second batch 
of 25 brigades our army will certainly be able to seize the strategic 
initiative and go over from the defensive to the offensive. Our task 
then will be to destroy a third batch of 25 enemy brigades. If we 
achieve that, we can recover most or even all of the lost territory and 
expand the Liberated Areas. By that time a tremendous change will 
surely have taken place in the relative military strength of the Kuomintang 
and the Communist Party. To attain this we must follow up 
our great achievement of wiping out 25 brigades in the past three months 
and destroy about 25 more in the coming three months or so. This is 
the key to changing the situation as between the enemy and ourselves.2 
7. In the past three months we have lost a few dozen medium 
and small towns, such as Huaiyin, Hotse, Chengteh and Chining. The 
abandonment of most of these towns was unavoidable and it was 
right to abandon them temporarily on our own initiative. Some others 
we were forced to abandon because we did not fight well. In any 
case, we shall be able to recover our lost territory, provided we fight 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It summed up in detail the 
series of experiences in the three months of fighting beginning with the outbreak of 
the country-wide civil war in July 1946, set forth the strategy and fighting tasks of 
the People¹s Liberation Army from then on and pointed out that after overcoming 
a period of difficulties we were certain to win victory in the People¹s War of Liberation. 
The directive also explained in principle the problems which needed to be 
solved for the support of and in co-ordination with the People¹s War of Liberation, 
such as land reform, the development of production in the Liberated Areas, the 
strengthening of leadership in the mass struggles in the Kuomintang areas and other 
relevant problems.

115 A THREE MONTHS¹ SUMMARY 
well from now on. In the future there may still be places we cannot 
prevent the enemy from taking, but we shall be able to recover all of 
them later. All areas should critically review their past experience 
in fighting in order to draw lessons and avoid repeating mistakes. 
8. In the past three months our Central Plains Liberation Army 
has shown matchless stamina in overcoming difficulties and hardships 
and, aside from that part of the army which has moved into the old 
Liberated Areas, its main force has established two guerrilla bases in 
southern Shensi and western Hupeh.3 Moreover, in both eastern 
and central Hupeh our troops are persisting in guerrilla warfare. 
All this has greatly helped, and is still helping, the fighting in the old 
Liberated Areas, and it will play a greater role in the long war ahead. 
9. In the past three months of war we have pinned down south 
of the Great Wall several of Chiang Kai-shek¹s crack forces, which 
he had originally planned to send to the Northeast, and have thus 
gained time for resting and consolidating our troops and for arousing 
the masses in the Northeast. This, too, is of great significance for 
our future struggles. 
10. To concentrate a superior force to wipe out the enemy forces 
one by one is the only correct method of fighting, the method we have 
used in the past three months to destroy 25 enemy brigades. Only by 
concentrating a force six, five, four or at least three times as strong as 
the enemy¹s force can we be effective in wiping it out. This must be 
done both in campaigns and in battles. This method of fighting must 
be mastered not only by all high-ranking commanders but also by all 
middle and lower-ranking cadres. 
11. In the past three months, in addition to 25 regular brigades 
of the enemy, our army has destroyed considerable numbers of reactionary 
forces, such as puppet troops, peace preservation corps and 
communications police corps; this also is a great achievement. We 
should continue to annihilate such troops in large numbers. 
12. The experience of the past three months has proved that in 
order to wipe out 10,000 enemy troops we have to pay a price of 
2,000 to 3,000 casualties of our own. This is unavoidable. To cope 
with a long war (and everything, everywhere should be considered 
with such a war in mind) we must expand our army in a planned way, 
ensure that our main forces are always kept at full strength and train 
large numbers of military cadres. We must develop production and 
regulate finances according to plan and firmly put into effect the 
principles of developing our economy and ensuring supply, of unified

116 MAO TSE-TUNG 
leadership and decentralized management and of giving consideration to 
both the army and the people and to both public and private interests. 
13. The experience of these three months has proved that higher 
fighting efficiency was shown by all troops who, during the period of 
the truce from January to June, intensified their military training 
according to the directives of the Central Committee (which has 
repeatedly instructed the various areas to regard troop training, production 
and land reform as their three central tasks). It has also 
proved that all troops not so trained showed much lower fighting 
efficiency. From now on, all areas must utilize the intervals between 
battles for intensified military training. All army units must strengthen 
their political work. 
14. The experience of these three months has proved that the 
peasants stood with our Party and our army against the attacks of 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s troops wherever the Central Committee¹s directive 
of May 44 was carried out firmly and speedily and the land problem 
was solved radically and thoroughly. The peasants took a wait-andsee 
attitude wherever the ³May 4th Directive² was not carried out 
firmly or the arrangements were made too late, or wherever this work 
was mechanically divided into stages or land reform was neglected 
on the excuse of preoccupation with the war. In the coming few 
months all areas, no matter how busy they are with the war, must 
resolutely lead the peasant masses to solve the land problem and, on 
the basis of the land reform, make arrangements for large-scale production 
work next year. 
15. The experience of these three months has proved that 
wherever the regional armed forces, including the people¹s militia, the 
guerrillas and the armed working teams,5 are well organized, we can 
control vast rural areas even though many points and lines are temporarily 
occupied by the enemy. But wherever the regional armed forces 
are weak and the leadership is poor, the enemy is given a much easier 
time. From now on, in areas temporarily occupied by the enemy, 
we must strengthen the Party¹s leadership, develop the regional armed 
forces, persevere in guerrilla warfare, safeguard the interests of the 
masses and strike blows at the activities of the reactionaries. 
16. Three months of war have almost exhausted the reserve 
forces of the Kuomintang and seriously weakened its military strength 
in its own areas. At the same time, the Kuomintang¹s resumption of 
conscription and grain levies6 has aroused popular discontent and 
created a situation favourable for the development of mass struggles.

117 A THREE MONTHS¹ SUMMARY 
The whole Party must strengthen its leadership of the mass struggles 
in the Kuomintang areas and intensify the work of disintegrating the 
Kuomintang army. 
17. The Kuomintang reactionaries, under the direction of the 
United States, have violated the truce agreement and the resolutions 
of the Political Consultative Conference of January this year and are 
determined to wage the civil war in their attempt to destroy the people¹s 
democratic forces. All their fine words are nothing but humbug; we 
must expose all the plots of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek. 
18. In these three months the broadest strata of the people in 
the Kuomintang areas, including the national bourgeoisie,7 have 
quickly arrived at a better understanding of the fact that the Kuomintang 
and the United States government are working in collusion, 
have started the civil war and are oppressing the people. More and 
more people now realize the truth that Marshall¹s mediation is a 
fraud and that the Kuomintang is the arch-criminal of the civil war. 
The broad masses, disillusioned with the United States and the Kuomintang, 
now place their hopes on the victory of our Party. This 
domestic political situation is extremely favourable. The reactionary 
policy of U.S. imperialism is rousing increasing discontent among 
the broad masses of the people in all countries. The level of political 
consciousness of the people in all countries is rising every day. The 
people¹s democratic struggle is mounting in all capitalist countries, 
the strength of the Communist Parties in many countries has greatly 
increased, and it will be impossible for the reactionaries to reduce 
them to submission. The might of the Soviet Union and its prestige 
among the peoples are growing daily. The U.S. reactionaries and 
the reactionaries whom they support in other countries are bound 
to become more and more isolated. This international political 
situation is extremely favourable. The situation both at home and 
abroad differs greatly from that after World War I. The revolutionary 
forces have grown tremendously since World War II. We 
can defeat the Chinese and foreign reactionaries, no matter how rampant 
they are (this rampancy is historically inevitable and not at all 
strange). Leading comrades in all areas should explain this fully to 
those comrades in the Party who are gloomy about the future of the 
struggle owing to their inadequate understanding of the favourable 
situation at home and abroad. It must be made clear that the enemy 
still has strength, that we ourselves still have some weaknesses and 
that the struggle is still a long and cruel one. But we can certainly

118 MAO TSE-TUNG 
win victory. This understanding and conviction must be firmly 
established throughout the Party. 
19. The coming few months will be an important and difficult 
period. We must strenuously mobilize the whole Party, undertake 
meticulously planned military operations and radically change the 
military situation. All areas must resolutely carry out the above 
policies and strive for a radical change in the military situation.

this volume. 
2 Later developments showed that the situation between the enemy and ourselves 
began to change in July 1947, when the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People¹s 
Liberation Army forced the Yellow River and marched towards the Tapieh Mountains. 
By then the People¹s Liberation Army had fought for twelve months and 
wiped out about a hundred enemy brigades, averaging eight a month. This exceeded 
the estimate made in this article because, with the support of U.S. imperialism, 
Chiang Kai-shek had used all his available forces in the offensive. 
3 At the end of June 1946 the Central Plains Liberation Army led by Li 
Hsien-nien, Cheng Wei-san and other comrades initiated a strategic shift of its 
forces and victoriously broke through an encirclement by 300,000 Kuomintang troops. 
The units mentioned by Comrade Mao Tse-tung as having moved into the old 
Liberated Areas were those led by Wang Chen and other comrades; they entered 
the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region after breaking through the encirclement. 
The guerrilla base in southern Shensi was founded by a part of the main force of the 
Central Plains Liberation Army and included Lushih and Hsichuan in western Honan 
and Lonan and Shanyang in southern Shensi. The guerrilla base in western Hupeh 
was set up by another part of the same army with the Wutang Mountains in 
northwestern Hupeh as its centre. 
4 This refers to the ³Directive on the Land Question² issued by the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China on May 4, 1946. After Japan¹s surrender, 
in view of the peasants¹ eager demand for land, the Central Committee decided to 
change the land policy of the period of the War of Resistance, that is, to change from 
the reduction of rent and interest to confiscation of the land of the landlords and its 
distribution among the peasants. The ³May 4th Directive² marked this change. 
5 The armed working teams were small working teams which went deep into 
the enemy-occupied areas to organize the masses and strike blows at the enemy. 
Such a team consisted of cadres drawn from various organizations ‹ the Communist 
Party, the governments in the Liberated Areas, the people¹s army and mass organizations 
‹ and was equipped with some weapons. This was a convenient form of 
organization for carrying out activities in the enemy-occupied areas. 
6 This refers to land taxes in kind. 
7 The national bourgeoisie is the section of the bourgeoisie which has little or 
no connection with imperialism, as distinguished from that section of the bourgeoisie 
which is closely dependent on imperialism and is comprador in character, that is, the 
big bourgeoisie or bureaucrat-capitalists.

GREET THE NEW HIGH TIDE OF 
THE CHINESE REVOLUTION* 
February 1, 1947
1. All circumstances now show that the situation in China is 
about to enter a new stage of development. This new stage is one 
in which the country-wide struggle against imperialism and feudalism 
will develop into a great new people¹s revolution. We are now on 
the eve of this revolution. The task of our Party is to struggle for 
the advent of this high tide and its triumph. 
2. The military situation has now developed in a direction 
favourable to the people. In seven months of fighting, from last July 
to this January, we wiped out 56 brigades of Chiang Kai-shek¹s regular 
forces which invaded the Liberated Areas, a monthly average of 8 
brigades, not counting the numerous puppet troops and the peace 
preservation corps which were wiped out and those of Chiang¹s regular 
forces which were routed. Although Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive continues 
in southern and western Shantung, in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia 
Border Region, along the northern section of the Peiping-Hankow 
Railway and in southern Manchuria, it has become much feebler than 
it was last autumn. Chiang Kai-shek¹s army does not have enough 
troops to dispose and cannot fulfil its conscription quotas; this fact 
is in serious contradiction with its extended battle lines and the enormous 
drain on its manpower. The morale of Chiang¹s army is sinking 
lower every day. During the recent fighting in northern Kiangsu, 
southern and western Shantung and western Shansi, the morale of 
many of Chiang¹s forces sank to a very low level. On several fronts 
our armies are beginning to seize the initiative, while Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
armies are beginning to lose it. We can foresee that in the next few 
months we may achieve the objective of wiping out a grand total of 
100 of Chiang¹s brigades, including those previously destroyed. Chiang 
Kai-shek has altogether 93 regular infantry and cavalry divisions 
119

120 MAO TSE-TUNG 
(corps), composed of 248 brigades (divisions), totalling 1,916,000 men, 
not counting the puppet troops, police, local peace preservation corps, 
communications police corps, rear services and technical arms. The 
forces attacking the Liberated Areas number 78 divisions (corps), 
composed of 218 brigades (divisions), totalling 1,713,000 men, or about 
90 per cent of Chiang Kai-shek¹s regular troops. Only 15 divisions, 
with 30 brigades, totalling 203,000 men, or about 100 per cent of the 
total, remain in the Kuomintang rear areas. Therefore, Chiang Kaishek 
can no longer send large combat-worthy reinforcements from his 
rear areas to attack the Liberated Areas. We have already wiped 
out more than a quarter of the 218 brigades attacking the Liberated 
Areas. Although some have been replenished and restored under 
their original designations after having been wiped out, their combat 
effectiveness is very low. Some have been wiped out a second time. 
Some have not been replenished at all. If our armies can wipe out 
another 40 to 50 brigades in the next few months and bring the grand 
total up to about 100, there will be an important change in the military 
situation. 
3. Meanwhile, a great people¹s movement is unfolding in the 
Kuomintang areas. The riots of the people in Shanghai,1 which began 
on November 30 of last year as a result of the Kuomintang¹s persecution 
of the street vendors, and the student movement in Peiping, which 
began last December 30 as a result of the rape of a Chinese girl student 
by U.S. soldiers,2 both mark a new upsurge in the struggle of the 
people in the Chiang Kai-shek areas. The student movement which 
began in Peiping has spread to other big cities all over the country, 
with hundreds of thousands taking part and on a larger scale than the 
December 9th Student Movement against Japanese imperialism.3 
4. The victories of the People¹s Liberation Army in the Liberated 
Areas and the development of the people¹s movement in the Kuomintang 
areas foretell that a great new people¹s revolution against 
imperialism and feudalism is surely approaching and can be victorious. 
5. The circumstances in which this situation has arisen are that 
U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek have replaced 
Japanese imperialism and its running dog Wang Ching-wei and 
adopted the policies of turning China into a U.S. colony, launching a 
civil war and strengthening the fascist dictatorship. Confronted by 
these reactionary policies of U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

121 GREET NEW HIGH TIDE OF CHINESE REVOLUTION 
the Chinese people have no way out except through struggle. The 
struggle for independence, peace and democracy still constitutes the 
basic demand of the Chinese people in the present period. As far 
back as April 1945, our Party¹s Seventh National Congress foresaw the 
possibility that U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek would carry out 
these reactionary policies and formulated a complete and fully correct 
political line to defeat them. 
6. These reactionary policies of U.S. imperialism and Chiang 
Kai-shek have forced all strata of the Chinese people to unite for their 
own salvation. These strata include the workers, peasants, urban petty 
bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, other patriotic 
elements, the minority nationalities and overseas Chinese. This is 
a very broad united front of the whole nation. In comparison with 
the united front in the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, 
it is not only as broad in scope but has even deeper foundations. All 
Party comrades must strive to consolidate and develop this united 
front. In the Liberated Areas the policy of the ³three thirds system²4 
is to remain unchanged, on the condition that the policy of land to the 
tillers is carried out resolutely and unhesitatingly. In addition to Communists, 
we should continue to draw the broad ranks of progressives 
outside the Party and the middle elements (such as the enlightened 
gentry) into the organs of political power and into social undertakings. 
In the Liberated Areas, all citizens, irrespective of class, sex 
or belief, have the right to elect and stand for election, except traitors 
and those reactionaries who have opposed the interests of the people 
and incurred their bitter hatred. After the system of land to the tillers 
has been thoroughly carried out, the right to private property of the 
people in the Liberated Areas will continue to be guaranteed. 
7. Because the Chiang Kai-shek government has pursued reactionary 
financial and economic policies for a long time and because 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s bureaucrat-comprador capital5 has become linked 
with U.S. imperialist capital through the notorious and treasonable 
Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce,6 malignant inflation has swiftly 
developed; the industry and commerce of China¹s national bourgeoisie 
are daily going bankrupt; the livelihood of the working masses, 
government employees and teachers is deteriorating every day; large 
numbers of middle class elements are losing their savings and becoming 
penniless; and therefore strikes of workers and students and other 
struggles are constantly occurring. An economic crisis more serious 
than China has ever faced before is threatening all strata of the people.

122 MAO TSE-TUNG 
In order to carry on the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has restored the 
extremely vicious system of conscription and grain levies of the period 
of the War of Resistance; this makes life impossible for the vast rural 
population, particularly the poverty-stricken peasants; as a result, 
peasant revolts have already started and will continue to spread. 
Hence, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique will become 
more and more discredited in the eyes of the broad masses of the people 
and be confronted with serious political and military crises. On the 
one hand, this situation is daily pushing forward the people¹s antiimperialist, 
anti-feudal movement in the areas under Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
control; on the other hand, it is further demoralizing Chiang¹s troops 
and increasing the possibility of victory by the People¹s Liberation 
Army. 
8. The illegal and divisive ³National Assembly², which was convened 
by Chiang Kai-shek in order to isolate our Party and other 
democratic forces, and the bogus constitution fabricated by that body 
enjoy no prestige at all among the people. Instead of isolating our 
Party and other democratic forces, they have isolated the reactionary 
Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique itself. Our Party and other democratic 
forces adopted the policy of refusing to participate in the bogus National 
Assembly; this was perfectly correct. The reactionary Chiang 
Kai-shek ruling clique has brought over to its side the Youth Party7 
and the Democratic Socialist Party,8 two small parties which never had 
the slightest prestige in Chinese society, as well as certain so-called 
³public personages²,9 and it can be foreseen that some of the middleof-
the-roaders may also go over to the side of reaction. The reason 
is that the democratic forces in China are getting stronger and stronger 
while the reactionary forces are becoming more and more isolated, 
and therefore the line between the enemy and ourselves has to be so 
sharply drawn. All elements which hide in the democratic front and 
deceive the people will eventually be revealed in their true colours 
and be cast aside by the people; and the people¹s anti-imperialist and 
anti-feudal ranks will grow even stronger because they have drawn 
a clear line of demarcation between themselves and these hidden 
reactionaries. 
9. The development of the international situation is extremely 
favourable for the Chinese people¹s struggle. The growing might of 
the Soviet Union and the successes of its foreign policy, the growing 
radicalization of the peoples of the world and their ever-developing 
struggles against reactionary forces both at home and abroad ‹ these

123 GREET NEW HIGH TIDE OF CHINESE REVOLUTION 
two great factors have forced U.S. imperialism and its running dogs 
in various countries into ever greater isolation and will continue to do 
so. If one adds the factor of an inevitable economic crisis in the 
United States, then U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will be forced 
into an even worse predicament. The power of U.S. imperialism and 
its running dog Chiang Kai-shek is only temporary; their offensives 
can be smashed. The myth that the offensives of the reactionaries 
cannot be smashed should have no place in our ranks. The Central 
Committee has pointed this out time and again, and the development 
of the international and domestic situation has increasingly borne out 
the correctness of this judgement. 
10. In order to gain a respite in which to replenish his troops and 
launch a fresh offensive, to obtain new loans and munitions from the 
United States and to allay the indignation of the people, Chiang Kaishek 
is perpetrating a new hoax by demanding the resumption of 
so-called peace negotiations with our Party.10 Our Party¹s policy is 
not to refuse negotiations and in this way expose his deception. 
11. In order to smash Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive thoroughly, we 
must wipe out another forty to fifty of his brigades in the next few 
months; this is the key that will decide everything. To achieve this 
objective, we must put into full effect the Central Committee¹s directive 
of October 1 last year, ³A Three Months¹ Summary²,11 and the Military 
Commission¹s directive of September 16 last year on concentrating our 
forces to destroy the enemy forces one by one.12 Here, we are once 
again emphasizing a few points for the attention of the comrades in 
all areas: 
(a) The Military Problem. In the past seven months of bitter 
fighting our army has proved that it can certainly smash Chiang Kaishek¹s 
offensive and win final victory. Our army has improved in 
both equipment and tactics. From now on, the central task in building 
our armed forces is to make every effort to step up the building of 
our artillery and engineer corps. All military areas, big and small, 
and all field armies should solve the concrete problems involved in 
strengthening the artillery and engineer corps and, first of all, the two 
problems of training cadres and manufacturing ammunition. 
(b) The Land Problem. In about two-thirds of the territory in 
each Liberated Area, the Central Committee¹s directive of May 4, 
1946,13 has been put into effect, the land problem has been solved and 
the policy of land to the tillers has been carried out; this is a great 
victory. There remains around one-third of the territory, however,

124 MAO TSE-TUNG 
where further efforts must be made to arouse the masses fully and put 
the policy of land to the tillers into effect. In places where the policy 
of land to the tillers has been carried out, there are still shortcomings 
insofar as the solution was not thorough ‹ mainly because the masses 
were not fully aroused, so that the confiscation and the distribution 
of land were not thorough and the masses became dissatisfied. In 
such places, we must check carefully and must ³even up²14 to ensure 
that the peasants with little or no land obtain some and the bad gentry 
and local tyrants are punished. In the entire process of carrying out 
the policy of land to the tillers, we must unite firmly with the middle 
peasants, and it is absolutely impermissible to encroach on the interests 
of the middle peasants (including the well-to-do middle peasants); 
if cases occur where the interests of the middle peasants are encroached 
upon, there must be compensation and apology. Moreover, during 
and after the land reform, appropriate consideration in accordance 
with the will of the masses should be given to ordinary rich peasants 
and middle and small landlords, and it should be given in accordance 
with the ³May 4th Directive². To sum up, in the land reform movement 
in the rural areas we must unite with the more than go per cent 
of the masses who support the reform and isolate the small number 
of feudal reactionaries who oppose it so that we can speedily realize 
the policy of land to the tillers. 
(c) The Production Problem. All places must plan on a longterm 
basis, work hard at production, practise economy and correctly 
solve the financial problem on the basis of production and economy. 
The first principle here is to develop production and ensure supply. 
For this reason, we must oppose the wrong view which lays one-sided 
emphasis on finance and commerce and neglects agricultural and 
industrial production. The second principle is to give consideration 
to both the army and the people, to both public and private interests. 
Therefore, we must oppose the wrong view which takes only one side 
into account and neglects the other. The third principle is unified 
leadership and decentralized management. Therefore, except where 
conditions call for centralized management, we must oppose the wrong 
view which favours centralizing everything, regardless of circumstances, 
and which dares not give full rein to decentralized management. 
12. Our Party and the Chinese people have every assurance of 
final victory; there is not the slightest doubt about it. But that does 
not mean there are no difficulties before us. China¹s anti-imperialist 
and anti-feudal struggle is protracted in nature, Chinese and foreign

125 GREET NEW HIGH TIDE OF CHINESE REVOLUTION 
reactionaries will continue to oppose the Chinese people with all their 
strength, fascist rule in the areas under Chiang Kai-shek¹s control will 
be intensified; certain parts of the Liberated Areas will temporarily 
become enemy-occupied areas or guerrilla zones, some of the revolutionary 
forces may suffer temporary losses, and there will be losses 
of manpower and material resources in a long war. The comrades 
throughout the Party must take all this fully into account and be 
prepared to overcome all difficulties with an indomitable will and in 
a planned way. The reactionary forces and we both have difficulties. 
But the difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable 
because they are forces on the verge of death and have no future. Our 
difficulties can be overcome because we are new and rising forces and 
have a bright future. 
NOTES 
1 Beginning in August 1946 the Kuomintang authorities in Shanghai forbade the 
street vendors in the Whangpoo and Louza districts to carry on their business. In 
late November nearly a thousand who were still operating were arrested. On 
November 30 three thousand street vendors demonstrated and surrounded the 
Whangpoo district police station. The Kuomintang authorities gave the order to 
fire; seven demonstrators were killed and a great many were wounded and arrested. 
On December 1, the street vendors continued their struggle. Despite the fact that 
ten more were killed and over a hundred wounded, the number taking part in the 
struggle grew to over five thousand. All shops in Shanghai closed down to show 
sympathy. Thus the incident developed into a city-wide mass movement against 
Chiang Kai-shek. 
2 This incident occurred in Peiping on December 24, 1946. A girl student of 
Peking University was raped by U.S. soldiers. Consequently, from December 30 
through January 1947, students in scores of big and medium cities in the Kuomintang 
areas struck and demonstrated against the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, demanding 
the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. More than half a million students took 
part in this movement. 
3 In 1935 a new upsurge began in the patriotic movement of the people of the whole 
country. Students in Peking, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, 
were the first to hold a patriotic demonstration on December 9, putting forward such 
slogans as ³Stop the civil war and unite to resist foreign aggression² and ³Down with 
Japanese imperialism!² This movement broke open the long reign of terror imposed 
by the Kuomintang government in league with the Japanese invaders and soon won the support of 
the people throughout the country. It is known as the ³December 9th 
Movement². As a consequence, new changes became manifest in the relations among 
various classes in the country, and the Anti-Japanese National United Front proposed 
by the Communist Party of China became the openly advocated policy of

126 MAO TSE-TUNG 
all patriotic people. The Kuomintang government became very isolated with its 
traitorous policy. 
4 The ³three thirds system² was the Chinese Communist Party¹s policy for 
united front organs of political power in the Liberated Areas during the War of 
Resistance Against Japan. According to this policy, the proportion of personnel in 
the anti-Japanese democratic political organs was about one-third each for Communist 
Party members, for left progressives, and for middle elements and others. 
5 See ³The Present Situation and Our Tasks², Section 6, pp. 167-69 of this 
volume. 
6 The ³Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce² or ³Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce 
and Navigation² was concluded between the Chiang Kai-shek government and 
the U.S. government on November 4, 1946, in Nanking. This treaty, which sold out a 
large part of China¹s sovereignty to the United States, contains thirty articles, the 
main contents of which are as follows: 
(1) U.S. nationals shall enjoy in ³the whole extent of . . . the territories² 
of China the rights to reside, travel, carry on commercial, manufacturing, processing, 
scientific, educational, religious and philanthropic activities, explore and 
exploit mineral resources, lease and hold land, and follow various occupations and 
pursuits. In regard to economic rights U.S. nationals in China shall be accorded 
the same treatment as Chinese. 
(2) In respect of taxation, sale, distribution and use in China, U.S. commodities 
shall be accorded treatment no less favourable than that accorded to 
the commodities of any third country or to Chinese commodities. ³No prohibition 
or restriction shall be imposed² by China on the importation from the 
United States of any article grown, produced or manufactured in the United 
States, or on the exportation to the United States of any Chinese article. 
(3) U.S. vessels shall have the freedom of sailing in any of the ports, places 
or waters in China which are open to foreign commerce or navigation, and their 
personnel and freight shall have freedom of transit through Chinese territory ³by 
the routes most convenient². On the pretext of ³any . . . distress², U.S. vessels, 
including warships, can sail into ³any of the ports, places or waters² of China 
which are ³not open to foreign commerce or navigation². 
Wellington Koo, then Chiang Kai-shek¹s ambassador to the United States, openly 
and shamelessly stated that this treaty meant ³the opening of the entire territory of 
China to U.S. merchants². 
7 The Youth Party was the shortened name of the Chinese Youth Party, also 
called the Étatiste Party; its predecessor was the Chinese Étatiste Youth League. 
This party was composed of a handful of fascist politicians. They made counterrevolutionary 
careers for themselves by opposing the Communist Party and the Soviet 
Union and therefore received subsidies from various groups of reactionaries in power 
and from the imperialists. 
8 The Democratic Socialist Party was formed in August 1946 through the merger 
of the Democratic Constitutional Party and the National Socialist Party. It consisted 
mainly of reactionary politicians and feudal dregs from the time of the Northern 
warlords. 
9 ³Certain so-called public personages² refers to shameless politicians like Wang 
Yun-wu, Fu Sze-nien and Hu Cheng-chih, who posed as persons with no party affiliation 
and served as a window-dressing for Chiang Kai-shek¹s ³National Assembly². 
10 On January 16, 1947, because of repeated setbacks in its military offensives 
and because of its worsening military situation, the Kuomintang government, in an

127 GREET NEW HIGH TIDE OF CHINESE REVOLUTION 
attempt to gain a respite and prepare a fresh offensive, asked the Chinese Communist 
Party, through the U.S. ambassador to China, Leighton Stuart, for permission to 
send delegates to Yenan for ³peace negotiations². This new U.S.-Chiang deception 
was promptly and thoroughly exposed by the Chinese Communist Party. 
The Chinese Communist Party pointed out that negotiations could be renewed 
only if two minimum conditions were fulfilled: (1) the bogus constitution framed 
and adopted by the Kuomintang in violation of the resolutions of the Political 
Consultative Conference had to be abolished, and (2) Kuomintang troops had to 
evacuate all the territory of the Liberated Areas they had occupied since the truce 
agreement went into effect on January 13, 1946; otherwise, there would be no guarantee 
that the Kuomintang would not again tear up any agreement reached in renewed 
negotiations. The Kuomintang government realized that the ruse of ³peace² did not 
work and on February 27 and 28 it notified all the representatives of the Chinese 
Communist Party stationed in Nanking, Shanghai and Chungking for negotiations 
and liaison that they had to leave and announced the complete breakdown of the 
negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

14 ³Evening up² was a policy adopted in the old Liberated Areas, where a 
comparatively thorough land reform had been carried out. The purpose was to 
solve the problem of insufficient land and other means of production among some 
of the poor peasants and farm labourers and other problems left over from the reform. 
The method was, on a limited scale, to take from those who had better and give to 
those who had worse, to take from those who had a surplus and give to those who 
had a shortage, so that the distribution of land and other means of production could 
be rationally readjusted.


ON THE TEMPORARY ABANDONMENT OF YENAN 
AND THE DEFENCE OF 
THE SHENSI-KANSU-NINGSIA BORDER REGION 
‹ TWO DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY 
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA* 
November 1946 and April 1947
I. DIRECTIVE OF NOVEMBER 18, 1946 
Chiang Kai-shek is at the end of his rope. He wants to strike 
at our Party and strengthen himself by two methods, by convening 
the ³National Assembly² and by attacking Yenan. Actually, he will 
accomplish the very opposite. The Chinese people resolutely oppose 
the ³National Assembly² stage-managed by Chiang Kai-shek to split 
the nation; the opening day of that assembly marked the beginning of 
the self-destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Now that we 
have wiped out thirty-five brigades1 of Chiang Kai-shek¹s troops and 
their offensive power is nearly exhausted, even if his troops should 
occupy Yenan by means of a sudden thrust, it would not damage the 
general prospect of victory in the People¹s War of Liberation, nor 
could it save Chiang Kai-shek from the doom awaiting him. In short, 
Chiang Kai-shek has taken the road to ruin; as soon as he makes these 
two moves of convening the ³National Assembly² and attacking 
Yenan, all his trickery will be exposed; this will help the progress 
of the People¹s War of Liberation. In every area we should fully 
explain to people inside and outside the Party these two actions of 
Chiang Kai-shek, the convening of the ³National Assembly² and the 
attack on Yenan, and unite the whole Party, the whole army and the 
whole people in the fight to smash Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive and 
build a democratic China. 
129

130 MAO TSE-TUNG 
II. CIRCULAR OF APRIL 9, 1947 
In order to save its moribund regime, the Kuomintang, besides 
taking such steps as convening the bogus National Assembly, drawing 
up the bogus constitution, driving out the representative agencies of 
our Party from Nanking, Shanghai and Chungking and proclaiming a 
break between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party,2 has taken 
the further step of attacking Yenan, the seat of our Party¹s Central 
Committee and the General Headquarters of the People¹s Liberation 
Army, and of attacking the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. 
The fact that the Kuomintang has taken these steps does not in 
the least indicate that its regime is strong but rather that the crisis of 
the Kuomintang regime has become extremely deep. Its attack on 
Yenan and the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region is moreover a 
vain attempt to settle the Northwest question first, cut off our Party¹s 
right arm, drive our Party¹s Central Committee and the General Headquarters 
of the People¹s Liberation Army from the Northwest, then 
move its troops to attack northern China and so achieve the objective 
of defeating our forces one by one. 
In these circumstances, the Central Committee has decided as 
follows: 
* The first of these two documents was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in 
Yenan in the winter of 1946 when Kuomintang troops were preparing to attack that 
city, and the second at Chingyangcha, Hengshan County, northern Shensi, twenty 
days after Kuomintang troops occupied Yenan on March 19, 1947. After the bankruptcy 
of Chiang Kai-shek¹s plan for an all-out offensive against the Liberated 
Areas, he adopted frantic measures to save his dying regime, convened a bogus National 
Assembly, expelled the representatives of the Communist Party of China from the 
Kuomintang areas and launched an attack on Yenan, the seat of the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China. As these documents pointed out, the outcome 
of Chiang Kai-shek¹s measures was his complete self-destruction politically. Militarily, 
he concentrated his forces on the eastern and western flanks of the Liberated Areas 
that is, the Shantung Liberated Area and the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Liberated Area 
in an attempt to carry out ³attacks against key sectors²; and again the outcome was 
complete failure. The Kuomintang troops attacking the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region were more than 230,000 strong, while the Northwest People¹s Liberation Army 
had only some 20,000 in that region. Therefore the enemy forces were able to occupy 
Yenan and all the region¹s county towns, which we abandoned on our own initiative. 
The enemy, however, failed to achieve his objective of destroying the headquarters 
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northwest 
People¹s Liberation Army or of driving them east of the Yellow River. On the contrary, 
he suffered many heavy blows from our army, lost about 100,000 men and finally 
had to flee in confusion from the Border Region, while our army triumphantly went

131 ON TEMPORARY ABANDONMENT OF YENAN 
1. We must defend and expand the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border 
Region and the Liberated Areas in the Northwest with a firm fighting 
spirit; it is entirely possible to achieve this objective. 
2. The Central Committee of our Party and the General Headquarters 
of the People¹s Liberation Army must remain in the Shensi- 
Kansu-Ningsia Border Region. It is an area where we have a favourable 
mountainous terrain, a good mass base, plenty of room for manoeuvre, 
and full guarantee for security. 
3. At the same time, to facilitate our work, we have set up a 
Working Committee of the Central Committee to proceed to northwestern 
Shansi or some other suitable place to carry out the tasks entrusted

These three decisions were made last month and have already 
been put into effect. You are hereby notified. 
over to the offensive for the liberation of the Great Northwest. Moreover, our 
army in the Northwest theatre, employing a very small force, pinned down and 
destroyed large numbers of the enemy¹s main force, and thereby strongly supported 
the operations of our troops in other theatres, particularly in the Shansi-Hopei- 
Shantung-Honan theatre, and helped them go over more quickly to the offensive. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
and the General Headquarters of the People¹s Liberation Army remained in the 
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region the whole time from March 1947, when our 
army withdrew from Yenan, to a year later when we went over to the offensive in 
the Northwest theatre. This fact was of great political significance. It greatly 
inspired and strengthened the will to fight and the confidence in victory of the army 
and the people in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and in other Liberated 
Areas throughout the country. While in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region, 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung not only continued to direct the People¹s War of Liberation 
on all fronts throughout the country but also took personal command in the Northwest 
theatre and successfully achieved the aim set forth in the present document, 
³defend and expand the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the Liberated 
Areas in the Northwest with a firm fighting spirit². Concerning the operations 
in the Northwest theatre, see ³The Concept of Operations for the Northwest War 
Theatre², pp. 133-34 and ³On the Great Victory in the Northwest and on the New 
Type of Ideological Education Movement in the Liberation Army², pp. 211-17, of 
this volume.

NOTES 
1 The statistics were for the period from early July to November 13, 1946. 
2 On February 27-28, 1947, the representatives and personnel of the Chinese 
Communist Party stationed in Nanking, Shanghai and Chungking for negotiations 
and liaison were forced by the Kuomintang government to leave within a stated time. 
On March 15, 1947, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang convened 
its third plenary session, at which Chiang Kai-shek proclaimed the Kuomintang¹s 
break with the Communist Party and his determination to fight the civil war to 
the finish.

THE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR 
THE NORTHWEST WAR THEATRE* 
April 15, 1947 
1. The enemy is now quite tired, but not yet tired out. He is 
in considerable difficulties with his food supply, but not yet in extreme 
difficulties. Although our army has not destroyed any large number 
of the enemy¹s forces since wiping out his 31st Brigade,1 in the last 
twenty days we have achieved the objective of tiring him and considerably 
reducing his food supplies, thus creating favourable conditions 
for tiring him out completely, cutting off all his food supplies and 
finally wiping him out. 
2. At present, despite the enemy¹s fatigue and shortage of food, 
his policy is to drive our main force east across the Yellow River, 
then seal off Suiteh and Michih and divide his forces for ³mopping-up² 
operations. The enemy troops reached Chingchien on March 31 b ut 
did not advance north immediately; their purpose was to leave us a 
clear passage. Their advance west towards Wayaopao was designed 
to drive us to Suiteh and Michih. Having discovered our troops, they 
are now veering to the south and west of Wayaopao and then they 
will again advance towards that town to drive us northward. 
3. Our policy is to continue our former method, that is, to keep 
the enemy on the run in this area for a time (about another month); 
the purpose is to tire him out completely, reduce his food supplies 
drastically and then look for an opportunity to destroy him. There 
is no need for our main force to hurry north to attack Yulin or south 
to cut off the enemy¹s retreat. It should be made clear to the commanders 
and fighters and also to the masses that this method of our 
army is the necessary road to the final defeat of the enemy. Unless 
we reduce the enemy to extreme fatigue and complete starvation, we 
cannot win final victory. This may be called the tactics of ³wear and 
133

134 MAO TSE-TUNG 
tear², that is, of wearing the enemy down to complete exhaustion and 
then wiping him out. 
4. As you are now in localities east and north of Wayaopao, it 
would be best to induce the enemy to move to the north of Wayaopao; 
then you may attack the weaker part of Liao Ang¹s2 forces and induce 
the enemy to move east; afterwards you may turn towards Ansai, and 
induce the enemy to move west again. 
5. But within a few days you must order the entire 359th Brigade 
to complete its preparations for a southward drive, so that a week 
from now it can be sent southward to make a surprise attack on 
the area south of the Yenchang-Yenan line and north of the Yichuan- 
Lochuan line and cut the enemy¹s food transport line. 
6. Please reply whether you consider the above views sound. 
NOTES 
1 Having withdrawn from Yenan on its own initiative, the Northwest People¹s 
Liberation Army sent out a small force to lure the enemy¹s main force as far as 
Ansai, northwest of Yenan, while leaving its main force to ambush the enemy in the 
Chinghuapien sector, northeast of Yenan. On March 25, 1947, a Kuomintang regiment 
of the 31st Brigade of Hu Tsung-nan¹s Reorganized 27th Division, led by the brigade 
headquarters, walked right into this trap and was completely destroyed in a battle 
lasting just over an hour. 
2 Liao Ang, Commander of the Reorganized 76th Division of the Kuomintang 
forces under Hu Tsung-nan, was later captured in a battle at Chingchien on October 
11, 1947. 
* This telegram was sent by Comrade Mao Tse-tung to the Northwest Field 
Army, which was then composed of the People¹s Liberation Army forces of the 
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia and Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Areas and commanded by Peng 
Teh-huai, Ho Lung, Hsi Chung-hsun and other comrades.

THE CHIANG KAI-SHEK GOVERNMENT 
IS BESIEGED 
BY THE WHOLE PEOPLE* 
May 30, 1947 
The Chiang Kai-shek government, hostile to the whole people, 
now finds itself besieged by the whole people. On both the military 
and political fronts, it has met defeats, is now besieged by the forces 
it has declared to be its enemies and can find no way of escape. 
The traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique and its master, U.S. imperialism, 
have wrongly appraised the situation. They overestimated 
their own strength and underestimated the strength of the people. 
They regarded China and the world after World War II as being the 
same as in the past; they would permit nothing to change nor anyone 
to go against their will. After Japan¹s surrender they were determined 
to restore the old order in China. And having gained time 
by such deceptions as political consultation and military mediation, 
the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government mustered two million 
troops and launched an all-out offensive. 
There are now two battle fronts in China. The war between 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s invading troops and the People¹s Liberation Army 
constitutes the first front. Now a second front has emerged, that is, 
the sharp struggle between the great and righteous student movement 
and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government.1 The slogan of 
the student movement is ³Food, Peace, Freedom² or ³Against Hunger, 
Against Civil War, Against Persecution². Chiang Kai-shek has promulgated 
the ³Provisional Measures for the Maintenance of Public 
Order².2 Everywhere his army, police, gendarmes and secret agents 
are clashing with the student masses. Chiang Kai-shek is using brute 
force against unarmed students, subjecting them to arrest, imprisonment, 
beating and slaughter; as a result the student movement is 
daily growing in strength. Public sympathy is all on the side of the 
135

136 MAO TSE-TUNG 
students, Chiang Kai-shek and his running dogs are completely isolated, 
and his ferocious features have been completely unmasked. The student 
movement is part of the whole people¹s movement. The upsurge of the 
student movement will inevitably promote an upsurge of the whole 
people¹s movement. This is borne out by the historical experience of the 
May 4th Movement of 19193 and the December 9th Movement of 1935. 
Since U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek have 
taken the place of Japanese imperialism and its running dog Wang 
Ching-wei and adopted the policies of turning China into a U.S. 
colony, launching a civil war and strengthening the fascist dictatorship, 
they have declared themselves to be enemies of the entire Chinese 
people and driven all strata of the people to the brink of starvation 
and death. This has compelled all strata of the people to unite in a 
life-and-death struggle against the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government 
and brought about the speedy development of that struggle. 
For the people there is no other way out. The strata of the Chinese 
people oppressed by the reactionary policies of the Chiang Kai-shek 
government and united for their own salvation include the workers, 
peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, enlightened 
gentry, other patriotic elements, the minority nationalities and overseas 
Chinese. This is a very broad national united front. 
The extremely reactionary financial and economic policies long 
pursued by the Chiang Kai-shek government have now been aggravated 
by the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce, the most treasonable 
treaty ever known. On the basis of this treaty, U.S. monopoly capital 
and Chiang Kai-shek¹s bureaucrat-comprador capital have become 
tightly intertwined and control the economic life of the whole country. 
The results are unbridled inflation, unparalleled soaring prices, everspreading 
bankruptcy of the industry and commerce of the national 
bourgeoisie and daily deterioration in the livelihood of the working 
masses, government employees and teachers. In these circumstances 
all strata of the people cannot but unite and fight for their very survival. 
Military suppression and political deception have been the two 
main instruments by which Chiang Kai-shek maintains his reactionary 
* This commentary was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Hsinhua 
News Agency. It pointed out that the march of events in China was faster than people 
had expected and called upon the people to prepare speedily all necessary conditions for 
the country-wide victory of the Chinese revolution. This prediction was soon confirmed. 
Both this commentary and ³The Concept of Operations for the Northwest 
War Theatre² were written at Wangchiawan, Chingpien County, northern Shensi.

137 CHIANG GOVERNMENT BESIEGED BY THE WHOLE PEOPLE 
rule. People are now witnessing the rapid collapse of both these 
instruments. 
On every battlefield Chiang Kai-shek¹s army has met with defeat. 
About ninety brigades of his regular troops alone have been wiped 
out in the eleven months since last July. His troops no longer 
display the overweening pride of last year when they occupied Changchun, 
Chengteh, Changchiakou, Hotse, Huaiyin and Antung, or even 
of this year when they occupied Linyi and Yenan. Chiang Kai-shek 
and Chen Cheng made a wrong appraisal of the strength and fighting 
methods of the People¹s Liberation Army. Mistaking our retreats 
for cowardice and our abandonment of a number of cities for defeats, 
they had fondly hoped to finish us off south of the Great Wall in 
three months or at most six, and then proceed to finish us off in the 
Northeast. But after ten months, all Chiang Kai-shek¹s invading 
troops are in desperate straits; they are completely besieged by the 
people of the Liberated Areas and the People¹s Liberation Army and 
find it very difficult to escape. 
As more and more news of the defeats of Chiang Kai-shek¹s troops 
at the front reaches his rear areas, the broad masses of the people there, 
suffocating under the oppression of his reactionary government, see 
more and more hope of ending their sufferings and winning their 
emancipation. At this very time, all Chiang Kai-shek¹s political 
tricks are failing as fast as he plays them. Everything has gone 
against the expectations of the reactionaries. Such steps as convening 
a ³National Assembly² to adopt a ³constitution², reorganizing the 
one-party government into a ³multi-party government² and what not, 
were originally aimed at isolating the Communist Party and other 
democratic forces. They have produced the opposite result; it is not 
the Communist Party or any other democratic forces that are isolated 
but the reactionaries themselves. After this the Chinese people know 
from their own experience what Chiang Kai-shek¹s ³National Assembly², 
³constitution² and ³multi-party government² really are. 
Previously, many Chinese people, mainly those of the middle strata, 
had illusions to a greater or lesser extent about these manoeuvres of 
Chiang Kai-shek. It is the same with his ³peace negotiations². Now 
that Chiang Kai-shek has torn several solemn truce agreements to 
shreds and used bayonets against the student masses demanding peace 
and opposing civil war, nobody will any longer believe in his so-called 
peace negotiations except those bent on deceiving people or those 
absolutely inexperienced politically.

All events have proved our appraisal to be correct. We have 
repeatedly pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek government is nothing 
but a government of treason, civil war and dictatorship. It seeks to 
wipe out the Chinese Communist Party and all other democratic forces 
by civil war in order to turn China into a U.S. colony and maintain its 
own dictatorial rule. Because it has adopted these reactionary policies, 
this government has lost all prestige and strength politically. 
The power of the Chiang Kai-shek government is only temporary and 
superficial; in fact, it is a government outwardly strong but inwardly 
weak. Its offensives can be smashed no matter where or on what 
fronts they are launched. Its inevitable end will be rebellion by the 
masses, desertion by its followers and the total destruction of its army. 
All events have borne out and will continue to bear out the correctness 
of this appraisal. 
The march of events in China is faster than people expected. On 
the one hand, there are the victories of the People¹s Liberation Army; 
on the other, there is the advance of the people¹s struggle in the areas 
under Chiang Kai-shek¹s control; both are moving at high speed. The 
Chinese people should quickly prepare all the necessary conditions 
for the establishment of a peaceful, democratic and independent 
new China. 
NOTES 
1 After December 1946 the democratic and patriotic movement of the broad 
masses of students in the Kuomintang areas against hunger, civil war and persecution 
gathered new momentum with the development of the People¹s War of Liberation and 
gradually became a second front in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek¹s reactionary 
rule. In late December 1946 and early January 1947, more than 500,000 students 
in scores of big and medium cities, including Peiping, Tientsin, Shanghai and Nanking, 
went on strike and held demonstrations in protest against the atrocity of the raping of a 
Peking University girl student perpetrated by U.S. soldiers and demanded the withdrawal 
of U.S. armed forces from China. This struggle won the immediate support 
of workers, teachers and other people. On May 4, 1947, students in Shanghai 
demonstrated against the civil war. At the same time eight thousand workers and 
students besieged the Kuomintang police headquarters. The patriotic movement 
soon spread to Nanking, Peiping, Hangchow, Shenyang, Tsingtao, Kaifeng and many 
other cities. The Kuomintang reactionaries resorted to extremely brutal measures 
to suppress the students¹ patriotic and democratic movement. On May 20 more than 
a hundred students were wounded and arrested in Nanking and Tientsin in the 
notorious ³Bloody Incident of May 20th². Nevertheless, the patriotic student movement, 
supported by the broad masses of the people, could not be quelled. The

139 CHIANG GOVERNMENT BESIEGED BY THE WHOLE PEOPLE 
students¹ strikes and demonstrations under the slogan, ³Against Hunger, Against 
Civil War, Against Persecution², and the people¹s anti-U.S. and anti-Chiang Kai-shek 
struggles, such as strikes of workers and teachers, spread to more than sixty large and 
medium cities. In May 1948 the students in Shanghai, together with cultural workers, 
journalists, and people from other walks of life, started a patriotic movement against 
the revival of the Japanese forces of aggression fostered by the United States, a 
movement which also spread rapidly to many other cities. The patriotic struggles 
of the students never ceased until the country-wide victory; they struck heavy blows 
at the Kuomintang. 
2 Promulgated on May 18, 1947 by the Chiang Kai-shek government, these 
measures strictly prohibited the presentation of petitions by more than ten persons 
together and forbade all strikes by workers and students and all demonstrations. 
They also authorized the Kuomintang local authorities to take ³necessary steps² and 
³emergency measures² for the sanguinary suppression of the patriotic and democratic 
movements of the people. 
3 On May 4, 1919, students in Peking demonstrated against the handing over to 
Japan of many of China¹s sovereign rights in Shantung by Britain, the United States, 
France, Japan, Italy and other imperialist countries then in conference in Paris. This 
student movement evoked an immediate response throughout the country. After 
June 3, it developed into a country-wide anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary 
movement embracing large numbers of the proletariat, the urban petty bourgeoisie 
and even the national bourgeoisie.


STRATEGY FOR THE SECOND YEAR 
OF THE WAR OF LIBERATION* 
September 1, 1947
1. In the first year¹s fighting (from July last year to June this 
year), we wiped out 97 regular brigades, or 780,000 men, and 
puppet troops, peace preservation corps and others totalling 340,000 ‹ 
altogether 1,120,000 of the enemy. This was a great victory. It dealt 
the enemy a heavy blow, created profound defeatism in the whole 
enemy camp, elated the people throughout the country and laid the 
foundation for the complete annihilation of the enemy by our army 
and for final victory. 
2. In the first year¹s fighting, the enemy launched a large-scale 
offensive against the Liberated Areas, using 218 of his 248 regular 
brigades, or more than 1,600,000 men, and nearly 1,000,000 men from 
the special arms (navy, air force, artillery, engineer corps and armoured 
units) and from the puppet troops, communications police corps and 
peace preservation corps. Our army rightly adopted the strategy of 
fighting on interior lines, and in order to hold the initiative at all times 
and places it did not balk at paying the price of over 300,000 casualties 
and of enemy occupation of large tracts of territory. Consequently, 
we succeeded in wiping out 1,120,000 enemy troops, forced the enemy 
to disperse his troops, steeled and strengthened our own forces, 
launched strategic counter-offensives in the Northeast, Jehol, eastern 
Hopei, southern Shansi and northern Honan, recovered large territories 
and liberated vast new areas.1 
3. In the second year of fighting, our army¹s basic task is to launch 
a country-wide counter-offensive, that is, to use our main forces to fight 
our way to exterior lines, carry the war into the Kuomintang areas, 
wipe out large numbers of the enemy on the exterior lines and completely 
wreck the Kuomintang¹s counter-revolutionary strategy, which 
is, on the contrary, to continue to carry the war into the Liberated 
141

142 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Areas, further damage and drain our manpower and material resources 
and make it impossible for us to hold out very long. In the 
second year¹s fighting, a partial task of our army is to use a portion 
of our main forces and large numbers of our regional troops to continue 
fighting on interior lines, wipe out the enemy there and recover lost 
territory. 
4. Our army will of course meet many difficulties in carrying out 
the policy of fighting on exterior lines and bringing the war into the 
Kuomintang areas. For it takes time to build new bases in the Kuomintang 
areas and we can build stable bases only when we have wiped 
out large numbers of the enemy in many back-and-forth mobile operations, 
aroused the masses, distributed land, established our political 
power and built up the people¹s armed forces. Until then, there will 
be quite a few difficulties. But they can and must be overcome. For 
the enemy will be forced to spread out even more, and vast territories 
will be available to our army as battlefields for mobile operations, and 
so we will be able to wage mobile warfare; the broad masses in those 
territories hate the Kuomintang and support us; and though part of 
the enemy forces still has a comparatively high combat effectiveness, 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China when he and the Central Committee 
were at Chukuanchai, Chiahsien County, northern Shensi. The directive formulated 
the basic task for the second year of the War of Liberation. This task was to carry 
the war into the Kuomintang areas with our main forces and to switch from fighting 
on interior lines to fighting on exterior lines, that is, to pass from the stage of the 
strategic defensive to that of the strategic offensive. In accordance with the strategic 
plan laid down by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the People¹s Liberation Army went over 
to the offensive on a country-wide scale during July-September 1947. The Shansi- 
Hopei-Shantung-Honan Field Army forced the Yellow River in southwestern Shantung 
on June 30, crossed the Lunghai Railway early in August and thrust into the Tapieh 
Mountains. The Taiyueh Army of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan Field Army 
forced the Yellow River from southern Shansi in late August and thrust into western 
Honan. The Eastern China Field Army thrust into southwestern Shantung early in 
September after smashing a concentrated attack by the enemy. In the same month 
the Shantung Army of the Eastern China Field Army started an offensive against the 
enemy in eastern Shantung. The Northwest Field Army went over to the offensive 
late in August. The Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Field Army started an offensive against 
the enemy along the northern section of the Peiping-Hankow Railway early in 
September. Immediately after its summer offensive throughout the Northeast, the 
Northeast Field Army, beginning in September, launched a large-scale autumn offensive 
in the Changchun-Kirin-Szepingkai region and in the Chinhsi-Ihsien sector along the 
Peiping-Liaoning Railway. The offensives in all these theatres of war constituted a 
general offensive by the entire People¹s Liberation Army. This large-scale offensive 
led to a turning point in the War of Liberation, marking a radical change in the war 
situation. See ³The Present Situation and Our Tasks², pp. 157-76 of this volume.

143 STRATEGY FOR SECOND YEAR OF LIBERATION WAR 
on the whole the enemy¹s morale and combat effectiveness are much 
lower than a year ago. 
5. The keys to victory in fighting in the Kuomintang areas are, 
first, to be good at seizing the opportunities for fighting, to be brave and 
determined and win as many battles as possible; and, second, to carry 
out resolutely the policy of winning the masses and enable the broad 
masses to benefit so that they side with our army. If these two points 
are carried out, we shall win victory. 
6. Up to the end of August this year, the distribution of enemy 
forces, including those which had been wiped out or dealt crushing 
blows, was 157 brigades on the southern front, 70 on the northern front 
and 21 in the Kuomintang rear areas. The total in the whole country 
was still 248 brigades and the actual number of troops was about 
1,500,000. Troops in the special arms, puppet troops, communications 
police and peace preservation corps numbered about 1,200,000. 
Non-combatants in the military institutions in the enemy rear were 
about 1,000,000. The entire enemy forces totalled about 3,700,000 
men. Of the troops on the southern front, 117 brigades belong to Ku 
Chu-tung¹s group, 7 to Cheng Chien¹s group and others, and 33 to 
Hu Tsung-nan¹s group. Of the 117 brigades of Ku Chu-tung¹s group, 
63 have been wiped out or have received crushing blows. Of these, 
some have not been replenished; others, although they are being replenished, 
have few men and low combat effectiveness; and others, 
although their manpower and arms have been fairly well replenished 
and their combat effectiveness has to some extent been restored, are 
still far weaker than before. There are only 54 brigades which have 
neither been wiped out nor received crushing blows. Of Ku Chutung¹s 
entire forces, 82 to 85 brigades are employed for garrison 
duty and can be used only for local manoeuvres, and no more than 
32 to 35 brigades can be used for strategic manoeuvres. The 7 brigades 
of Cheng Chien¹s group and others can in the main be used 
only for garrison duty, and one has already received a crushing blow. 
Of the 33 brigades of Hu Tsung-nan¹s group (including those east 
of Lanchow, south of Ningsia and Yulin, and west of Linfen and 
Loyang), 12 have been wiped out or received crushing blows, only 7 
can be used for strategic manoeuvres, and the rest are on garrison 
duty. On the northern front the enemy has 70 brigades altogether. 
Of these, the Northeast group has 26 brigades, of which 16 have been 
wiped out or have received crushing blows; Sun Lien-chung¹s group 
has 19 brigades, of which 8 have been wiped out or received crushing

144 MAO TSE-TUNG 
blows; Fu Tso-yi has 10 brigades, of which 2 have received crushing 
blows; and Yen Hsi-shan has 15 brigades, of which 9 have been wiped 
out or received crushing blows. These enemy troops are now mainly 
on the defensive and only a small part is available for mobile operations. 
In the Kuomintang rear areas there are only 21 brigades on 
garrison duty. Of these, 8 brigades are in Sinkiang and western 
Kansu, 7 in Szechuan and Sikang, 2 in Yunnan, 2 in Kwangtung (that 
is, the 69th Division that was wiped out) and 2 in Taiwan. There 
are no regular troops at all in the six provinces of Hunan, Kwangsi, 
Kweichow, Fukien, Chekiang and Kiangsi. The Kuomintang is planning, 
with U.S. assistance, to draft 1,000,000 men this year to replenish 
the front and to train a number of new brigades and replacement 
regiments. However, if our army can wipe out an average of 8 enemy 
brigades a month, as it did in the first year of fighting, and wipe out 
another 96 to 100 brigades in the second year (already in July and 
August 16 brigades were wiped out), then the enemy army will be 
further and greatly weakened, its strategic reserve will be reduced to 
the minimum, and it will be forced into a defensive position in all 
parts of the country and will be attacked by us everywhere. Although 
the Kuomintang has this plan of drafting 1,000,000 men and training 
new brigades and replacement regiments, it will be of no avail. Since 
its only methods of recruiting are pressganging and hiring, to reach a 
million will certainly be difficult and many will desert. Moreover, by 
carrying out the policy of fighting on exterior lines our army will be 
able to reduce the enemy¹s manpower and material resources. 
7. The operational principles of our army are still the same as 
those laid down before: 
Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first (this applies also 
to a large-scale campaign of annihilation directed against several 
brigades, such as the Laiwu campaign2 in February and the Southwestern 
Shantung campaign3 in July this year); attack concentrated, 
strong enemy forces later. 
Take medium and small cities and extensive rural areas first; 
take big cities later. 
Make wiping out the enemy¹s effective strength our main objective; 
do not make holding or seizing a place our main objective. 
Holding or seizing a place is the outcome of wiping out the enemy¹s 
effective strength, and often a place can be held or seized for good 
only after it has changed hands a number of times.

145 STRATEGY FOR SECOND YEAR OF LIBERATION WAR 
In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force, 
encircle the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them out 
thoroughly and do not let any escape from the net. In special circumstances, 
use the method of dealing crushing blows to the enemy, 
that is, concentrate all our strength to make a frontal attack and 
also to attack one or both of his flanks, with the aim of wiping out 
one part and routing another so that our army can swiftly move its 
troops to smash other enemy forces. 
On the one hand, be sure to fight no battle unprepared, fight 
no battle you are not sure of winning; make every effort to be well 
prepared for each battle, make every effort to ensure victory in the 
given set of conditions as between the enemy and ourselves. On 
the other hand, give full play to our fine style of fighting ‹ courage 
in battle, no fear of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous 
fighting (that is, fighting successive battles in a short time). 
Strive to draw the enemy into mobile warfare, but at the same 
time lay great stress on learning the tactics of positional attack 
and on stepping up the building of the artillery and engineer corps 
in order to capture enemy fortified points and cities on a large scale. 
Resolutely attack and seize all fortified points and cities which 
are weakly defended. Attack and seize at opportune moments all 
fortified points and cities defended with moderate strength, provided 
circumstances permit. For the time being, leave alone all 
fortified points and cities which are strongly defended. 
Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the 
soldiers captured from the enemy (80-90 per cent of the men and a 
small number of the junior officers). Seek replenishment chiefly 
from the enemy and from the Kuomintang areas and only partly 
from the old Liberated Areas; this applies especially to the armies 
on the southern front. 
In all the new and old Liberated Areas, we must resolutely carry 
through the land reform (which is the most fundamental requirement 
for supporting a long war and winning country-wide victory), develop 
production, practise economy and strengthen the building of war 
industry ‹ all for victory at the front. Only by doing this can we 
support a long war and win victory in the whole country. If we do 
so, we shall certainly be able to support a long war and win victory 
throughout the country. 
8. The above sums up the year¹s fighting and sets forth the principles 
for future fighting. Leading comrades in all areas are requested

NOTES 
1 This strategic counter-offensive in the Northeast, Jehol and eastern Hopei was 
the 1947 summer offensive of the Northeast People¹s Liberation Army. On May 13 
the People¹s Liberation Army began simultaneous offensives on these fronts and by 
July 1 had wiped out over 80,000 enemy troops and recovered more than 40 county 
towns. The enemy plan of cutting up the Liberated Areas in northeastern China 
was thus completely wrecked. The enemy troops, driven into two narrow corridors 
along the Chinese Changchun Railway and the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, were forced 
into the ³defence of key points². This changed the whole situation in northeastern 
China. The strategic counter-offensive in southern Shansi and northern Honan 
comprised the offensives launched by the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan People¹s 
Liberation Army in northern Honan and on the flanks of the Tatung-Puchow Railway 
in southern Shansi between March and May 1947. Our army in northern Honan 
started attacking on March 23. After taking Yenchin, Yangwu, Puyang and Fengchiu 
one after another, our army turned north to exploit these successes. By May 28 it had 
captured Tsihsien, Chunhsien, Huahsien and Tangyin and wiped out over 45,000 
enemy troops. Our troops in southern Shansi began offensive operations on April 4. 
By May 4 they had captured twenty-two county towns, including Chuwo, Hsinchiang 
and Yungtsi, and two important ferry crossings on the Yellow River, Yumenkou 
and Fenglingtu, and had wiped out over 18,000 enemy troops. 
2 The Laiwu campaign was a campaign of mobile warfare fought by the Eastern 
China People¹s Liberation Army in the Laiwu region, southeast of Tsinan, Shantung 
Province. Towards the end of January 1947 the Kuomintang troops launched an 
offensive against the Shantung Liberated Areas from both the north and the south. 
From the south, eight Kuomintang reorganized divisions drove northward by three 
routes along the Yiho and Shuho Rivers towards Linyi and from the north, in coordination 
with them, three Kuomintang corps belonging to the Li Hsien-chou group 
advanced southward on Laiwu and Hsintai from Mingshui, Tsechuan and Poshan, 
seeking to engage the main force of the Eastern China People¹s Liberation Army in a 
decisive battle in the Yi-Meng mountain area. Our army used part of its forces 
to block the enemy from the south but marched its main force north towards Laiwu 
to destroy the Li Hsien-chou group. All the enemy troops, over 60,000 men, were 
wiped out in a battle which started on February 20 and ended on the afternoon 
of February 23. Li Hsien-chou, Deputy Commander of the 2nd Pacification Zone of 
the Kuomintang¹s Hsuchow Pacification Headquarters, was captured, and thirteen 
towns were recovered. 
3 This Southwestern Shantung campaign was the campaign fought by the Shansi- 
Hopei-Shantung-Honan People¹s Liberation Army in July 1947 in the region of Hotse, 
Yuncheng, Chuyeh, Tingtao, Chinhsiang and Tsaohsien, in southwestern Shantung 
Province. In this campaign 4 Kuomintang division headquarters and 9 brigades 
totalling more than 56,000 men, were wiped out.

MANIFESTO OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE¹S 
LIBERATION ARMY* 
October 1947 
The Chinese People¹s Liberation Army, having smashed Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s offensive, has now launched a large-scale counter-offensive. 
Our armies on the southern front are advancing on the Yangtse River 
valley, our armies on the northern front are advancing on the Chinese 
Changchun Railway and the Peiping-Liaoning Railway. Wherever 
our troops go, the enemy flees pell-mell before us and the people give 
thunderous cheers. The whole situation between the enemy and ourselves 
has fundamentally changed as compared with a year ago. 
The aim of our army in this war, as proclaimed time and again to 
the nation and the world, is the liberation of the Chinese people and 
the Chinese nation. And today, our aim is to carry out the urgent 
demand of the people of the whole country, that is, to overthrow the 
arch-criminal of the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek, and form a democratic 
coalition government in order to attain the general goal of liberating 
the people and the nation. 
For eight long years the Chinese people fought heroically against 
Japanese imperialism for their own liberation and national independence. 
After the Japanese surrender the people longed for peace, but 
Chiang Kai-shek wrecked all their peace efforts and forced on them 
the disaster of an unprecedented civil war. Hence the people of all 
strata throughout the country were forced to unite to overthrow Chiang 
Kai-shek, having no other way out. 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s present policy of civil war is no accident but is 
the inevitable outcome of the anti-popular policy which he and his 
reactionary clique have consistently followed. As far back as 1927, 
Chiang Kai-shek, devoid of all gratitude, betrayed the revolutionary 
alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party1 and 
betrayed the revolutionary Three People¹s Principles and the Three 
147

148 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Great Policies of Sun Yat-sen,2 then he set up a dictatorship, capitulated 
to imperialism, fought ten years of civil war and brought on 
the aggression of the Japanese bandits. In the Sian Incident of 1936, 
the Communist Party of China returned good for evil and, acting 
together with Generals Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng, set 
Chiang Kai-shek free in the hope that he would repent, turn over a 
new leaf and join in the fight against the Japanese aggressors. But 
once again he proved devoid of all gratitude; he was passive against 
the Japanese invaders, active in suppressing the people and extremely 
hostile to the Communist Party. The year before last (1945), Japan 
surrendered and the Chinese people once more forgave Chiang Kaishek, 
demanding that he should stop the civil war he had already 
started, put democracy into practice and unite with all parties and 
groups for peace and national reconstruction. But no sooner had the 
truce agreement been signed, the resolutions of the Political Consultative 
Conference adopted and the four pledges3 proclaimed than the 
utterly faithless Chiang Kai-shek went back on his word completely. 
Time and again the people showed themselves forbearing and conciliatory 
for the sake of the common good but, aided by U.S. imperialism, 
Chiang Kai-shek was determined to launch an unprecedented all-out 
offensive against the people, in utter disregard of the fate of the 
country and the nation. From January last year (1946), when the 
truce agreement was announced, up to the present, Chiang Kai-shek 
has mobilized more than 220 brigades of his regular troops and nearly 
a million miscellaneous troops4 and launched large-scale attacks against 
the Liberated Areas which the Chinese people wrested from Japanese 
imperialism after bloody battles; he has seized successively the cities 
of Shenyang, Fushun, Penki, Szepingkai, Changchun, Yungchi, Chengteh, 
Chining, Changchiakou, Huaiyin, Hotse, Linyi, Yenan and Yentai 
and vast rural areas. Wherever Chiang Kai-shek¹s troops go, they 
murder and burn, rape and loot, carry out the policy of three atrocities5 
and behave exactly like the Japanese bandits. In November last 
year Chiang Kai-shek convened the bogus National Assembly and 
proclaimed the bogus constitution. In March this year he expelled the 
* This political manifesto was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the General 
Headquarters of the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army. It analysed the political 
situation in China at the time, raised the slogan ³Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and 
liberate all China!² and announced the eight basic policies of the Chinese People¹s 
Liberation Army, which were also those of the Communist Party of China. The 
manifesto was issued on October 10, 1947, and was known as the ³October 10th 
Manifesto². It was drafted at Shenchuanpao, Chiahsien County, northern Shensi.

149 MANIFESTO OF CHINESE PEOPLE¹S LIBERATION ARMY 
representatives of the Communist Party from the Kuomintang areas. 
In July he issued an order of general mobilization against the people.6 
Towards the just movement of the people in different parts of the 
country against civil war, against hunger and against U.S. imperialist 
aggression and towards the struggle for existence waged by the 
workers, peasants, students, townspeople, government employees and 
teachers, Chiang Kai-shek¹s policy is one of repression, arrest and 
massacre. Towards our country¹s minority nationalities, his policy is 
one of Han chauvinism, of persecution and repression by every possible 
means. In all the areas under Chiang Kai-shek¹s rule corruption 
is rife, secret agents run amuck, taxes are innumerable and crushing, 
prices are skyrocketing, the economy is bankrupt, all business languishes, 
conscription and the grain levy are imposed and voices of discontent 
are heard everywhere; all this has plunged the overwhelming 
majority of people throughout the country into an abyss of suffering. 
Meanwhile the financial oligarchs, corrupt officials, local bullies and 
bad gentry, all headed by Chiang Kai-shek, have amassed vast fortunes. 
Chiang Kai-shek and his like made these fortunes by using their dictatorial 
powers to extort taxes and levies and promote their private 
interests under the guise of serving the public. To maintain his 
dictatorship and carry on the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has not 
hesitated to sell out our country¹s sovereign rights to foreign imperialism, 
to collude with the U.S. armed forces so that they should remain 
in Tsingtao and elsewhere and to procure advisers from the United 
States to take part in directing the civil war and training troops to 
slaughter his own fellow-countrymen. Aircraft, tanks, guns and ammunition 
for the civil war are shipped from the United States in great 
quantities. Funds for the civil war are borrowed from the United 
States on a large scale. In return for its favours, Chiang Kai-shek 
has presented U.S. imperialism with military bases and the rights of 
air flight and navigation and concluded with it a commercial treaty 
of enslavement7 ‹ acts of treason many times worse than those of 
Yuan Shih-kai.8 In a word, Chiang Kai-shek¹s twenty-year rule has 
been traitorous, dictatorial and against the people. Today, the overwhelming 
majority of the people throughout the country, north and 
south, young and old, know his towering crimes and hope that our 
army will quickly launch the counter-offensive, overthrow Chiang 
Kai-shek and liberate all China. 
We are the army of the Chinese people and in all things we take 
the will of the Chinese people as our will. The policies of our army

150 MAO TSE-TUNG 
represent the urgent demands of the Chinese people and chief among 
them are the following: 
(1) Unite workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals and businessmen, 
all oppressed classes, all people¹s organizations, democratic 
parties, minority nationalities, overseas Chinese and other patriots; 
form a national united front; overthrow the dictatorial Chiang Kaishek 
government; and establish a democratic coalition government. 
(2) Arrest, try and punish the civil war criminals headed by 
Chiang Kai-shek. 
(3) Abolish the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship, carry out the system 
of people¹s democracy and guarantee freedom of speech, of the 
press, of assembly and of association for the people. 
(4) Abolish the rotten institutions of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, 
clear out all corrupt officials and establish clean government. 
(5) Confiscate the property of the four big families9 of Chiang 
Kai-shek, T. V. Soong, H. H. Kung and the Chen Li-fu brothers, and 
the property of the other chief war criminals; confiscate bureaucratcapital, 
develop the industry and commerce of the national bourgeoisie, 
improve the livelihood of workers and employees, and give relief 
to victims of natural calamities and to poverty-stricken people. 
(6) Abolish the system of feudal exploitation and put into effect 
the system of land to the tillers. 
(7) Recognize the right to equality and autonomy of the minority 
nationalities within the borders of China. 
(8) Repudiate the traitorous foreign policy of Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
dictatorial government, abrogate all the treasonable treaties and repudiate 
all the foreign debts contracted by Chiang Kai-shek during the 
civil war period. Demand that the U.S. government withdraw its 
troops stationed in China, which are a menace to China¹s independence, 
and oppose any foreign country¹s helping Chiang Kai-shek to 
carry on civil war or trying to revive the forces of Japanese aggression. 
Conclude treaties of trade and friendship with foreign countries on 
the basis of equality and reciprocity. Unite in a common struggle 
with all nations which treat us as equals. 
The above are the basic policies of our army. They will be put 
into practice at once wherever our army goes. These policies conform 
with the demands of more than go per cent of the people in 
our country. 
Our army does not reject all Chiang Kai-shek¹s personnel but 
adopts a policy of dealing with each case on its merits. That is, the

151 MANIFESTO OF CHINESE PEOPLE¹S LIBERATION ARMY 
chief criminals shall be punished without fail, those who are accomplices 
under duress shall go unpunished and those who perform 
deeds of merit shall be rewarded. As for Chiang Kai-shek, the archcriminal 
who started the civil war and who has committed most 
heinous crimes, and as for all his hardened accomplices who have 
trampled the people underfoot and are branded as war criminals by 
the broad masses, our army will hunt them down, even to the four 
corners of the earth, and will surely bring them to trial and punishment. 
Our army warns all officers and men in Chiang Kai-shek¹s army, all 
officials in his government and all members of his party whose hands 
are not yet stained with the blood of innocent people that they should 
strictly refrain from joining these criminals in their evil-doing. Those 
who have been doing evil should immediately stop, repent and start 
anew and break with Chiang Kai-shek, and we will give them a chance 
to make amends for their crimes by good deeds. Our army will not 
kill or humiliate any of Chiang Kai-shek¹s army officers and men who 
lay down their arms, but will accept them into our service if they are 
willing to remain with us or send them home if they wish to leave. As 
for those troops of Chiang Kai-shek who rise in revolt and join our 
army and those who work for our army openly or in secret, they shall 
be rewarded. 
In order to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and form a democratic 
coalition government at an early date, we call on our fellow-countrymen 
in all walks of life to co-operate actively with us wherever our army 
goes in cleaning up the reactionary forces and setting up a democratic 
order. In places we have not yet reached, they should take up arms 
on their own, resist pressganging and the grain levy, distribute the 
land, repudiate debts and take advantage of the enemy¹s gaps to 
develop guerrilla warfare. 
In order to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and form a democratic 
coalition government at an early date, we call on the people in the 
Liberated Areas to carry through the land reform, consolidate the 
foundations of democracy, develop production, practise economy, 
strengthen the people¹s armed forces, eliminate the remaining strongholds 
of the enemy and support the fighting at the front. 
All comrade commanders and fighters of our army! We are 
shouldering the most important, the most glorious task in the history 
of our country¹s revolution. We should make great efforts to accomplish 
our task. Our efforts will decide the day when our great 
motherland will emerge from darkness into light and our beloved

152 MAO TSE-TUNG 
fellow-countrymen will be able to live like human beings and to 
choose the government they wish. All officers and fighters of our 
army must improve their military art, march forward courageously towards 
sure victory in the war and resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and 
completely wipe out all enemies. They must all raise their level of 
political consciousness, learn the two skills of wiping out the enemy 
forces and arousing the masses, unite intimately with the masses and 
rapidly build the new Liberated Areas into stable areas. They must 
heighten their sense of discipline and resolutely carry out orders, carry 
out policy, carry out the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the 
Eight Points for Attention ‹ with army and people united, army and 
government united, officers and soldiers united, and the whole army 
united-and permit no breach of discipline. All our officers and 
fighters must always bear in mind that we are the great People¹s Liberation 
Army, we are the troops led by the great Communist Party of 
China. Provided we constantly observe the directives of the Party, 
we are sure to win. 
Down with Chiang Kai-shek! 
Long live New China!

Ching Dynasty. After the Ching Dynasty was overthrown by the Revolution of 1911, 
he usurped the presidency of the Republic and organized the first government of the 
Northern warlords, which represented the big landlord and big comprador classes; he 
did this by relying on a counter-revolutionary armed force and the support of the 
imperialists and by taking advantage of the compromising nature of the bourgeoisie 
then leading the revolution. In 1915 he wanted to make himself emperor and, to 
gain the support of the Japanese imperialists, he accepted Japan¹s Twenty-one 
Demands which were designed to obtain exclusive control of all China. In December 
of the same year an uprising against his assumption of the throne took place in 
Yunnan Province and promptly won country-wide response and support. Yuan

ON THE REISSUE OF 
THE THREE MAIN RULES OF DISCIPLINE AND 
THE EIGHT POINTS FOR ATTENTION 
‹ INSTRUCTION OF 
THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS OF 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE¹S LIBERATION ARMY 
October 10, 1947
1. Our Army¹s Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points 
for Attention1 have been practised for many years, but their contents 
vary slightly in army units in different areas. They have now been 
unified and are hereby reissued. It is expected that you will take 
this version as the standard one for thorough education and strict 
enforcement. As to other matters needing attention, the high 
command of the armed forces in different areas may lay down additional 
points in accordance with specific conditions and order their 
enforcement. 
2. The Three Main Rules of Discipline are as follows: 
(1) Obey orders in all your actions. 
(2) Don¹t take a single needle or piece of thread from the 
masses. 
(3) Turn in everything captured. 
3. The Eight Points for Attention are as follows: 
(1) Speak politely. 
(2) Pay fairly for what you buy. 
(3) Return everything you borrow. 
(4) Pay for anything you damage. 
(5) Don¹t hit or swear at people. 
(6) Don¹t damage crops. 
(7) Don¹t take liberties with women. 
(8) Don¹t ill-treat captives.

NOTES 
1 The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention were 
the rules of discipline laid down by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Chinese Workers¹ 
and Peasants¹ Red Army during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. They formed 
an important part of the political work of the Red Army and played a great role in 
building the people¹s armed forces, handling relations within the army correctly, 
forging unity with the masses of the people and laying down the correct policy of the 
people¹s army towards captives. From the earliest days of the Red Army, Comrade 
Mao Tse-tung required the soldiers to speak politely to the masses, pay 
fairly for all purchases and never impress people into forced labour or hit or swear 
at people. In the spring of 1928, when the Workers¹ and Peasants¹ Red Army was 
in the Chingkang Mountains, Comrade Mao Tse-tung set down Three Rules of 
Discipline: (1) Obey orders in your actions; (2) Don¹t take anything from the 
workers and peasants; and (3) Turn in all things taken from local bullies. In the 
summer of 1928 he set forth Six Points for Attention: (1) Put back the doors you 
have taken down for bed-boards; (2) Put back the straw you have used for bedding; 
(3) Speak politely; (4) Pay fairly for what you buy; (5) Return everything you 
borrow; and (6) Pay for anything you damage. After 1929 Comrade Mao Tse-tung 
made the following changes: Rule 2 became ³Don¹t take a single needle or piece 
of thread from the masses², and Rule 3 was changed first to ³Turn in all money 
raised² and then to ³Turn in everything captured². To the Six Points for Attention 
he added two more: ³Don¹t bathe within sight of women² and ³Don¹t search 
the pockets of captives². This was the origin of the Three Main Rules of Discipline 
and the Eight Points for Attention.

THE PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS* 
December 25, 1947
I 
The Chinese people¹s revolutionary war has now reached a turning 
point. That is, the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army has beaten 
back the offensive of several million reactionary troops of Chiang 
Kai-shek, the running dog of the United States of America, and gone 
over to the offensive. Already in the first year of the present war, 
from July 1946 to June 1947, the People¹s Liberation Army beat back 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive on several fronts and forced him onto the 
defensive. And beginning with the first quarter of the second year 
of the war, July-September 1947, the People¹s Liberation Army went 
over to the offensive on a national scale and wrecked Chiang Kaishek¹s 
counter-revolutionary plan of continuing to carry the war into 
the Liberated Areas in order to destroy them completely. Now the war 
is no longer being fought chiefly in the Liberated Areas but in the Kuomintang 
areas; the main forces of the People¹s Liberation Army have 
carried the fight into the Kuomintang areas.1 In this land of China, the 
People¹s Liberation Army has turned back the wheel of counterrevolution 
‹ of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek 
bandit gang ‹ and sent it down the road to destruction and has pushed 
the wheel of revolution forward along the road to victory. This is a 
turning point in history. It is the turning point from growth to extinction 
for Chiang Kai-shek¹s twenty-year counter-revolutionary rule. It 
is the turning point from growth to extinction for imperialist rule in 
China, now over a hundred years old. This is a momentous event. 
It is momentous because it is occurring in a country with a population 
of 475 million and, having occurred, it will certainly culminate in victory 
throughout the country. Furthermore, it is momentous because 
it is occurring in the East, where over 1,000 million people ‹ half of 
157

158 MAO TSE-TUNG 
mankind ‹ suffer under imperialist oppression. The turn of the Chinese 
People¹s War of Liberation from the defensive to the offensive 
cannot but gladden and inspire these oppressed nations. It is also 
of assistance to the oppressed people now struggling in many countries 
in Europe and the Americas. 
II 
From the day Chiang Kai-shek started his counter-revolutionary 
war we said that we not only must defeat him but can defeat him. 
We must defeat him because the war he started is a counterrevolutionary 
war directed by U.S. imperialism against the independence 
of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the Chinese people. 
After the conclusion of World War II and the overthrow of Japanese 
imperialism, the task of the Chinese people was to complete the newdemocratic 
transformation politically, economically and culturally, to 
achieve national unification and independence and to change China 
from an agricultural into an industrial country. But at that time, after 
the victorious conclusion of the anti-fascist Second World War, U.S. 
imperialism and its lackeys in various countries stepped into the shoes 
of German and Japanese imperialism and their lackeys and formed a 
reactionary camp against the Soviet Union, against the People¹s Democracies 
in Europe, against the workers¹ movements in the capitalist 
* This report was made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung to a meeting of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China held on December 25-28, 1947, at Yangchiakou, 
Michih County, northern Shensi. In addition to those members and alternate 
members of the Central Committee able to attend, responsible comrades of the 
Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the Shansi-Suiyuan Border Region were 
present. The meeting discussed and adopted this report and also another document 
written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, ³Some Points in Appraisal of the Present International 
Situation² (see pp. 87-88 of this volume). Concerning Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s 
report, the decision adopted at the meeting stated, ³This report is a programmatic 
document in the political, military and economic fields for the entire period of the 
overthrow of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique and of the founding of 
a new-democratic China. The whole Party and the whole army should carry on 
intensive education around, and strictly apply in practice, this document and, in connection 
with it, the documents published on October 10, 1947 [namely, ŒManifesto of 
the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army¹, ŒSlogans of the Chinese People¹s Liberation 
Army¹, ŒInstruction on the Reissue of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the 
Eight Points for Attention¹, ŒOutline Land Law of China¹ and ŒResolution of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Promulgation of the

159 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
countries, against the national movements in the colonies and semicolonies 
and against the liberation of the Chinese people. At such a 
time the Chinese reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek acted as 
the running dog for U.S. imperialism, just as Wang Ching-wei had 
done for Japanese imperialism, sold out China to the United States 
and unleashed a war against the Chinese people to check the advance 
of their liberation. At such a time, if we had shown weakness or given 
ground and had not dared to rise resolutely to oppose counterrevolutionary 
war with revolutionary war, China would have become a 
world of darkness and the future of our nation would have been forfeited. 
The Communist Party of China has led the Chinese People¹s 
Liberation Army in firmly waging a patriotic, just and revolutionary 
war against Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive. The Communist Party of 
China, having made a clear-headed appraisal of the international and 
domestic situation on the basis of the science of Marxism-Leninism, 
recognized that all attacks by the reactionaries at home and abroad not 
only had to be defeated but could be defeated. When dark clouds appeared 
in the sky, we pointed out that this was only temporary, that 
the darkness would soon pass and the sun break through. When the 
Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched the country-wide counterrevolutionary 
war in July 1946, they thought it would take them only 
three to six months to defeat the People¹s Liberation Army. They 
reckoned that they had a regular army of two million, more than a million 
irregulars and another million or more men in the military establishments 
and armed units in the rear, making a total military strength 
Outline Land Law of China¹]. In carrying out policies in different places any 
departure from the principles laid down in the report should be rectified at once.² 
Other important decisions taken at the meeting were: 
(1) That every effort should be made to carry the Chinese people¹s revolutionary 
war forward uninterruptedly to complete victory, and that the enemy 
should not be allowed to use stalling tactics (peace negotiations) to gain time for 
rest and reorganization for a fresh attack on the people. 
(2) That the time was not yet ripe for the formation of a revolutionary 
central government, which was to be considered only when our army had won 
greater victories, and that the promulgation of a constitution was even more 
a question for the future. 
The meeting also discussed in detail current tendencies in the Party and certain 
specific policies in the land reform and the mass movements. The results of these 
discussions were subsequently set forth by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in the article ³On 
Some Important Problems of the Party¹s Present Policy² (see pp. 181-89 of this volume).

had taken over all the equipment of a million Japanese invading troops; 
and that they had received huge military and financial aid from the 
U.S. government. They also reckoned that the People¹s Liberation 
Army was tired after fighting for eight years in the War of Resistance 
Against Japan and was far inferior to the Kuomintang army in numbers 
and equipment; that the population of the Liberated Areas was 
only a little more than 100 million; and that in most of these areas the 
reactionary feudal forces had not yet been cleaned up and the land 
reform had not yet been universally and thoroughly carried out, 
namely, that the rear area of the People¹s Liberation Army had not yet 
been consolidated. Proceeding from this appraisal, the Chiang Kaishek 
bandit gang ignored the Chinese people¹s desire for peace, finally 
tore up the truce agreement signed by the Kuomintang and the Communist 
Party in January 1946 as well as the resolutions adopted by 
the Political Consultative Conference of all parties and launched an 
adventurist war. We said then that Chiang Kai-shek¹s superiority in 
military forces was only transient, a factor which could play only a 
temporary role, that U.S. imperialist aid was likewise a factor which 
could play only a temporary role, while the anti-popular character of 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s war and the feelings of the people were factors 
that would play a constant role, and that in this respect the People¹s 
Liberation Army was in a superior position. Patriotic, just and revolutionary 
in character, the war waged by the People¹s Liberation 
Army was bound to win the support of the people of the whole country. 
That was the political foundation for victory over Chiang Kai-shek. 
The experience of eighteen months of war has fully confirmed our 
judgement. 
III 
In seventeen months of fighting (from July 1946 to November 1947; 
December figures are not yet available), we killed, wounded and captured 
1,690,000 of Chiang Kai-shek¹s regular and irregular troops ‹ 
640,000 killed and wounded and 1,050,000 captured. Thus we were 
able to beat back Chiang Kai-shek¹s offensive, preserve the main territories 
of the Liberated Areas and go over to the offensive. Speaking

161 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
from the military aspect, we were able to do this because we employed 
the correct strategy. Our principles of operation are: 
1. Attack dispersed, isolated enemy forces first; attack concentrated, 
strong enemy forces later. 
2. Take small and medium cities and extensive rural areas 
first; take big cities later. 
3. Make wiping out the enemy¹s effective strength our main 
objective; do not make holding or seizing a city or place our main 
objective. Holding or seizing a city or place is the outcome of 
wiping out the enemy¹s effective strength, and often a city or place 
can be held or seized for good only after it has changed hands a 
number of times. 
4. In every battle, concentrate an absolutely superior force 
(two, three, four and sometimes even five or six times the enemy¹s 
strength), encircle the enemy forces completely, strive to wipe them 
out thoroughly and do not let any escape from the net. In special 
circumstances, use the method of dealing crushing blows to the 
enemy, that is, concentrate all our strength to make a frontal attack 
and also to attack one or both of his flanks, with the aim of wiping 
out one part and routing another so that our army can swiftly move 
its troops to smash other enemy forces. Strive to avoid battles of 
attrition in which we lose more than we gain or only break even. In 
this way, although we are inferior as a whole (in terms of numbers), 
we are absolutely superior in every part and every specific campaign, 
and this ensures victory in the campaign. As time goes on, we shall 
become superior as a whole and eventually wipe out all the enemy. 
5. Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure 
of winning; make every effort to be well prepared for each battle, 
make every effort to ensure victory in the given set of conditions 
as between the enemy and ourselves. 
6. Give full play to our style of fighting ‹ courage in battle, 
no fear of sacrifice, no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting 
(that is, fighting successive battles in a short time without rest). 
7. Strive to wipe out the enemy through mobile warfare. At 
the same time, pay attention to the tactics of positional attack and 
capture enemy fortified points and cities. 
8. With regard to attacking cities, resolutely seize all enemy 
fortified points and cities which are weakly defended. Seize at 
opportune moments all enemy fortified points and cities defended

162 MAO TSE-TUNG 
with moderate strength, provided circumstances permit. As for 
strongly defended enemy fortified points and cities, wait till conditions 
are ripe and then take them. 
9. Replenish our strength with all the arms and most of the 
personnel captured from the enemy. Our army¹s main sources of 
manpower and materiel are at the front. 
10. Make good use of the intervals between campaigns to rest, 
train and consolidate our troops. Periods of rest, training and 
consolidation should in general not be very long, and the enemy 
should so far as possible be permitted no breathing space. 
These are the main methods the People¹s Liberation Army has employed 
in defeating Chiang Kai-shek. They are the result of the 
tempering of the People¹s Liberation Army in long years of fighting 
against domestic and foreign enemies and are completely suited to our 
present situation. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the U.S. 
imperialist military personnel in China are very well acquainted with 
these military methods of ours. Seeking ways to counter them, Chiang 
Kai-shek has often assembled his generals and field officers for training 
and distributed for their study our military literature and the documents 
captured in the war. The U.S. military personnel have recommended 
to Chiang Kai-shek one kind of strategy and tactics after 
another for destroying the People¹s Liberation Army; they have trained 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s troops and supplied them with military equipment. 
But none of these efforts can save the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang 
from defeat. The reason is that our strategy and tactics are based on a 
people¹s war; no army opposed to the people can use our strategy and 
tactics. On the basis of a people¹s war and of the principles of unity 
between army and people, of unity between commanders and fighters 
and of disintegrating the enemy troops, the People¹s Liberation Army 
has developed its vigorous revolutionary political work, which is 
an important factor in winning victory over the enemy. When we 
abandoned many cities on our own initiative in order to evade fatal 
blows from superior enemy forces and shift our forces to destroy the 
enemy in mobile warfare, our enemies were jubilant. They took 
this to be their victory and our defeat. They became dizzy with this 
momentary ³victory². On the afternoon of the day he seized Changchiakou, 
Chiang Kai-shek ordered the convening of his reactionary 
National Assembly, as though his reactionary regime had from that 
moment become as stable as Mount Taishan. The U.S. imperialists,

163 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
too, danced with joy, as though their wild scheme for converting China 
into a U.S. colony could now be realized without obstruction. But 
with the lapse of time, Chiang Kai-shek and his U.S. masters 
began to change their tune. Now all our enemies, domestic and foreign, 
are gripped by pessimism. They heave great sighs, wail about 
a crisis and no longer show any sign of joy. In the past eighteen 
months, most of Chiang Kai-shek¹s high-ranking field commanders 
have been replaced for losing battles. Among them are Liu Chih 
(Chengchow), Hsueh Yueh (Hsuchow), Wu Chi-wei (northern Kiangsu), 
Tang En-po (southern Shantung), Wang Chung-lien (northern 
Honan), Tu Yu-ming and Hsiung Shih-hui (Shenyang) and Sun 
Lien-chung (Peiping). Chen Cheng, too, was relieved of his post as 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s chief of staff in over-all command of operations and 
demoted to command a single front in the Northeast.2 However, it 
was in the very period when Chiang Kai-shek himself assumed overall 
command in Chen Cheng¹s place that the situation changed and that 
his armies shifted from the offensive to the defensive, while the People¹s 
Liberation Army went over from the defensive to the offensive. 
By now the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique and its U.S. masters 
should have realized their mistake. They had regarded as signs of 
cowardice and weakness all the efforts for peace and against civil war 
which the Communist Party of China, representing the wishes of the 
Chinese people, had made over a long period after the surrender of 
Japan. They had overestimated their own strength, underestimated 
the strength of the revolution and rashly unleashed the war and so were 
caught in their own trap. Our enemy¹s strategic calculations failed 
completely. 
IV 
The rear areas of the People¹s Liberation Army are much more 
consolidated now than eighteen months ago. The reason is that our 
Party, standing resolutely on the side of the peasants, has carried out 
the land reform. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our 
Party, on its own initiative and for the sake of forming an anti-Japanese 
united front with the Kuomintang and uniting with those who could 
still oppose Japanese imperialism, changed its pre-war policy of 
confiscating the land of the landlords and distributing it among the 
peasants to the policy of reducing rent and interest. This was entirely

164 MAO TSE-TUNG 
necessary. After the Japanese surrender, the peasants urgently demanded 
land, and we made a timely decision to change our land policy 
from reducing rent and interest to confiscating the land of the landlord 
class for distribution among the peasants. The directive issued by 
the Central Committee of our Party on May 4, 1946,3 marked this 
change. In September 1947 our Party called the National Land Conference 
and drew up the Outline Land Law of China,4 which was 
promptly carried out in all areas. This measure not only reaffirmed 
the policy set forth in last year¹s ³May 4th Directive² but also explicitly 
corrected a certain lack of thoroughness in that directive. The Outline 
Land Law provides for equal distribution of land per head,5 based 
on the principle of abolishing the land system of feudal and semi-feudal 
exploitation and putting into effect the system of land to the tillers. 
This is a method which most thoroughly abolishes the feudal system 
and fully meets the demands of the broad masses of China¹s peasants. 
To carry out the land reform resolutely and thoroughly, it is necessary 
to organize in the villages, as lawful bodies for carrying out the reform, 
not only peasant associations on the broadest mass basis, including 
farm labourers, poor peasants and middle peasants and their elected 
committees, but first of all poor peasant leagues composed of poor 
peasants and farm labourers and their elected committees; and these 
poor peasant leagues should be the backbone of leadership in all 
rural struggles. Our policy is to rely on the poor peasants and unite 
solidly with the middle peasants to abolish the feudal and semi-feudal 
system of exploitation by the landlord class and by the old-type rich 
peasants. Landlords or rich peasants must not be allotted more land 
and property than the peasant masses. But there should be no repetition 
of the wrong ultra-Left policy, which was carried out in 1931-34, of 
³allotting no land to the landlords and poor land to the rich peasants². 
Although the proportion of landlords and rich peasants in the rural 
population varies from place to place, it is generally only about 8 p e r 
cent (in terms of households), while their holdings usually amount to 70 
to 80 per cent of all the land. Therefore the targets of our land reform 
are very few, while the people in the villages who can and should take 
part in the united front for land reform are many ‹ more than 90 p e r 
cent (in terms of households). Here two fundamental principles must 
be observed. First, the demands of the poor peasants and farm labourers 
must be satisfied; this is the most fundamental task in the land 
reform. Second, there must be firm unity with the middle peasants, and 
their interests must not be damaged. As long as we grasp these two

165 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
basic principles, we can certainly carry out our tasks in the land reform 
successfully. The reason why, under the principle of equal distribution, 
the surplus land and part of the property of the old-type rich 
peasants should be handed over for distribution is that the rich peasants 
in China generally and to a great degree have the character of 
feudal and semi-feudal exploiters; most of them also rent out land 
and practise usury and they hire labour on semi-feudal terms.6 Furthermore, 
as the rich peasants have more and better land,7 the demands of 
the poor peasants and farm labourers cannot be satisfied unless this 
land is distributed. However, in accordance with the Outline Land 
Law, rich peasants should generally be treated differently from landlords. 
In the land reform, the middle peasants show approval of equal 
distribution because it does no harm to their interests. Under equal 
distribution, the land of one section of the middle peasants remains 
unchanged and that of another is increased; only the section of wellto-
do middle peasants has a little surplus land, and they are willing 
to hand it over for equal distribution because their burden of land 
tax will then be lightened. Nevertheless, in carrying out equal distribution 
of land in different places, it is necessary to listen to the 
opinions of the middle peasants and make concessions to them if they 
object. During the confiscation and distribution of the land and property 
of the feudal class, the needs of certain middle peasants should 
receive attention. In determining class status care must be taken to 
avoid the mistake of classifying middle peasants as rich peasants. The 
active middle peasants must be drawn into the work of the peasant 
association committees and the government. With respect to the 
burdens of the land tax and of supporting the war, the principle of 
being fair and reasonable must be observed. These are the specific 
policies our Party must follow in carrying out its strategic task of 
uniting solidly with the middle peasants. The whole Party must 
understand that thoroughgoing reform of the land system is a basic 
task of the Chinese revolution in its present stage. If we can solve 
the land problem universally and completely, we shall have obtained 
the most fundamental condition for the defeat of all our enemies. 
V 
To carry out the land reform resolutely and thoroughly and to 
consolidate the rear areas of the People¹s Liberation Army, it is

166 MAO TSE-TUNG 
necessary to educate and reorganize the ranks of our Party. On the 
whole, the rectification movement8 inside the Party during the War of 
Resistance Against Japan was successful. Its main success was that 
our leading bodies and large numbers of cadres and Party members 
obtained a firmer grasp of our basic orientation, which is to unite 
the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of 
the Chinese revolution. In this respect our Party has taken a big 
stride forward as compared with all the historical stages before the 
War of Resistance. However, in the Party¹s local organizations, 
especially the organizations at the primary level in the countryside, the 
problem of impurities in the class composition of our ranks and in our 
style of work is still unsolved. During the eleven years 1937-47 the 
membership of our Party has grown from several tens of thousands to 
2,700,000, and this is a very big leap forward. This has made our 
Party a more powerful party than any in Chinese history. It has enabled 
us to defeat Japanese imperialism, beat back Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
offensives, lead the Liberated Areas with a population of more than 100 
million and lead a People¹s Liberation Army two million strong. But 
shortcomings have also cropped up. Many landlords, rich peasants and 
riffraff have seized the opportunity to sneak into our Party. In the 
rural areas they control a number of Party, government and people¹s 
organizations, tyrannically abuse their power, ride roughshod over the 
people, distort the Party¹s policies and thus alienate these organizations 
from the masses and prevent the land reform from being thorough. This 
grave situation sets us the task of educating and reorganizing the ranks 
of our Party. We cannot make headway in the countryside unless 
we perform this task. The Party¹s National Land Conference discussed 
this problem thoroughly and laid down the proper measures 
and methods. These are now being resolutely applied everywhere, 
together with the decision on the equal distribution of land. First and 
foremost comes the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism within the 
Party and the thorough exposure of mistaken ideas and serious situations 
in the local organizations, which are departures from the Party 
line. All Party members must realize that a decisive link in the solution 
of the land problem and for the support of the long-drawn-out war 
is the removal of impurities from Party organizations and the education 
and reorganization of the Party¹s ranks, so that the Party and the 
broadest masses of working people can all march in the same direction 
and the Party can lead the masses forward.

167 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
VI 
Confiscate the land of the feudal class and turn it over to the 
peasants. Confiscate monopoly capital, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, 
T. V. Soong, H. H. Kung and Chen Li-fu, and turn it over to the 
new-democratic state. Protect the industry and commerce of the national 
bourgeoisie. These are the three major economic policies of 
the new-democratic revolution. During their twenty-year rule, the 
four big families, Chiang, Soong, Kung and Chen, have piled up 
enormous fortunes valued at ten to twenty thousand million U.S. 
dollars and monopolized the economic lifelines of the whole country. 
This monopoly capital, combined with state power, has become statemonopoly 
capitalism. This monopoly capitalism, closely tied up with 
foreign imperialism, the domestic landlord class and the old-type rich 
peasants, has become comprador, feudal, state-monopoly capitalism. 
Such is the economic base of Chiang Kai-shek¹s reactionary regime. 
This state-monopoly capitalism oppresses not only the workers and 
peasants but also the urban petty bourgeoisie, and it injures the middle 
bourgeoisie. This state-monopoly capitalism reached the peak of its 
development during the War of Resistance and after the Japanese 
surrender; it has prepared ample material conditions for the newdemocratic 
revolution. This capital is popularly known in China as 
bureaucrat-capital. This capitalist class, known as the bureaucratcapitalist 
class, is the big bourgeoisie of China. Besides doing away 
with the special privileges of imperialism in China, the task of the 
new-democratic revolution at home is to abolish exploitation and 
oppression by the landlord class and by the bureaucrat-capitalist class 
(the big bourgeoisie), change the comprador, feudal relations of 
production and unfetter the productive forces. The upper petty bourgeoisie 
and middle bourgeoisie, oppressed and injured by the landlords 
and big bourgeoisie and their state power, may take part in the newdemocratic 
revolution or stay neutral, though they are themselves 
bourgeois. They have no ties, or comparatively few, with imperialism 
and are the genuine national bourgeoisie. Wherever the state power 
of New Democracy extends, it must firmly and unhesitatingly protect 
them. In Chiang Kai-shek¹s areas, there are a small number of people 
among the upper petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie, the 
right wing of these classes, who have reactionary political tendencies, 
spread illusions about U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Chiang 
Kai-shek clique and oppose the people¹s democratic revolution. As

168 MAO TSE-TUNG 
long as their reactionary tendencies can affect the masses, we should 
unmask them before the people under their political influence, attack 
this influence and liberate the masses from it. But political attack and 
economic annihilation are two different matters, and we shall make 
mistakes if we confuse the two. The new-democratic revolution aims 
at wiping out only feudalism and monopoly capitalism, only the landlord 
class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class (the big bourgeoisie), 
and not at wiping out capitalism in general, the upper petty bourgeoisie 
or the middle bourgeoisie. In view of China¹s economic 
backwardness, even after the country-wide victory of the revolution, 
it will still be necessary to permit the existence for a long time of a 
capitalist sector of the economy represented by the extensive upper 
petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie. In accordance with the 
division of labour in the national economy, a certain development of 
all parts of this capitalist sector which are beneficial to the national 
economy will still be needed. This capitalist sector will still be an 
indispensable part of the whole national economy. The upper petty 
bourgeoisie referred to here are small industrialists and merchants 
employing workers or assistants. In addition, there are also great 
numbers of small independent craftsmen and traders who employ no 
workers or assistants and, needless to say, they should be firmly protected. 
After the victory of the revolution all over the country, the newdemocratic 
state will possess huge state enterprises taken over from 
the bureaucrat-capitalist class and controlling the economic lifelines 
of the country, and there will be an agricultural economy liberated 
from feudalism which, though it will remain basically scattered and 
individual for a fairly long time, can later be led to develop, step by 
step, in the direction of co-operatives. In these circumstances the 
existence and development of these small and middle capitalist sectors 
will present no danger. The same is true of the new rich peasant 
economy which will inevitably emerge in the rural areas after the 
land reform. It is absolutely impermissible to repeat such wrong 
ultra-Left policies towards the upper petty bourgeois and middle 
bourgeois sectors in the economy as our Party adopted during 1931-34 
(unduly advanced labour conditions, excessive income tax rates, encroachment 
on the interests of industrialists and merchants during the 
land reform, and the adoption as a goal of the so-called ³workers¹ 
welfare², which was a short-sighted and one-sided concept, instead of 
the goal of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, giving 
consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting

169 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
both labour and capital). To repeat such mistakes would certainly 
damage the interests both of the working masses and of the newdemocratic 
state. One of the provisions in the Outline Land Law of 
China reads, ³The property and lawful business of industrialists and 
merchants shall be protected from encroachment.² ³Industrialists and 
merchants² refers to all small independent craftsmen and traders as 
well as all small and middle capitalist elements. To sum up, the 
economic structure of New China will consist of: (1) the state-owned 
economy, which is the leading sector; (2) the agricultural economy, 
developing step by step from individual to collective; and (3) the 
economy of small independent craftsmen and traders and the 
economy of small and middle private capital. These constitute the 
whole of the new-democratic national economy. The principles guiding 
the new-democratic national economy must closely conform to the 
general objective of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, 
giving consideration to both public and private interests and 
benefiting both labour and capital. Any principle, policy or measure 
that deviates from this general objective is wrong. 
VII 
The People¹s Liberation Army issued a manifesto in October 1947 
which stated in part: 
Unite workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals and businessmen, 
all oppressed classes, all people¹s organizations, democratic 
parties, minority nationalities, overseas Chinese and other patriots; 
form a national united front; overthrow the dictatorial Chiang Kaishek 
government; and establish a democratic coalition government. 
That is the fundamental political programme of the People¹s Liberation 
Army and of the Communist Party of China. On the surface, our 
revolutionary national united front appears to have narrowed in the 
present period as compared with the period of the War of Resistance. 
As a matter of fact, it has been precisely in the present period, after 
Chiang Kai-shek sold out the nation¹s interests to U.S. imperialism 
and launched the country-wide civil war against the people and after the 
crimes of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique 
were completely exposed before the Chinese people, that our national

170 MAO TSE-TUNG 
united front has really broadened. During the War of Resistance, 
Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang were not yet completely discredited 
among the Chinese people and were still able to deceive them 
in many ways. Now it is different; all their deceptions have been 
shown up by their own deeds, they no longer have any mass following, 
they are completely isolated. In contrast to the Kuomintang, the 
Communist Party of China not only has the confidence of the broadest 
masses of the people in the Liberated Areas but has also won the 
support of the broad masses in the areas and big cities under Kuomintang 
control. If in 1946 a section of the upper petty bourgeois and 
middle bourgeois intellectuals under Chiang Kai-shek¹s rule still 
cherished the idea of a so-called third road,9 this idea is now bankrupt. 
Because our Party adopted a thoroughgoing land policy, it has won 
whole-hearted support from much broader masses of peasants than 
during the War of Resistance. As a result of U.S. imperialist aggression, 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s oppression and our Party¹s correct policy of 
firmly protecting the interests of the masses, our Party has won the 
sympathy of the broad masses of the working class, the peasantry and 
the urban petty and middle bourgeoisie in Chiang Kai-shek¹s areas. 
Driven by hunger, political oppression and Chiang Kai-shek¹s civil 
war against the people, which has made life impossible, the masses 
have been waging incessant struggles against U.S. imperialism and 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s reactionary government; their basic slogans are 
against hunger, against persecution, against civil war and against U.S. 
interference in China¹s internal affairs. Never before has their awakening 
reached such a level, neither before nor during the War of 
Resistance, nor in the period immediately after the Japanese surrender. 
That is why we say that our new-democratic revolutionary 
united front is now broader and more consolidated than ever. This 
development is not only linked with our land and urban policies but 
is also closely linked with the whole political situation ‹ with the 
victories of the People¹s Liberation Army, with Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
turn from the offensive to the defensive, with the People¹s Liberation 
Army¹s turn from the defensive to the offensive, with the period of 
a new high tide in the Chinese revolution. Realizing that Chiang Kaishek¹s 
regime is inevitably doomed, people now place their hopes on 
the Communist Party of China and the People¹s Liberation Army, 
and this is quite natural. Without the broadest united front of the 
overwhelming majority of the population, it will be impossible to 
win victory in China¹s new-democratic revolution. Moreover, this

171 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
united front must be under the firm leadership of the Communist 
Party of China. Without the Party¹s firm leadership, no revolutionary 
united front can win victory. When the Northern Expedition reached 
its climax in 1927, the capitulationists in our Party¹s leading body 
voluntarily gave up the Party¹s leadership of the peasant masses, 
urban petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie, and in particular 
gave up the Party¹s leadership of the armed forces, thus causing the 
defeat of the revolution. During the War of Resistance, our Party 
combated ideas similar to those of the capitulationists, that is, such 
ideas as making concessions to the Kuomintang¹s anti-popular policies, 
having more confidence in the Kuomintang than in the masses, not 
daring to arouse and give full rein to mass struggles, not daring to 
expand the Liberated Areas and the people¹s armies in the Japaneseoccupied 
areas, and handing over the leadership in the War of Resistance 
to the Kuomintang. Our Party waged a resolute struggle against 
such impotent and degenerate ideas, which run counter to the principles 
of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely carried out its political line of ³developing 
the progressive forces, winning over the middle forces and 
isolating the die-hard forces² and resolutely expanded the Liberated 
Areas and the People¹s Liberation Army. This ensured not only 
that our Party was able to defeat Japanese imperialism in the period 
of its aggression, but also that, in the period after the Japanese surrender 
when Chiang Kai-shek launched his counter-revolutionary war 
our Party was able to switch smoothly and without loss to the course of 
opposing Chiang Kai-shek¹s counter-revolutionary war with a people¹s 
revolutionary war and to win great victories in a short time. All Party 
comrades must keep these lessons of history firmly in mind. 
VIII 
When the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique launched the 
country-wide civil war against the people in 1946, the reason they 
dared take this risk was that they relied not merely on their own 
superior military strength but mainly on the U.S. imperialists with 
their atom bombs, whom they regarded as ³exceptionally powerful² 
and ³matchless in the world². On the one hand, they thought U.S. 
imperialism could meet their military and financial needs with a stream 
of supplies. On the other hand, they wildly speculated that ³war

172 MAO TSE-TUNG 
between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable² and 
that ³the outbreak of a third world war is inevitable². This dependence 
on U.S. imperialism is the common feature of the reactionary 
forces in all countries since World War II. It reflects the severity of 
the blows world capitalism received in World War II; it reflects the 
weakness of the reactionary forces in all countries, their panic and loss 
of confidence; and it reflects the might of the world revolutionary 
forces ‹ all of which make reactionaries in all countries feel that there 
is no way out except to rely on U.S. imperialist support. But, in fact, 
is U.S. imperialism after World War II as powerful as Chiang 
Kai-shek and the reactionaries of other countries imagine? Can it 
really pour out a stream of supplies for them? No, that is not so. 
The economic power of U.S. imperialism, which grew during World 
War II, is confronted with unstable and daily shrinking domestic and 
foreign markets. The further shrinking of these markets will cause 
economic crises to break out. The war boom in the United States 
of America was only temporary. The strength of the United States 
of America is only superficial and transient. Irreconcilable domestic 
and international contradictions, like a volcano, menace U.S. imperialism 
every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano. This 
situation has driven the U.S. imperialists to draw up a plan for 
enslaving the world, to run amuck like wild beasts in Europe, Asia 
and other parts of the world, to muster the reactionary forces in all 
countries, the human dregs cast off by their peoples, to form an imperialist 
and anti-democratic camp against all the democratic forces 
headed by the Soviet Union, and to prepare for war in the hope that 
in the future, at a distant time, some day, they can start a third world 
war to defeat the democratic forces. This is a preposterous plan. The 
democratic forces of the world must defeat this plan and certainly 
can defeat it. The strength of the world anti-imperialist camp has 
surpassed that of the imperialist camp. It is we, not the enemy, who 
are in the superior position. The anti-imperialist camp headed by 
the Soviet Union has already been formed. The socialist Soviet Union 
is free from crises, on the ascendant and cherished by the world¹s 
broad masses; its strength has already surpassed that of the imperialist 
United States, which is seriously menaced by crises, on the decline 
and opposed by the world¹s broad masses. The People¹s Democracies 
in Europe are consolidating themselves internally and are uniting with 
each other. In the European capitalist countries the people¹s antiimperialist 
forces are developing, with those in France and Italy

taking the lead. Within the United States, there are people¹s democratic 
forces which are getting stronger every day. The peoples of 
Latin America are not slaves obedient to U.S. imperialism. In the 
whole of Asia a great national liberation movement has arisen. All 
the forces of the anti-imperialist camp are uniting and forging ahead. 
The Communist and Workers¹ Parties of nine European countries 
have established their Information Bureau and issued a call to the 
people of the world to rise against the imperialist plan of enslavement.
10 This call to battle has inspired the oppressed people of the 
world, charted the course of their struggle and strengthened their 
confidence in victory. It has thrown world reaction into panic and 
confusion. All the anti-imperialist forces in the countries of the East, 
too, should unite together, oppose oppression by imperialism and by 
their domestic reactionaries and make the goal of their struggle the 
emancipation of the more than 1,000 million oppressed people of the 
East. We certainly should grasp our own destiny in our own hands. 
We should rid our ranks of all impotent thinking. All views that overestimate 
the strength of the enemy and underestimate the strength 
of the people are wrong. If everyone makes strenuous efforts, we, 
together with all the democratic forces of the world, can surely defeat 
the imperialist plan of enslavement, prevent the outbreak of a third 
world war, overthrow all reactionary regimes and win lasting peace 
for mankind. We are soberly aware that on our way forward there 
will still be all kinds of obstacles and difficulties and that we should 
be prepared to deal with the maximum resistance and desperate 
struggle by all our enemies, domestic and foreign. But so long as 
we can grasp the science of Marxism-Leninism, have confidence in 
the masses, stand closely together with the masses and lead them 
forward, we shall be fully able to surmount any obstacle and overcome 
any difficulty. Our strength will be invincible. This is the historic 
epoch in which world capitalism and imperialism are going down to 
their doom and world socialism and people¹s democracy are marching 
to victory. The dawn is ahead, we must exert ourselves.

Chiang Kai-shek¹s chief of general staff, was demoted to governor-general of the 
Northeast in August 1947 because of the successive defeats of the campaigns he directed 
in Shantung Province. 
3 For the directive, see ³A Three Months¹ Summary², Note 4, p. 118 of this 
volume. 
4 The National Land Conference of the Communist Party of China was held in 
September 1947 in Hsipaipo Village, Pingshan County, Hopei Province. The Outline 
Land Law of China, adopted by the conference on September 13, was published by 
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on October 10, 1947. It 
stipulated the following: 
Abolish the land system of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation and put 
into effect the system of land to the tillers. 
All the land of the landlords and the public land in the villages is to be 
taken over by the local peasant associations and, together with all other land 
there, is to be equally distributed among the entire rural population, regardless 
of sex or age. 
The peasant associations of the villages shall take over the draught animals, 
farm tools, houses, grain and other property of the landlords, requisition the 
surplus of such property of the rich peasants, distribute all this property among 
the peasants and other poor people who are in need of it and allot the same 
share to the landlords. 
Thus the Outline Land Law not only confirmed the principle of ³confiscation 
of the land of the landlords and its distribution among the peasants² laid down in 
the ³May 4th Directive² of 1946 but also made up for the lack of thoroughness in that 
directive, which had shown too much consideration for certain landlords. 
5 Subsequently in the implementation some changes were made in the method of 
equal distribution of land provided in the Outline Land Law of China. In February 
1948 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specified in its 
³Directive on the Work of Land Reform and of Party Consolidation in the Old and

175 PRESENT SITUATION AND OUR TASKS 
Semi-Old Areas² that in the old and semi-old Liberated Areas where the feudal system 
had already been overthrown, there would be no further equal distribution of land, but 
that the poor peasants and farm labourers who had not yet completely shaken off the 
feudal yoke should, if circumstances so required, be given a certain amount of land and 
other means of production through readjustment, by the method of taking from those 
who had a surplus and giving to those who had a shortage and taking from those who 
had better and giving to those who had worse, while the middle peasants would be 
allowed to keep more land than the average poor peasant. In areas where the feudal 
system still existed, equal distribution was confined mainly to the land and property of 
landlords and the surplus land and property of old-type rich peasants. In all areas, 
it was permissible to take the surplus land of middle peasants and new-type rich 
peasants for purposes of readjustment only if this was actually necessary and if the 
owners really consented. In the land reform in the new Liberated Areas, no land 
was to be taken from any middle peasant. 
6 The question of the rich peasants in China¹s land reform was a peculiar one 
arising from her specific historical and economic conditions. China¹s rich peasants 
differed from those in many capitalist countries in two respects: first, they generally 
and to a great degree had the character of feudal and semi-feudal exploiters and, 
second, this rich peasant economy did not occupy an important place in the country¹s 
agricultural economy. In the struggle against feudal exploitation by the landlord 
class in China, the broad masses of poor peasants and farm labourers also demanded 
the abolition of feudal and semi-feudal exploitation by the rich peasants. During 
the War of Liberation, the Communist Party of China adopted the policy of requisitioning 
the surplus land and property of rich peasants for distribution among the 
peasants, and thus satisfied the demands of the masses of poor peasants and farm 
labourers and ensured victory in the People¹s War of Liberation. As the war progressed 
towards victory, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 
February 1948 laid down new policies for the land reform in the new Liberated Areas. 
The reform was to be divided into two stages: in the first stage, neutralize the rich 
peasants and concentrate the blows on the landlords, primarily the big landlords; in the 
second stage, while distributing the land of the landlords, also distribute the land 
rented out by rich peasants and their surplus land, but continue to treat the rich peasants 
differently from the landlords (see ³Essential Points in Land Reform in the New 
Liberated Areas², pp. 201-02 of this volume). After the founding of the People¹s 
Republic of China, the Central People¹s Government in June 1950 promulgated the 
Land Reform Law, which provided that in the land reform only the land rented out by 
the rich peasants should partly or wholly be requisitioned, while the rest of their land 
and property was to be protected. In the subsequent stage of socialist revolution, 
the rich peasant economy disappeared as the movement for agricultural co-operation 
deepened and the rural economy developed. 
7 That is to say, a rich peasant household owned on the average more and 
better land than a poor peasant household. Taking the country as a whole, the quantity 
of the means of production owned by China¹s rich peasants and the volume of their 
farm produce were both very small. The rich peasant economy did not occupy an 
important place in China¹s rural economy. 
8 This refers to the movement for rectifying the style of work conducted 
by the Communist Party of China in 1942-43 throughout the Party; its content was 
the combating of subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped writing. Under the 
leadership of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, this rectification movement adopted the 
principles of ³learning from past mistakes to avoid their repetition, curing the 
sickness to save the patient² and ³clearing up wrong thinking while uniting with

176 MAO TSE-TUNG 
comrades². Through the method of criticism and self-criticism, the movement corrected 
the ³Left² and Right errors which had occurred on various occasions in the 
history of the Party by getting down to their ideological roots, greatly raised the 
ideological level of the broad ranks of Party cadres, helped immensely to unify thinking 
within the Party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and thus brought about a high 
degree of unity in the whole Party. 
9 In the early stage of the People¹s War of Liberation some democratic personages 
fancied that they could find a so-called third road, apart from the Kuomintang 
dictatorship of big landlords and big bourgeoisie and apart from the people¹s democratic 
dictatorship led by the Communist Party of China. This third road was in fact the 
road of a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie on the British and U.S. pattern. 
10 The Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers¹ Parties was founded 
at a meeting held in Warsaw, Poland, in September 1947 by representatives of the 
Communist and Workers¹ Parties of Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet 
Union, France, Czechoslovakia, Italy and Yugoslavia. Later, at a meeting in Rumania 
in June 1948, the Bureau announced the expulsion of the Yugoslav Communist Party 
because the latter persisted in its anti-Marxist-Leninist stand and adopted an attitude 
opposed to the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. The Information Bureau¹s call 
to the people of the world to rise against the imperialist plan of enslavement, mentioned 
here by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, was the ³Declaration on the International 
Situation² adopted at the September 1947 meeting of the Information Bureau.

ON SETTING UP A SYSTEM OF REPORTS* 
January 7, 1948 
In order to provide the Central Committee with timely information 
so that it can help all areas, either before or after the event, to 
avoid mistakes or commit fewer mistakes and win even greater victories 
in the revolutionary war, the following system of reports is 
instituted, beginning with this year. 
1. For each bureau or sub-bureau of the Central Committee, the 
secretary is responsible for submitting to the Central Committee and 
its chairman a comprehensive bi-monthly report (written by himself, 
not by his assistants). The report should cover military, political, land 
reform, Party consolidation, economic, propaganda and cultural activities, 
the problems and tendencies that have arisen in these activities 
and the methods of dealing with them. Each report should be limited 
to about a thousand words and, except in special cases, should not 
exceed two thousand words. When all questions cannot be covered 
in one report, write two. Or the first report may concentrate on 
certain questions and deal briefly with the rest, and the next report 
may concentrate on the latter and deal briefly with the former. The 
comprehensive report should be concise in content and succinct in 
wording and point out the problems or controversial issues. It should 
be written and telegraphed early in every odd month. This is to be 
the regular report and request for instructions which the secretary of 
each bureau or sub-bureau is personally responsible for submitting to 
the Central Committee and its chairman. When the secretary is at 
the front directing military operations, he should, in addition to 
submitting his own reports, authorize the acting secretary or deputy 
secretary to report on rear-area activities. The above does not include 
occasional reports and requests for instructions which the bureaus or 
sub-bureaus should continue to submit to the Central Committee. 
We are instituting this system of regular comprehensive policy 
reports and requests for instructions because, after the Seventh 
177

178 MAO TSE-TUNG 
National Congress of our Party, some (not all) comrades in the bureaus 
or sub-bureaus still do not realize the necessity and importance of 
submitting reports to the Central Committee and asking for instructions 
before or after the event, or they send reports and requests for 
instructions only on technical points; and, as a result, the Central Committee 
is not clear or is not sufficiently clear about their major activities 
and policies (not those of secondary importance or of a technical 
nature), and therefore certain things have occurred that cannot be 
remedied or are hard to remedy, or can be remedied but have already 
caused losses. Those bureaus and sub-bureaus that have asked for 
prior instructions and submitted reports afterwards have avoided or 
reduced such losses. Beginning with this year, the Party¹s leading 
bodies at all levels must correct the bad habit of neither asking the 
higher level for prior instructions nor submitting reports afterwards. 
The bureaus and sub-bureaus, being organs appointed by the Central 
Committee to carry out on its behalf the tasks entrusted to them, must 
keep in the closest possible contact with the Central Committee. Also, 
the provincial or area Party committees must keep in close contact 
with the bureaus and sub-bureaus of the Central Committee. At a 
time when the revolution has entered a period of new high tide, it is 
imperative to strengthen these contacts. 
2. Leaders of field armies and military areas, apart from their 
obligation to submit reports and requests for instructions on matters 
of strategy when necessary and their obligation to submit, as previously 
required, monthly reports on combat gains, on losses and 
munitions consumed and on the actual strength of their forces, must 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The system of reports instituted 
in the directive was a development under new conditions in the long struggle of the 
Central Committee firmly to uphold democratic centralism and combat tendencies 
of indiscipline and anarchy. The problem was especially important at that time 
because there had been tremendous progress in the revolutionary situation. Many 
Liberated Areas had been linked together, many cities had been or were about to 
be liberated, the People¹s Liberation Army had become much more of a regular army, 
the People¹s War of Liberation had become much more of a regular war, and countrywide 
victory was in sight. This situation demanded that the Party should speedily 
overcome any conditions of indiscipline or anarchy existing in the Party and the army 
and should concentrate in the Central Committee all the powers that had to be and 
could be centralized. The setting up of a strict system of reports was an important 
step taken by the Party for this purpose. On this question, see also ³The Work of 
Land Reform and of Party Consolidation in 1948², Section 6, p. 258 and ³On the 
September Meeting ‹ Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China², Point 4, pp. 273-74, of this volume.

179 ON SETTING UP A SYSTEM OF REPORTS 
also submit comprehensive policy reports and requests for instructions 
every two months, beginning this year. These should cover 
the discipline of the troops, their living conditions, the morale of 
commanders and fighters, any deviations that have arisen among commanders 
and fighters and the methods for overcoming them, the 
progress or retrogression in technique and tactics, the strong and weak 
points of the enemy forces and whether their morale is high or low, 
the political work of our army, its implementation of land policy, 
urban policy and policy concerning captives and the methods of overcoming 
deviations from these policies, the relations between the army 
and the people and the trends among different strata of the people. 
The length, method of writing and time of dispatch of these reports 
should be the same as those laid down for reports by the bureaus and 
sub-bureaus of the Central Committee. If intense fighting is going 
on when a report is due (that is, early in every odd month), its submission 
may be advanced or postponed a few days, but the reasons 
must be given. The section dealing with political work should be 
drafted by the director of the army¹s political department, examined 
and corrected by the commander and political commissar and then 
jointly signed by all three. These reports should be telegraphed to 
the Chairman of the Party¹s Military Commission. We require these 
comprehensive policy reports for the same reasons as we require such 
reports from the bureaus and sub-bureaus.


ON SOME IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF 
THE PARTY¹S PRESENT POLICY* 
January 18, 1948 
I. THE PROBLEM OF COMBATING ERRONEOUS 
TENDENCIES WITHIN THE PARTY 
Oppose overestimation of the enemy¹s strength. For example: 
fear of U.S. imperialism; fear of carrying the battle into the Kuomintang 
areas; fear of wiping out the comprador-feudal system, of distributing 
the land of the landlords and of confiscating bureaucrat-capital; fear 
of a long-drawn-out war; and so on. All these are incorrect. Imperialism 
throughout the world and the rule of the reactionary Chiang 
Kai-shek clique in China are already rotten and have no future. We 
have reason to despise them and we are confident and certain that we 
shall defeat all the domestic and foreign enemies of the Chinese people. 
But with regard to each part, each specific struggle (military, political, 
economic or ideological), we must never take the enemy lightly; on 
the contrary, we should take the enemy seriously and concentrate all 
our strength for battle in order to win victory. While we correctly 
point out that, strategically, with regard to the whole, we should take 
the enemy lightly, we must never take the enemy lightly in any 
part, in any specific struggle. If, with regard to the whole, we 
overestimate the strength of our enemy and hence do not dare to 
overthrow him and do not dare to win victory, we shall be committing 
a Right opportunist error. If, with regard to each part, each 
specific problem, we are not prudent, do not carefully study and 
perfect the art of struggle, do not concentrate all our strength for 
battle and do not pay attention to winning over all the allies that 
should be won over (middle peasants, small independent craftsmen 
and traders, the middle bourgeoisie, students, teachers, professors and 
ordinary intellectuals, ordinary government employees, professionals 
181

182 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and enlightened gentry), we shall be committing a ³Left² opportunist 
error. 
In combating ³Left² and Right deviations within the Party, we 
must decide on our policy according to specific circumstances. For 
example, the army must guard against ³Left² deviations in times of 
victory and guard against Right deviations in times of defeat or when 
we are unable to win many battles. In land reform, Right deviations 
must be combated where the masses have not yet been aroused in 
earnest and the struggle has not yet unfolded, and ³Left² deviations 
must be guarded against where the masses have been aroused in 
earnest and the struggle has already unfolded. 
II. SOME CONCRETE PROBLEMS OF POLICY IN 
THE LAND REFORM AND MASS MOVEMENTS 
1. The interests of the poor peasants and farm labourers and the 
forward role of the poor peasant leagues must be our first concern. 
Our Party must launch the land reform through the poor peasants and 
farm labourers and must enable them to play the forward role in the 
peasant associations and in the government organs of the rural districts. 
This forward role consists in forging unity with the middle peasants 
for common action and not in casting aside the middle peasants 
and monopolizing the work. The position of the middle peasants is 
especially important in the old Liberated Areas where the middle 
peasants are the majority and the poor peasants and farm labourers a 
minority. The slogan, ³the poor peasants and farm labourers conquer 
the country and should rule the country², is wrong. In the villages, 
it is the farm labourers, poor peasants, middle peasants and other 
working people, united together under the leadership of the Chinese 
Communist Party, who conquer the country and should rule the country, 
and it is not the poor peasants and farm labourers alone who 
conquer the country and should rule the country. In the country as 
a whole, it is the workers, peasants (including the new rich peasants), 
small independent craftsmen and traders, middle and small capitalists 
oppressed and injured by the reactionary forces, the students, teachers, 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China. See the introductory note to ³The 
Present Situation and Our Tasks², pp. 158-59 of this volume.

183 IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF THE PARTY¹S PRESENT POLICY 
professors and ordinary intellectuals, professionals, enlightened gentry, 
ordinary government employees, oppressed minority nationalities 
and overseas Chinese, all united together under the leadership of the 
working class (through the Communist Party), who conquer the country 
and should rule the country, and it is not merely some of the people 
who conquer the country and should rule the country. 
2. We must avoid adopting any adventurist policies towards the 
middle peasants. In the cases of middle peasants and persons of 
other strata whose class status has been wrongly determined, correction 
should be made without fail, and any of their belongings that 
have been distributed should be returned, as far as that is possible. 
The tendency to exclude middle peasants from the ranks of the 
peasants¹ representatives and from the peasants¹ committees and the 
tendency to counterpose them to the poor peasants and farm labourers 
in the land reform struggle must be corrected. Peasants with an 
income from exploitation should be classified as middle peasants if 
such income is less than 25 per cent of their total income, and classified 
as rich peasants if it is more.1 The land of well-to-do middle peasants 
must not be distributed without the owner¹s consent. 
3. We must avoid adopting any adventurist policies towards 
middle and small industrialists and merchants. The policy, adopted 
in the past in the Liberated Areas, of protecting and encouraging the 
development of all private industry and commerce beneficial to the 
national economy was correct and should be continued in the future. 
The policy of encouraging landlords and rich peasants to switch to 
industry and commerce, adopted during the period of rent and interest 
reduction, was also correct; it is wrong to regard such switching as a 
³disguise² and therefore to oppose it and confiscate and distribute 
the property so switched. The industrial and commercial holdings of 
landlords and rich peasants should in general be protected; the only 
industrial and commercial holdings that may be confiscated are those 
of bureaucrat-capitalists and of real counter-revolutionary local tyrants. 
Among the industrial and commercial enterprises which should be confiscated, 
those beneficial to the national economy must continue to 
operate after they have been taken over by the state and the people and 
must not be allowed to break up or close down. The transactions tax on 
the industry and commerce which are beneficial to the national economy 
should be levied only to the extent that it does not hamper their 
development. In each public enterprise, the administration and the 
trade union must set up a joint management committee to strengthen

184 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the work of management in order to reduce costs, increase output and 
see that both public and individual interests are benefited. Private 
capitalist enterprises should also try out this method in order to reduce 
costs, increase output and benefit both labour and capital. The workers¹ 
livelihood must be appropriately improved, but unduly high wages 
and benefits must be avoided. 
4. We must avoid adopting any adventurist policies towards 
students, teachers, professors, scientific workers, art workers and 
ordinary intellectuals. The experience of China¹s student movements 
and revolutionary struggles has proved that the overwhelming majority 
of these people can take part in the revolution or remain neutral; 
the die-hard counter-revolutionaries are a tiny minority. Our Party 
should, therefore, adopt a careful attitude towards students, teachers, 
professors, scientific workers, art workers and ordinary intellectuals. 
We should unite with them, educate them and give them posts according 
to the merits of each case, and only a tiny number of die-hard 
counter-revolutionaries among them will have to be appropriately dealt 
with through the mass line. 
5. On the question of the enlightened gentry. Our Party¹s 
co-operation with the enlightened gentry in government bodies (consultative 
councils and governments) in the Liberated Areas during the 
War of Resistance Against Japan was entirely necessary and also 
successful. Those enlightened gentry who went through hardships 
and tribulations together with our Party and actually made some contribution 
should be given consideration according to the merits of 
each case, provided that this does not interfere with land reform. 
Those who are fairly good politically and are competent should remain 
in the higher government bodies and be given appropriate work. 
Those who are fairly good politically but are not competent should 
have their livelihood assured. As for those who are of landlord 
or rich peasant origin but who have not incurred the people¹s deep 
resentment, their feudal landholdings and feudal property should be 
distributed according to the Land Law, but it should be seen to that 
they do not become targets of mass struggles. Those who have sneaked 
into our government bodies, who have in reality always been evil, who 
can be of no use to the people and who have incurred the extreme 
hatred of the broad masses, are to be handed over to the people¹s 
courts to be tried and punished like local tyrants. 
6. We must distinguish between the new rich peasants and the 
old rich peasants.2 The encouragement given to new rich peasants

185 IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF THE PARTY¹S PRESENT POLICY 
and well-to-do middle peasants during the period of rent and interest 
reduction proved effective in reassuring the middle peasants and in 
developing agricultural production in the Liberated Areas. After the 
equal distribution of land, we must call on the peasants to develop 
production so that they will be well-fed and well-clothed, and advise 
them to set up organizations for mutual aid and co-operation in 
agriculture, such as labour-exchange teams, mutual-aid teams and 
work-exchange groups.3 In the equal distribution of land the new 
rich peasants in the old Liberated Areas should be treated like wellto-
do middle peasants, and their land should not be distributed without 
the owner¹s consent. 
7. Among those landlords and rich peasants in the old Liberated 
Areas who changed their mode of living during the period of rent and 
interest reduction, the landlords who have engaged in physical labour 
for five years or more and the rich peasants whose condition has been 
reduced to that of middle or poor peasants for three years or more 
may now have their class status changed in accordance with their 
present condition, provided their behaviour has been good. Those 
who still possess a large amount of surplus property (not a small 
amount) should hand over the surplus in accordance with the peasants¹ 
demands. 
8. The heart of land reform is the equal distribution of the land 
of the feudal classes and of their property in grain, animals and farm 
implements (rich peasants hand over only their surplus property); we 
should not overemphasize the struggle to unearth hidden wealth4 and 
in particular should not spend too much time on this matter lest it 
should interfere with the main work. 
9. In dealing with landlords and rich peasants we should distinguish 
between them in accordance with the Outline Land Law. 
10. Within the framework of the principle of equal distribution 
of land, we should also distinguish among the big, middle and small 
landlords, as well as between those landlords and rich peasants who 
are local tyrants and those who are not. 
11. After the people¹s courts have given the handful of archcriminals 
who are really guilty of the most heinous crimes a serious 
trial and sentenced them and the sentences have been approved by 
appropriate government organizations (committees organized by local 
governments at county or sub-regional level), it is entirely necessary 
for the sake of revolutionary order to shoot them and announce their 
execution. That is one side of the matter. The other side is that we

MAO TSE-TUNG 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
186 
must insist on killing less and must strictly forbid killing without 
discrimination. To advocate killing more or killing without discrimination 
is entirely wrong; this would only cause our Party to forfeit 
sympathy, become alienated from the masses and fall into isolation. 
Trial and sentence by the people¹s courts, a form of struggle provided 
in the Outline Land Law, must be carried out in earnest; it is a 
powerful weapon of the peasant masses for striking at the worst 
elements among the landlords and rich peasants, it also avoids the 
mistake of beating and killing without discrimination. At the proper 
time (after the land struggle has reached its height), we should teach 
the masses to understand their own long-term interests ‹ to regard 
those landlords and rich peasants who do not persist in wrecking the 
war effort or the land reform and who number tens of millions in the 
country as a whole (as many as 36 million out of a rural population of 
about 360 million) as a labour force for the country and to save and 
remould them. Our task is to abolish the feudal system, to wipe out 
the landlords as a class, not as individuals. In accordance with the 
Land Law we must give them means of production and means of livelihood, 
but not more than to the peasants. 
12. We must criticize and struggle with certain cadres and Party 
members who have committed serious mistakes and certain bad elements 
among the masses of workers and peasants. In such criticism 
and struggle we should persuade the masses to adopt correct methods 
and forms and to refrain from rough actions. This is one side of the 
matter. The other side is that these cadres, Party members and bad 
elements should be made to pledge that they will not retaliate against 
the masses. It should be announced that the masses not only have 
the right to criticize them freely but also have the right to dismiss them 
from their posts when necessary or to propose their dismissal, or to 
propose their expulsion from the Party and even to hand the worst 
elements over to the people¹s courts for trial and punishment. 
III. ON THE PROBLEM OF STATE POWER 
1. The new-democratic state power is the anti-imperialist and 
anti-feudal state power of the masses of the people led by the working 
class. Here, the masses of the people include the working class, the 
peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie

187 IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF THE PARTY¹S PRESENT POLICY 
who are oppressed and injured by imperialism and by the reactionary 
Kuomintang regime and the classes it represents, namely, the 
bureaucrat-capitalist class (the big bourgeoisie) and the landlord class. 
The main body of the masses consists of the workers, peasants (soldiers 
being chiefly peasants in uniform) and other working people. The 
masses of the people form their own state (the People¹s Republic of 
China) and establish a government (the Central Government of the 
People¹s Republic of China) to represent this state. The working class 
through its vanguard, the Communist Party of China, exercises the 
leadership in this state belonging to the masses of the people and in its 
government. The enemies this People¹s Republic and its government 
oppose are foreign imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries at 
home and the classes they represent ‹ the bureaucrat-capitalist class 
and landlord class. 
2. The organs of state power of the People¹s Republic of China 
are the people¹s congresses at different levels and the governments at 
different levels which these congresses elect. 
3. In the rural areas in the present period, we can and should, in 
accordance with the demands of the peasants, convene village peasant 
meetings to elect the village governments, and convene district peasant 
congresses to elect the district governments. Since the governments 
at or above county or municipal level represent not only the peasants 
in the countryside but also the people of all strata and occupations in 
the towns, county seats, provincial capitals and big industrial and 
commercial cities, we should convene people¹s congresses at county, 
municipal, provincial or border region levels to elect the governments 
at corresponding levels. In the future after the revolution triumphs 
throughout the whole country, the central government and the local 
governments at all levels should be elected by the people¹s congresses 
at corresponding levels. 
IV. THE PROBLEM OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
THOSE WHO LEAD AND THOSE WHO ARE LED 
IN THE REVOLUTIONARY UNITED FRONT 
The leading class and the leading party must fulfil two conditions 
in order to exercise their leadership of the classes, strata, political 
parties and people¹s organizations which are being led:

188 MAO TSE-TUNG 
(a) Lead those who are led (allies) to wage resolute struggles 
against the common enemy and achieve victories; 
(b) Bring material benefits to those who are led or at least 
not damage their interests and at the same time give them political 
education. 
Without both these conditions, or with only one, leadership cannot be 
realized. As an example, the Communist Party, in order to lead the 
middle peasants, must lead them to struggle resolutely together with 
us against the feudal classes and achieve victories (destroying the 
landlords¹ armed force and dividing up their land). If there is no 
resolute struggle or if there is struggle but no victory, the middle 
peasants will vacillate. Furthermore, we must allot part of the land 
and other property of the landlords to those middle peasants who are 
relatively poor and must not damage the interests of the well-to-do 
middle peasants. In the peasant associations and the village and 
district governments we must draw the activists among the middle 
peasants into the work and must provide suitable quotas for them (for 
instance, one-third of the committee members). Do not make mistakes 
in determining the class status of middle peasants and be fair 
to them in regard to the land tax and civilian war service. At the 
same time, give the middle peasants political education. If we do 
not do all these things, we will lose the support of the middle 
peasants. In the cities, the same holds true for the working class and 
the Communist Party in exercising their leadership of the middle 
bourgeoisie, democratic parties and people¹s organizations oppressed 
and injured by the reactionary forces.

the Classes in the Rural Areas², Selected Work of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. I, and ³The 
Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party², Chapter 2, Section 4, Selected

2 The new rich peasants were those who had developed from middle peasants 
or poor peasants in the revolutionary base areas. The old rich peasants were those 
who had already been rich peasants before the revolutionary base areas were established. 
The old rich peasants generally and to a great degree had the character of feudal 
and semi-feudal exploiters. See ³The Present Situation and Our Tasks², Note 6,

189 IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF THE PARTY¹S PRESENT POLICY 
3 Labour-exchange teams and work-exchange groups were organizations for 
mutual aid and co-operation in agriculture. ³Labour-exchange² or ³work-exchange² 
was a means by which the peasants adjusted labour-power among themselves and 
took such forms as the exchange of man-workdays for man-workdays, ox-workdays 
for ox-workdays and man-workdays for ox-workdays. Peasants who joined labourexchange 
teams contributed their labour-power or animal-power to cultivate the land 
of each member-family in rotation or collectively. In settling accounts the workday 
was taken as the unit of exchange; those who contributed more man-workdays or 
animal-workdays were paid for the difference by those who contributed less.

THE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE ARMY* 
January 30, 1948
The policy for political work in our army units is fully to arouse 
the masses of soldiers, the commanders and all working personnel in 
order to achieve, through a democratic movement under centralized 
leadership, three major objectives, namely, a high degree of political 
unity, an improvement in living conditions and a higher level of 
military technique and tactics. The Three Check-ups and Three 
Improvements1 now being enthusiastically carried out in our army 
units are intended to attain the first two of these objectives through 
the methods of political and economic democracy. 
With regard to economic democracy, the representatives elected 
by the soldiers must be ensured the right to assist (but not to bypass) 
the company leadership in managing the company¹s supplies and mess. 
With regard to military democracy, in periods of training there 
must be mutual instruction as between officers and soldiers and among 
the soldiers themselves; and in periods of fighting the companies at 
the front must hold big and small meetings of various kinds. Under 
the direction of the company leadership, the masses of soldiers should 
be roused to discuss how to attack and capture enemy positions and 
how to fulfil other combat tasks. When the fighting lasts several 
days, several such meetings should be held. This kind of military 
democracy was practised with great success in the battle of Panlung2 
in northern Shensi and in the battle of Shihchiachuang3 in the Shansi- 
Chahar-Hopei area. It has been proved that the practice can only 
do good and can do no harm whatsoever. 
The masses of soldiers should have the right to expose the errors 
and misdeeds of bad elements among the cadres. We should be 
confident that the soldiers will cherish all the good and comparatively 
good cadres. Moreover, the soldiers should have the right, when 
necessary, to nominate those whom they trust from their own ranks 
191

192 MAO TSE-TUNG 
for lower-level cadre posts, subject to appointment by the higher level. 
When there is an acute shortage of lower-level cadres, this kind of 
nomination is very useful. It is not to be the rule, however, but is to 
be done only when necessary. 
NOTES 
1 The ³Three Check-ups² and ³Three Improvements² constituted an important 
movement for Party consolidation and for ideological education in the army which 
was carried out by our Party in conjunction with the land reform during the People¹s 
War of Liberation. In the localities, the ³Three Check-ups² meant checking on class 
origin, ideology and style of work; in the armed units, the check-ups were on class 
origin, performance of duty and will to fight. The ³Three Improvements² meant 
organizational consolidation, ideological education and rectification of style of work. 
2 Panlung, northeast of Yenan, was a town where the Northwest People¹s 
Liberation Army surrounded and wiped out over 6,700 Kuomintang troops under 
the command of Hu Tsung-nan in May 1947. 
3 Shihchiachuang was liberated by units of the People¹s Liberation Army of the 
Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Border Region on November 12, 1947. Its enemy garrison of 
more than 24,000 men was totally destroyed. It was the first important city liberated 
by the People¹s Liberation Army in northern China. 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China.

DIFFERENT TACTICS FOR CARRYING OUT 
THE LAND LAW IN DIFFERENT AREAS 
February 3, 1948
In carrying out the Land Law, it is necessary to distinguish three 
kinds of areas and to adopt different tactics for each. 
1. Old Liberated Areas established before the Japanese surrender. 
In general, land in these areas has long been distributed, and only a part 
of the distribution needs to be readjusted. Our work here should centre 
on educating and consolidating the ranks of the Party and solving the 
contradictions between the Party and the masses by combining the 
efforts of Party and non-Party people according to the experience 
gained in Pingshan County.1 In these old Liberated Areas what 
should be done is not to distribute the land a second time under the 
Land Law, or artificially and arbitrarily to organize poor peasant 
leagues to lead the peasant associations, but to organize poor peasant 
groups within the peasant associations. Activists in these groups can 
hold leading posts in the peasant associations and in the organs of 
political power in the rural areas, but it should not be made the rule 
that such posts go to the poor peasants to the exclusion of the middle 
peasants. In these areas the leading posts in the peasant associations 
and the organs of political power should be assumed by those activists 
among the poor and middle peasants who are correct in their thinking 
and fair and just in running affairs. The great majority of former 
poor peasants in these areas have developed into middle peasants, and 
the middle peasants now form the bulk of the rural population; therefore 
we must draw in the activists among the middle peasants to 
participate in the leadership of these rural areas. 
2. Areas liberated between the Japanese surrender and the time 
of the general counter-offensive, that is, in the two years between 
September 1945 and August 1947. These now form the largest part 
of the Liberated Areas and can be called the semi-old Liberated Areas. 
191

194 MAO TSE-TUNG 
In these areas, through the struggle to settle accounts during the last 
two years and through the carrying out of the ³May 4th Directive²,2 
the level of political consciousness and the degree of organization of the 
masses have been raised considerably, and there has been a preliminary 
solution of the land problem. But the political consciousness and the 
organization of the masses have not yet reached a high level, and the 
land problem is not yet thoroughly solved. In these areas the Land Law 
is entirely applicable, the distribution of land should be universal 
and thorough, and if it is not done well the first time, we should be 
prepared for a second distribution with one or two check-ups afterwards. 
In these areas the middle peasants are a minority and are 
taking a wait-and-see attitude. The poor peasants are the majority 
and are eagerly demanding land. Poor peasant leagues must therefore 
be organized and their leading position established in the peasant 
associations and the organs of political power in the rural areas. 
3. Areas newly liberated since the general counter-offensive. In 
these areas the masses have not yet been aroused, the Kuomintang, the 
landlords and the rich peasants still have great influence, and all our 
work has not yet taken root. Therefore, we should not try to enforce 
the Land Law all at once but should do it in two stages. The first 
stage is to neutralize the rich peasants and strike blows exclusively 
at the landlords. This stage should be further sub-divided into several 
steps, namely, propaganda, preliminary organization, distribution of the 
movable property3 of the big landlords, distribution of the land of 
the big and middle landlords with some consideration being given 
to the small landlords, and finally the distribution of the land of 
the landlord class. During this stage, poor peasant leagues should be 
organized as the backbone of leadership, and peasant associations may 
also be organized with the poor peasants as the main body. The second 
stage is to distribute the land rented out by the rich peasants, their 
surplus land4 and part of their other property, and to distribute that 
portion of the land of the landlords which was not thoroughly distributed 
in the first stage. The first stage should take about two 
years and the second a year. Haste will certainly do no good. Land 
reform and Party consolidation in the old and semi-old Liberated 
Areas should also take three, years (counting from this January); here 
haste will do no good either.

consolidation of the Party¹s primary organizations in the rural areas during the 
land reform.

CORRECT THE ³LEFT² ERRORS IN 
LAND REFORM PROPAGANDA* 
February 11, 1948 
In the past few months our news agency and newspapers in many 
places have publicized without discrimination or analysis many unsound 
reports and articles containing ³Left² deviationist errors. Here are 
some examples. 
1. They did not propagate the line of relying on the poor peasants 
and farm labourers and firmly uniting with the middle peasants in 
order to abolish the feudal system, but one-sidedly propagated a poor 
peasant-farm labourer line. They did not propagate the view that the 
proletariat should unite with all working people and others who are 
oppressed, the national bourgeoisie, the intellectuals and other patriots 
(including the enlightened gentry who do not oppose land reform) in 
order to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratcapitalism 
and establish a People¹s Republic of China and a people¹s 
democratic government, but one-sidedly propagated the view that the 
poor peasants and farm labourers conquer the country and should rule 
the country, or that the democratic government should be a government 
of the peasants only, or that the democratic government should listen 
only to the workers, poor peasants and farm labourers, while no mention 
at all was made of the middle peasants, the independent craftsmen, the 
national bourgeoisie and the intellectuals. This is a serious error of 
principle. Yet reports of this kind have been circulated by our news 
agency, newspapers and radio stations. And the propaganda departments 
of the Party committees in various places have failed to report 
these errors to the higher levels. In the past few months such propaganda, 
though not widespread, has been fairly frequent and has 
created an atmosphere in which people have been misled into believing 
that it might represent the correct leading ideas. Because the Northern 
Shensi Radio Station broadcast some incorrect items, people even 
197

198 MAO TSE-TUNG 
mistakenly believed that these were views approved by the Central 
Committee. 
2. On the question of Party consolidation, there has not been 
sufficiently vigorous propaganda in some areas either against taking 
no account of class origin or against taking account of class origin 
alone, and there has even been erroneous propaganda which advocates 
taking account of class origin alone. 
3. On the question of land reform, in some areas propaganda 
against both hesitation and rashness has been taken well in hand; 
but in many areas rashness has been encouraged and articles praising 
it have even been published. On the question of the relationship 
between the leadership and the masses, attention has been given in 
some areas to conducting propaganda against both commandism and 
tailism, but in many areas there has been an erroneous emphasis 
on ³doing everything as the masses want it done² and an accommodation 
to wrong views existing among the masses. Even wrong 
views held not by the masses but only by a few individuals have been 
uncritically accepted. This negates the leading role of the Party and 
encourages tailism. 
4. With regard to policies concerning industry and commerce and 
the working-class movement, serious ³Left² deviations existing in 
certain Liberated Areas have been either praised or ignored. 
To sum up, in the past few months our propaganda work has 
correctly reflected and guided the great struggles ‹ the war, the land 
reform, Party consolidation, production and support for the front ‹ 
and contributed to their great achievements; this is the major aspect 
of our propaganda work, and it must be affirmed first of all. But 
some errors and shortcomings must also be noted. They are of an 
ultra-Left character. A few run completely counter to the principles 
and standpoint of Marxism-Leninism and depart completely from the 
line of the Central Committee. It is expected that the bureaus and 
sub-bureaus of the Central Committee, their propaganda departments, 
the central and regional head offices of the Hsinhua News Agency 
and the comrades working on all the newspapers will check up on 
the propaganda work of the last few months on the basis of Marxist- 
Leninist principles and the line of the Central Committee, extend 
their achievements, correct their errors and see to it that their work 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

199 CORRECT ³LEFT² ERRORS IN LAND REFORM PROPAGANDA 
helps to ensure victory in these great struggles ‹ the war, the land 
reform, Party consolidation, the working-class movement ‹ and to ensure 
victory in the whole anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution. 
The propaganda departments of the Party committees in all areas and 
the central office of the Hsinhua News Agency should assume the 
main responsibility for this check-up and should submit, in their own 
names, policy reports on its results to the Propaganda Department of 
the Central Committee.


ESSENTIAL POINTS IN LAND REFORM 
IN THE NEW LIBERATED AREAS* 
February 15, 1948
1. Do not be impetuous. The speed of land reform should be 
determined according to the circumstances, the level of political consciousness 
of the masses and the strength of leading cadres. Do not 
attempt to complete the land reform in a few months, but prepare to 
complete it in each area in two or three years. This also applies to 
the old or semi-old Liberated Areas. 
2. Land reform in a new Liberated Area should be divided into 
two stages. In the first stage strike blows at the landlords and neutralize 
the rich peasants. This stage is to be sub-divided into several 
steps; strike blows at the big landlords first, and then at the other 
landlords. Treatment must be different for those who are local 
tyrants and those who are not, and different also for big, middle and 
small landlords. The second stage is the equal distribution of land, 
including the land rented out by the rich peasants and their surplus 
land. However, the treatment of rich peasants should differ from 
that of landlords. The total scope of attack should generally not 
exceed 8 per cent of the households or 10 per cent of the population. 
In the semi-old Liberated Areas the differences in treatment and the 
total scope of attack should be the same. These questions do not 
arise in the old Liberated Areas, where in general only minor adjustments 
in the distribution of land1 are needed. 
3. Organize poor peasant leagues first and then, after a few 
months, peasant associations. Strictly prohibit landlords and rich 
peasants from sneaking into the peasant associations and poor peasant 
leagues. Activists in the poor peasant leagues should become the 
backbone of leadership in peasant associations, but a section of the 
activists among the middle peasants must also be drawn into the committees 
of peasant associations. In the land reform struggle, the 
201

202 MAO TSE-TUNG 
middle peasants must be drawn in to participate, and their interests 
should be given consideration. 
4. Do not start the work in all places at the same time, but 
choose strong cadres to carry it out first in certain places to gain experience, 
then spread the experience step by step and expand the work 
in waves. This applies to a whole strategic area as well as to a single 
county. It also applies to the old and the semi-old Liberated Areas. 
5. Distinguish between consolidated Liberated Areas and guerrilla 
zones. In the former, land reform can proceed step by step. In the 
latter, we should confine ourselves to propaganda, covert organizational 
work and the distribution of a certain amount of movable property. 
Mass organizations should not be openly set up and land reform 
should not be carried out, lest the enemy should persecute the masses. 
6. The reactionary armed bands of the landlords and the reactionary 
secret police must be destroyed and must not be utilized. 
7. Reactionaries must be suppressed, but killing without discrimination 
is strictly forbidden; the fewer killings, the better. Death 
sentences should be reviewed and approved by a committee formed 
at the county level. The power to try and to deal with the cases of 
political suspects is vested in committees at the district Party committee 
level. This applies in the old as well as the semi-old Liberated Areas. 
8. Local revolutionary intellectuals and semi-intellectuals who 
come from landlord or rich peasant families but support land reform 
should be utilized and drawn into the work of building the base areas. 
But we must intensify our educational work among them and prevent 
them from entrenching themselves in power and hindering land reform. 
In general we should not let them work in their native districts or 
townships. Emphasis should be placed on employing intellectuals 
or semi-intellectuals from peasant families. 
9. Pay strict attention to the protection of industry and commerce. 
Take a long-term view in the planning and management of 
economic and financial affairs. The armed forces and district and 
township governments should all guard against waste.

of this volume.

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

ON THE POLICY CONCERNING 
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE* 
February 27, 1948
1. Party organizations in certain places have violated the policy 
of the Central Committee of the Party concerning industry and commerce 
and seriously damaged both. These mistakes must be speedily 
corrected. In correcting them the Party committees in these places 
must make a careful check-up from the two aspects of guiding policies 
and methods of leadership. 
2. Guiding policies. Precautions should be taken against the 
mistake of applying in the cities the measures used in rural areas for 
struggling against landlords and rich peasants and for destroying the 
feudal forces. A sharp distinction should be made between the feudal 
exploitation practised by landlords and rich peasants, which must be 
abolished, and the industrial and commercial enterprises run by landlords 
and rich peasants, which must be protected. A sharp distinction 
should also be made between the correct policy of developing production, 
promoting economic prosperity, giving consideration to both 
public and private interests and benefiting both labour and capital, 
and the one-sided and narrow-minded policy of ³relief², which purports 
to uphold the workers¹ welfare but in fact damages industry and commerce 
and impairs the cause of the people¹s revolution. Education 
should be conducted among comrades in the trade unions and among 
the masses of workers to enable them to understand that they should 
not see merely the immediate and partial interests of the working 
class while forgetting its broad, long-range interests. Under the local 
government¹s leadership, workers and capitalists should be led to 
organize joint committees for the management of production and to 
do everything possible to reduce costs, increase output and stimulate 
sales so as to attain the objectives of giving consideration to both 
public and private interests, benefiting both labour and capital and 
203

204 MAO TSE-TUNG 
supporting the war. The mistakes committed in many places are due 
to the failure to grasp all, most or some of the above policies. The 
bureaus and sub-bureaus of the Central Committee should raise this 
question clearly, analyse, check up, formulate correct policies and issue 
inner-Party directives and government decrees. 
3. Methods of leadership. After policies have been fixed and 
directives issued, a bureau or sub-bureau of the Central Committee 
should keep in close contact with its area and prefectural Party committees1 
or with its own working teams by telegraph or telephone, by 
couriers on vehicles or on horseback, or by personal interviews; it 
should use the newspaper as an important instrument of organization 
and leadership. It should constantly have a grip on the progress of 
the work, exchange experience and correct mistakes; it should not 
wait several months, half a year or a year before holding summing-up 
meetings for a general check-up and a general correction of mistakes. 
Waiting leads to great loss, while correcting mistakes as soon as they 
occur reduces loss. In ordinary circumstances a bureau of the Central 
Committee should strive to keep in close contact with its subordinate 
organizations, always take care to draw a sharp line between what 
should and what should not be done, and constantly remind its subordinate 
organizations of this so that they may make as few mistakes 
as possible. All these are questions of methods of leadership. 
4. All comrades in the Party should understand that the enemy 
is now completely isolated. But his isolation is not tantamount to 
our victory. If we make mistakes in policy, we shall still be unable to 
win victory. To put it concretely, we shall fail if we make, and do not 
correct, mistakes of principle with regard to any of the five policies ‹ 
on the war, Party consolidation, land reform, industry and commerce, 
and the suppression of counter-revolution. Policy is the starting-point 
of all the practical actions of a revolutionary party and manifests itself 
in the process and the end-result of that party¹s actions. A revolutionary 
party is carrying out a policy whenever it takes any action. 
If it is not carrying out a correct policy, it is carrying out a wrong 
policy; if it is not carrying out a given policy consciously, it is doing 
so blindly. What we call experience is the process and the end-result 
of carrying out a policy. Only through the practice of the people, 
that is, through experience, can we verify whether a policy is correct 
or wrong and determine to what extent it is correct or wrong. But 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

205 ON POLICY CONCERNING INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE 
people¹s practice, especially the practice of a revolutionary party and 
the revolutionary masses, cannot but be related to one policy or another. 
Therefore, before any action is taken, we must explain the 
policy, which we have formulated in the light of the given circumstances, 
to Party members and to the masses. Otherwise, Party members and 
the masses will depart from the guidance of our policy, act blindly and 
carry out a wrong policy.

Party committee or Border Region Party committee but higher than the county 
Party committee.


ON THE QUESTION OF 
THE NATIONAL BOURGEOISIE AND 
THE ENLIGHTENED GENTRY* 
March 1, 1948
The Chinese revolution at the present stage is in its character a 
revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism 
waged by the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the 
proletariat. By the broad masses of the people is meant all those 
who are oppressed, injured or fettered by imperialism, feudalism and 
bureaucrat-capitalism, namely, workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, 
businessmen and other patriots, as clearly stated in the Manifesto of the 
Chinese People¹s Liberation Army of October 1947.1 In the manifesto 
³intellectuals² means all intellectuals who are persecuted and fettered. 
³Businessmen² means all the national bourgeois who are persecuted 
and fettered, that is, the middle and petty bourgeois. ³Other patriots² 
refers primarily to the enlightened gentry. The Chinese revolution at 
the present stage is a revolution in which all these people form a united 
front against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism and in 
which the working people are the main body. By working people are 
meant all those engaged in manual labour (such as workers, peasants, 
handicraftsmen, etc.) as well as those engaged in mental labour who 
are close to those engaged in manual labour and are not exploiters 
but are exploited. The aim of the Chinese revolution at the present 
stage is to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratcapitalism 
and to establish a new-democratic republic of the broad 
masses of the people with the working people as the main force; its 
aim is not to abolish capitalism in general. 
We should not abandon the enlightened gentry who co-operated 
with us in the past and continue to co-operate with us at present, who 
approve of the struggle against the United States and Chiang Kaishek 
and who approve of the land reform. Take, for instance, people 
207

208 MAO TSE-TUNG 
like Liu Shao-pai of the Shansi-Suiyuan Border Region and Li Tingming 
of the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region.2 Since they gave 
us considerable help in the hard times during and after the War of 
Resistance Against Japan and did not obstruct or oppose the land 
reform when we were carrying it out, we should continue the policy of 
uniting with them. But uniting with them does not mean treating 
them as a force that determines the character of the Chinese revolution. 
The forces that determine the character of a revolution are the 
chief enemies on the one side and the chief revolutionaries on the other. 
At present our chief enemies are imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratcapitalism, 
while the main forces in our struggle against these enemies 
are the people engaged in manual and mental labour, who make up 
90 per cent of the country¹s population. And this determines that 
our revolution at the present stage is a new-democratic, a people¹s 
democratic revolution in character and is different from a socialist 
revolution such as the October Revolution. 
The few right-wingers among the national bourgeoisie who attach 
themselves to imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism and 
oppose the people¹s democratic revolution are also enemies of the 
revolution, while the left-wingers among the national bourgeoisie who 
attach themselves to the working people and oppose the reactionaries 
are also revolutionaries, as are the few enlightened gentry who have 
broken away from the feudal class. But the former are not the main 
body of the enemy any more than the latter are the main body among 
the revolutionaries; neither is a force that determines the character 
of the revolution. The national bourgeoisie is a class which is politically 
very weak and vacillating. But the majority of its members 
may either join the people¹s democratic revolution or take a neutral 
stand, because they too are persecuted and fettered by imperialism, 
feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism. They are part of the broad 
masses of the people but not the main body, nor are they a force that 
determines the character of the revolution. However, because they 
are important economically and may either join in the struggle against 
the United States and Chiang Kai-shek or remain neutral in that 
struggle, it is possible and necessary for us to unite with them. Before 
the birth of the Communist Party of China, the Kuomintang headed 
by Sun Yat-sen represented the national bourgeoisie and acted as the 
leader of the Chinese revolution of that time (a non-thorough demo- 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

209 NATIONAL BOURGEOISIE AND ENLIGHTENED GENTRY 
cratic revolution of the old type). But after the Communist Party of 
China was born and demonstrated its ability, the Kuomintang could 
no longer be the leader of the Chinese revolution (a new-democratic 
revolution). The national bourgeoisie joined the 1924-27 revolutionary 
movement3 and during the years 1927-31 (before the September 18th 
Incident of 1931) quite a few of them sided with the reaction under 
Chiang Kai-shek. But one must not on this account think that we 
should not have tried during that period to win over the national 
bourgeoisie politically or to protect it economically, or that our ultra- 
Left policy towards the national bourgeoisie was not adventurist. On 
the contrary, in that period our policy should still have been to protect 
the national bourgeoisie and win it over so as to enable us to concentrate 
our efforts on fighting the chief enemies. In the period of the War 
of Resistance the national bourgeoisie was a participant in the war, 
wavering between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At 
the present stage the majority of the national bourgeoisie has a growing 
hatred of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek; its left-wingers 
attach themselves to the Communist Party and its right-wingers to the 
Kuomintang, while its middle elements take a hesitant, wait-and-see 
attitude between the two parties. These circumstances make it necessary 
and possible for us to win over the majority of the national 
bourgeoisie and isolate the minority. To achieve this aim, we should 
be prudent in dealing with the economic position of this class and in 
principle should adopt a blanket policy of protection. Otherwise we 
shall commit political errors. 
The enlightened gentry are individual landlords and rich peasants 
with democratic leanings. Such people have contradictions with 
bureaucrat-capitalism and imperialism and to a certain extent also 
with the feudal landlords and rich peasants. We unite with them 
not because they are a political force to be reckoned with nor because 
they are of any economic importance (their feudal landholdings should 
be handed over with their consent to the peasants for distribution) 
but because they gave us considerable help politically during the War 
of Resistance and during the struggle against the United States and 
Chiang Kai-shek. During the period of land reform, it will help 
the land reform throughout the country if some of the enlightened 
gentry favour it. In particular, it will help win over the intellectuals 
(most of whom come from landlord or rich peasant families), the 
national bourgeoisie (most of whom have ties with the land) and 
the enlightened gentry throughout the country (who number several

210 MAO TSE-TUNG 
hundred thousand) and help isolate the chief enemy of the Chinese 
revolution, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. It is precisely because 
they have this role that the enlightened gentry also constitute an 
element in the revolutionary united front against imperialism, feudalism 
and bureaucrat-capitalism; therefore, attention must also be paid to 
the question of uniting with them. During the period of the War of 
Resistance, what we required of the enlightened gentry was that they 
should favour resistance against Japan, favour democracy (not be anti- 
Communist) and favour reduction of rent and interest; at the present 
stage, what we require of them is that they favour the struggle against 
the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, favour democracy (not be 
anti-Communist) and favour the land reform. If they can meet these 
requirements, we should unite with them without exception and while 
uniting with them educate them.

ON THE GREAT VICTORY IN THE NORTHWEST 
AND ON THE NEW TYPE OF 
IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION MOVEMENT 
IN THE LIBERATION ARMY* 
March 7, 1948
Commenting on the recent great victory of the Northwest People¹s 
Liberation Army, a spokesman for the General Headquarters of the 
People¹s Liberation Army said: This victory has changed the situation 
in the Northwest and will affect the situation in the Central 
Plains. It has proved that through the new type of ideological education 
movement in the army by the methods of ³pouring out grievances² 
and of the ³three check-ups² the People¹s Liberation Army will make 
itself invincible. 
The spokesman said: On this occasion, the Northwest People¹s 
Liberation Army suddenly encircled an enemy brigade at Yichuan, and 
Hu Tsung-nan ordered Liu Kan, Commander of his 29th Corps, to 
rush 4 brigades of 2 reorganized divisions from the Lochuan-Yichun 
line to the relief of Yichuan. They were the 31st and 47th Brigades 
of the Reorganized 27th Division and the 53rd and 61st Brigades of 
the Reorganized 90th Division, totalling more than 24,000 men; they 
reached the area southwest of Yichuan on February 28. The Northwest 
People¹s Liberation Army started a battle of annihilation and 
in thirty hours of fighting on February 29 and March 1 completely 
wiped out these reinforcements, letting none escape from the net. 
More than 18,000 men were captured, and more than 5,000 were killed 
and wounded; Liu Kan himself, Yen Ming, Commander of the 90th 
Division, and other officers were killed. Then on March 3 we captured 
Yichuan and here again wiped out over 5,000 men of the 24th 
Brigade of the enemy¹s Reorganized 76th Division which was defending 
the city. In this campaign we wiped out, all told, 1 corps headquarters, 
211

212 MAO TSE-TUNG 
2 division headquarters and 5 brigades of the enemy, a total of 30,000 
men. This is our first great victory in the Northwest theatre. 
Analysing the situation in the Northwest theatre, the spokesman 
said: Of the 28 brigades of the so-called ³Central Army² directly 
commanded by Hu Tsung-nan, 8 belonged to his, crack divisions, 
the Reorganized 1st, 36th and 90th Divisions. Of these divisions, the 
1st Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division had been wiped out1 by us 
once before at Fushan, southern Shansi, in September 1946 and the main 
force of the same division¹s 167th Brigade had been wiped out once at 
Panlung town, northern Shensi, in May last year; the 123rd and 165th 
Brigades of the Reorganized 36th Division had been wiped out once 
at Shachiatien in Michih County, northern Shensi, in August last year; 
and this time the Reorganized 90th Division was also completely 
wiped out. Of the remainder of Hu Tsung-nan¹s main force, only 
the 78th Brigade of the Reorganized 1st Division and the 28th Brigade 
of the Reorganized 36th Division have not yet been wiped out. Hu 
Tsung-nan¹s whole army can therefore be said to have practically no 
more crack units. As a result of the Yichuan battle of annihilation, 
of the 28 regular brigades formerly under Hu Tsung-nan¹s direct 
command, only 23 are left. These 23 brigades are distributed in the 
following areas: 1 brigade at Linfen in southern Shansi is immobilized 
and doomed, 9 brigades are on the Shensi-Honan border and along 
the Loyang-Tungkuan line to cope with our field army under Chen 
* This commentary was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the spokesman 
of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army. At that time 
the enemy offensive in the Northwest theatre of war had been smashed, and our army 
had gone over to its own offensive. This commentary analysed the situation in the 
Northwest theatre and also outlined conditions in the other theatres of war. More 
important, it stressed the great significance of the new type of ideological education 
movement in the army, carried out by the methods of ³pouring out grievances² and 
of the ³three check-ups². This new type of movement was an important development 
of the political work and the democratic movement in the People¹s Liberation Army. 
It was the reflection in the army of the movements for land reform and Party 
consolidation then vigorously proceeding in all the Liberated Areas. This movement 
greatly enhanced the political consciousness, discipline and combat effectiveness 
of all officers and soldiers. At the same time it most effectively speeded the 
process of reforming large numbers of captured Kuomintang soldiers into Liberation 
Army fighters. Thus it played an important role in consolidating and expanding 
the People¹s Liberation Army and in ensuring victories in the field. For the 
significance of this movement, see also ³The Democratic Movement in the Army², 
pp. 191-92, ³Speech at a Conference of Cadres in the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area², 
pp. 227-39, and ³On the September Meeting ‹ Circular of the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China², pp. 269-77, of this volume.

Keng and Hsieh Fu-chih, and another brigade in southern Shensi is 
guarding the Hanchung area. The remaining 12 brigades are distributed 
along the T-shaped communication lines from Tungkuan to 
Paoki and from Hsienyang to Yenan. Of these, 3 are ³reserve 
brigades² composed entirely of recruits, 2 have been completely wiped 
out by our army and replenished recently, another 2 have received 
crushing blows from us and 5 have received relatively few blows. It 
can be seen that not only are these forces very weak but also they 
are mostly on garrison duty. In addition to Hu Tsung-nan¹s army, 
there are 2 brigades under Teng Pao-shan defending Yulin, while 9 
brigades under Ma Hung-kuei of Ningsia Province and Ma Pu-fang 
of Chinghai Province are distributed in the Sanpien and Lungtung 
areas.2 All the regular troops under Hu Tsung-nan, Teng Pao-shan 
and the two Mas now total 34 brigades, including the units replenished 
after having been wiped out once or twice. 
That is how things stand with the enemy in the Northwest. 
To return to the T-shaped communication lines, of those 5 brigades 
which have received relatively few blows, 2 are hemmed in at Yenan 
and 3 are in the Greater Kuanchung Area.3 As for the other brigades 
there, most of them have been recently replenished, and a few have 
received crushing blows. In other words, the enemy¹s forces in the 
whole Greater Kuanchung Area and especially in Kansu Province are 
very sparse and weak and cannot possibly stop the offensive of the 
People¹s Liberation Army. This situation is bound to affect some of 
the dispositions of Chiang Kai-shek¹s forces on the southern front and, 
first of all, his dispositions vis-à-vis our field army under Chen Keng 
and Hsieh Fu-chih on the Honan-Shensi border. In its present southward 
drive the Northwest People¹s Liberation Army has won victory 
as soon as its banner was displayed, gained resounding fame and 
changed the relation of forces between the enemy and ourselves in the 
Northwest; from now on it will be able to fight even more effectively 
in co-ordination with the forces of the People¹s Liberation Army on 
the southern fronts. 
The spokesman said: Since last summer and autumn our three field 
armies, commanded respectively by Liu Po-cheng and Teng Hsiaoping, 
Chen Yi and Su Yu, and Chen Keng and Hsieh Fu-chih, have 
advanced south across the Yellow River, swept through the length and 
breadth of the territory enclosed by the Yangtse, Huai, Yellow and Han 
Rivers, wiped out large numbers of enemy troops, manipulated and 
drawn towards themselves some 90 out of the 160 odd brigades which

214 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Chiang Kai-shek has on the southern front, forced his armies into a 
passive position, played a decisive strategic role and won the acclaim 
of the people all over the country.4 In its winter offensive our Northeast 
Field Army braved bitter cold of 30 degrees below zero, annihilated 
most of the enemy troops, captured one well-known city after 
another and won resounding fame throughout the country.5 After 
wiping out large numbers of enemy troops in heroic battles last year,6 
our field armies in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei area, Shantung, northern 
Kiangsu and the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan area completed their 
training and consolidation last winter, and they will soon unfold their 
spring offensive.7 A review of the whole situation proves one truth. 
Provided we firmly oppose conservatism, fear of the enemy and fear 
of difficulties, and provided we follow the general strategy of the 
Central Committee of the Party and its directive on the ten major 
principles of operation,8 we can unfold our offensives, wipe out vast 
numbers of enemy troops and strike such blows at the forces of the 
Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that they can only parry them for a time 
without being able to hit back, or that they cannot even parry our 
blows and will be completely wiped out, one after another. 
The spokesman emphatically pointed out: The combat effectiveness 
of our Northwest Field Army is far higher than at any time last 
year.9 In last year¹s fighting the Northwest Field Army could destroy 
at most two enemy brigades at a time; now in the Yichuan campaign 
it has been able to wipe out five enemy brigades at one time. The 
reasons for this outstanding victory were many, among which we should 
point out the firm yet flexible command of the leading comrades at 
the front, the energetic support given by the leading comrades and the 
broad masses in the rear, the relative isolation of the enemy troops and 
a terrain favourable to us. What is most noteworthy, however, is the 
new type of ideological education movement in the army, which was 
carried out for more than two months last winter by the methods of 
pouring out grievances and the three check-ups. The correct unfolding 
of the movement for pouring out grievances (the wrongs done to the 
labouring people by the old society and by the reactionaries) and 
the three check-ups (on class origin, performance of duty and will 
to fight) greatly heightened the political consciousness of commanders 
and fighters throughout the army in the fight for the emancipation of 
the exploited working masses, for nation-wide land reform and for the 
destruction of the common enemy of the people, the Chiang Kai-shek 
bandit gang. It also greatly strengthened the firm unity of all com

215 NORTHWEST VICTORY AND IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IN THE ARMY 
manders and fighters under the leadership of the Communist Party. On 
this basis, the army achieved greater purity in its ranks, strengthened 
discipline, unfolded a mass movement for training and further developed 
its political, economic and military democracy in a completely 
well-led and orderly way. Thus the army has become united as one 
man, with everybody contributing his ideas and his strength, fearless 
of sacrifice and capable of overcoming material difficulties, an army 
which displays mass heroism and daring in destroying the enemy. 
Such an army will be invincible. 
The spokesman said: It is not only in the Northwest that this 
new type of ideological education movement in the army has been 
carried out; it has been, or is being, carried on in the People¹s Liberation 
Army throughout the country. Conducted between battles, the 
movement does not interfere with fighting. Taking in conjunction with 
the movement for Party consolidation and the land reform movement 
now being correctly carried out by our Party, taking in co-ordination 
with our Party¹s correct policy of narrowing the scope of attack by 
opposing only imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, by 
strictly forbidding beating and killing without discrimination (the 
fewer killings, the better) and by firmly uniting the masses of the 
people who make up over go per cent of the country¹s population, and 
taking in co-ordination with the application of our Party¹s correct urban 
policy and its policy of firmly protecting and developing the industry 
and commerce of the national bourgeoisie, this ideological education 
movement is bound to make the People¹s Liberation Army invincible. 
However desperate the exertions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang 
and its master, U.S. imperialism, against the great struggle of the 
Chinese people¹s democratic revolution, victory will certainly be ours.

Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Liberated Area. 
3 This refers to central Shensi and northwestern Kansu taken together. 
4 Starting from June 30, 1947, 7 columns of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan 
Field Army led by Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping and other comrades forced the

216 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Yellow River and pushed towards the Tapieh Mountains, thus ushering in the 
strategic offensive of the People¹s Liberation Army. By the end of March 1948, 
more than 100,000 enemy troops had been wiped out, and new base areas had been 
built on the Hupeh-Honan border, in western Anhwei, in the Tungpai mountain area 
on the Hupeh-Honan border, the plains between the Yangtse and Han Rivers and 
other places. Eight columns of the Eastern China Field Army led by Chen Yi, Su 
Yu and other comrades, having smashed the enemy¹s concentrated attacks on Shantung 
Province in August 1947, swept into southwestern Shantung and the Honan- 
Anhwei-Kiangsu Border Region, wiped out over 100,000 enemy troops, built the 
Honan-Anhwei-Kiangsu Liberated Area and isolated the enemy¹s strategic centres 
of Kaifeng and Chengchow. Two columns and one corps of the Taiyueh Army of 
the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan area, commanded by Chen Keng, Hsieh Fu-chih 
and other comrades, forced the Yellow River in southern Shansi in August 1947, 
advanced into western Honan, wiped out more than 40,000 enemy troops and built 
base areas on the Honan-Shensi-Hupeh border and in southern Shensi, completely 
isolating Loyang, the enemy¹s strategic centre in western Honan Province, and 
threatening Tungkuan. 
5 Fighting continuously for ninety days from December 15, 1947 to March 15, 
1948, 10 columns and 12 independent divisions of the Northeast Field Army led by 
Lin Piao, Lo Jung-huan and other comrades waged a winter offensive on an unprecedented 
scale along the Szepingkai-Tashihchiao section of the Chinese Changchun 
Railway and the Shanhaikuan-Shenyang section of the Peiping-Liaoning Railway; 
they wiped out more than 156,000 enemy troops and captured the enemy¹s heavilyfortified 
strategic centre of Szepingkai and eighteen other cities. One enemy division 
garrisoning Yingkow revolted and came over to our side. The enemy force defending 
the city of Kirin fled towards Changchun. After this, the area under enemy control 
in the Northeast shrank to only 1 per cent of the whole, and the enemy lairs in the 
cities along the Changchun-Shenyang-Chinchow line were isolated. 
6 From early September to mid-November 1947, 5 columns of the Shansi-Chahar- 
Hopei Field Army led by Nieh Jung-chen and other comrades fought successive 
battles in the area north of the Taching River and in the Chingfengtien area and the 
battle for the liberation of Shihchiachuang, wiping out a total of nearly 50,000 enemy 
troops and linking up the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei and Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan 
Liberated Areas into one contiguous territory. From September to December 1947, 
columns of the Shantung Army belonging to the Eastern China Field Army and 
regional armed forces fought the Eastern Shantung campaign under the command of 
Hsu Shih-yu, Tan Chen-lin and other comrades, wiping out more than 63,000 of the 
enemy and recovering more than ten county towns; this changed the whole situation 
in Shantung Province. From August to December 1947, units of the Eastern China 
Field Army in northern Kiangsu, in successive battles at Yencheng, Lipao and other 
points, annihilated more than 24,000 enemy troops and recovered a wide area in 
northern Kiangsu. In December 1947, units of the Shansi-Hopei-shantung-Honan 
Field Army led by Hsu Hsiang-chien and other comrades fought in co-ordination 
with units of the Northwest Field Army and captured Yuncheng, destroying more 
than 13,000 enemy troops; they wiped out all the enemy forces in southwestern Shansi 
and isolated the enemy at Linfen. 
7 In the spring of 1948, following a period of training and consolidation in the 
previous winter, the field armies of the People¹s Liberation Army launched successive 
offensives. Between March and May, the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Field Army and units 
of the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan and Shansi-Suiyuan Field Armies campaigned in 
southern Chahar, eastern Suiyuan and the Linfen area of Shansi, wiping out more

217 NORTHWEST VICTORY AND IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IN THE ARMY 
than 43,000 enemy troops and recovering much territory. Between March 7 and 
May 29, units of the Central Plains and Eastern China Field Armies fought successive 
battles at Loyang and Sungho and in the sectors west and east of Nanyang, wiped 
out more than 56,000 enemy troops and thus crushed the enemy¹s defence system 
on the Central Plains and expanded and consolidated the Liberated Area there. 
Between March 11 and May 8, the Shantung Army of the Eastern China Field Army 
fought battles first on the western section of the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway and then 
at Weihsien, wiping out more than 84,000 enemy troops. Thus, except for a few 
strong-points, such as Tsinan, Tsingtao, Linyi and Yenchow, which were held by 
the Kuomintang, Shantung Province was liberated. In March the Northern Kiangsu 
Army fought a successful battle at Yilin. 
8 For the ten major principles of operation, see ³The Present Situation and Our 
Tasks², Section 3, pp. 160-63 of this volume. 
9 The Northwest Field Army led by Peng Teh-huai, Ho Lung, Hsi Chung-hsun 
and other comrades employed a main force of 2 columns and 2 brigades, totalling 
more than 25,000 men, in the fighting in northern Shensi in the summer of 1947. 
By the spring of 1948 the main force had increased to 5 columns, totalling 
more than 75,000 men. After having been steeled by a year¹s fighting and by the 
new type of ideological education movement in the army in the winter of 1947, the 
political consciousness of the broad masses of officers and soldiers and the combat 
effectiveness of the military units rose to unprecedented heights. This created the 
necessary conditions for the Northwest Field Army to turn to fighting on exterior 
lines in March 1948. On April 12, following its major victory at Yichuan, the Northwest 
Field Army launched a campaign in Hsifu (the area west of Sian and between 
the Chingshui and Weishui Rivers) and eastern Kansu, pushed forward into the broad 
area between the Chingshui and Weishui Rivers, cut the Sian-Lanchow highway, and 
on April 22 recovered Yenan.


A CIRCULAR ON THE SITUATION* 
March 20, 1948
1. In recent months the Central Committee has concentrated on 
solving, in the new conditions, problems concerning specific policies 
and tactics for land reform, industry and commerce, the united front, 
Party consolidation and the work in the new Liberated Areas; it 
has also combated Right and ³Left² deviations within the Party, 
mainly ³Left² deviations. The history of our Party shows that Right 
deviations are likely to occur in periods when our Party has formed 
a united front with the Kuomintang and that ³Left² deviations 
are likely to occur in periods when our Party has broken with the 
Kuomintang. At present the ³Left² deviations consist chiefly in encroaching 
on the interests of the middle peasants and the national 
bourgeoisie; laying one-sided stress in the labour movement on the 
immediate interests of the workers; making no distinctions in the 
treatment of landlords and rich peasants; making no distinctions in 
the treatment of big, middle and small landlords, or of landlords who 
are local tyrants and those who are not; not leaving the landlords the 
necessary means of livelihood as required by the principle of equal 
distribution; overstepping certain demarcation lines of policy in the 
struggle to suppress counter-revolution; not wanting political parties 
which represent the national bourgeoisie; not wanting the enlightened 
gentry; neglecting the tactical importance of narrowing the scope of 
attack in the new Liberated Areas (that is, neglecting to neutralize 
the rich peasants and small landlords); and lacking the patience to 
work step by step. During the past two years or so, these ³Left² 
deviations have occurred to a greater or lesser extent in all the 
Liberated Areas and in some cases have developed into serious 
adventurist tendencies. Fortunately, they are not very difficult to 
correct, in the main they have been corrected in the past few months, 
or are being corrected now. But leaders at all levels must make 
219

220 MAO TSE-TUNG 
strenuous efforts before deviations of this kind can be thoroughly 
corrected. The Right deviations consist chiefly in overestimating 
the strength of the enemy, being afraid of large-scale U.S. aid to Chiang 
Kai-shek, being somewhat weary of the long war, having certain 
doubts about the strength of the world democratic forces, not daring 
to arouse the masses fully in order to abolish feudalism, and being 
indifferent to impurities in the Party¹s class composition and style of 
work. Such Right deviations, however, are not the main ones at 
present; they too are not difficult to correct. In recent months our 
Party has made achievements in the war, in land reform, in Party 
consolidation, in ideological education in the army, in building new 
Liberated Areas and in winning over the democratic parties; and it 
has emphatically corrected, or is correcting, deviations that occurred 
in these fields of work. This will enable the entire revolutionary 
movement in China to advance along the path of sound development. 
Only when all the policies and tactics of the Party are on the correct 
path will it be possible for the Chinese revolution to win victory. 
Policy and tactics are the life of the Party; leading comrades at all 
levels must give them full attention and must never on any account 
be negligent. 
2. Certain democratic personages, who had believed that a socalled 
³third road²1 was still possible and had placed themselves midway 
between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party because of 
certain illusions about the United States and Chiang Kai-shek and 
because of their scepticism as to whether our Party and the people had 
the strength to defeat all enemies at home and abroad, found themselves 
in a passive position in the face of the sudden Kuomintang offensive; 
eventually, in January 1948, they accepted our Party¹s slogans and 
declared themselves against Chiang Kai-shek and the United States 
and for unity with the Communist Party and the Soviet Union.2 We 
should pursue a policy of uniting with these persons, while suitably 
criticizing their erroneous views. In the future, when the Central 
People¹s Government is formed, it will be necessary and beneficial to 
invite some of them to take part in the work of the government. It 
is characteristic of these persons that they have always been unwilling 
* This inner-Party circular was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Subsequently, the Central 
Committee moved from the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region to the Shansi- 
Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area by way of the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area and in 
May 1948 reached Hsipaipo Village, Pingshan County, in western Hopei Province.

221 A CIRCULAR ON THE SITUATION 
to have contact with the working people, are accustomed to life in the 
big cities and hesitate to come to the Liberated Areas. Even so, the 
social base they represent, the national bourgeoisie, has its importance 
and should not be ignored. Therefore it is necessary to win them 
over. Our estimate is that, after we achieve bigger victories and capture 
a number of cities like Shenyang, Peiping and Tientsin and after 
it becomes perfectly obvious that the Communist Party will win and 
that the Kuomintang will lose, these persons may be willing to come 
to the Liberated Areas to work with us if they are invited to take part 
in the Central People¹s Government. 
3. We do not contemplate setting up the Central People¹s Government 
this year, because the time is not yet ripe. After the bogus 
National Assembly elects Chiang Kai-shek president3 later in the year 
and he is even more thoroughly discredited, after we score bigger 
victories and expand our territories, preferably after the capture of 
one or two of the country¹s largest cities, and after northeastern China, 
northern China, Shantung, northern Kiangsu, Honan, Hupeh and Anhwei 
are all linked together in one contiguous area, it will be entirely 
necessary to establish the Central People¹s Government. The time will 
probably be in 1949. At present, we are merging the Shansi-Chahar- 
Hopei area, the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan area and the Pohai 
area in Shantung under the direction of a single Party committee (the 
Northern China Bureau), a single government and a single military 
command4 (the inclusion of the Pohai area may be delayed for a 
while). These three areas comprise the broad expanse north of the 
Lunghai Railway, west of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway and the Pohai 
Gulf, east of the Tatung-Puchow Railway and south of the Peiping- 
Suiyuan Railway. They are already linked together in one contiguous 
area with a total population of fifty million, and their merger will probably 
be completed soon. This will enable us to give strong support to 
the war on the southern front and transfer large numbers of cadres to the 
new Liberated Areas. The leading centre of the merged area will be at 
Shihchiachuang.5 The Central Committee is also preparing to move 
to northern China, and its Working Committee will merge with it. 
4. Our troops on the southern front have all had rest and consolidation 
from December to February; these troops comprise the 
9 brigades of the Shantung Army, 7 brigades of the Northern Kiangsu 
Army, 21 brigades of the army in the area between the Yellow and 
Huai Rivers, 10 brigades of the army in the Honan-Hupeh-Shensi 
area, 19 brigades of the army in the area between the Yangtse, Huai

222 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and Han Rivers, 12 brigades of the army in northwestern China and 
12 brigades of the army in southern Shansi and northern Honan. 
The only exception was the main force of the army under Liu Po-cheng 
and Teng Hsiao-ping in the area between the Yangtse, Huai and Han 
Rivers, which had had no rest and consolidation because Pai Chunghsi 
concentrated his troops to attack the Tapieh Mountains;6 it was 
not until the end of February that this force was able to send some 
of its units north of the Huai River for rest and consolidation. That 
was our first period of rest and consolidation on a large scale in 
the past twenty months of fighting. During that period the methods 
we adopted were: pouring out grievances by the masses (the wrongs 
done to the labouring people by the old society and by the reactionaries), 
the three check-ups (on class origin, performance of duty and 
will to fight) and mass training (officers teaching soldiers, soldiers 
teaching officers and soldiers teaching each other). By these methods 
we developed high revolutionary enthusiasm among the commanders 
and fighters of the whole army; reformed or weeded out the landlords, 
rich peasants and bad elements found in some army units; 
heightened discipline; clearly explained various policies in the land 
reform and the policies concerning industry and commerce and the 
intellectuals; developed the democratic style of work in the army; 
and raised the level of our military technique and tactics. As a result, 
our army has greatly enhanced its combat effectiveness. Except for 
that part of the army under Liu Po-cheng and Teng Hsiao-ping, which 
is still having rest and consolidation, all our armies in succession have 
started new military operations since late February or early March and 
in two weeks have wiped out 9 enemy brigades. Of our troops on the 
northern front, comprising the 46 brigades of the army in the Northeast, 
18 brigades of the army in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei area and 2 
brigades of the army in the Shansi-Suiyuan area, the greater part fought 
through the winter, while a part was having rest and consolidation. 
Taking advantage of the freezing of the Liaoho River, our army in 
the Northeast fought for three months, wiped out 8 brigades and won 
over 1 brigade, occupied Changwu, Faku, Hsinlitun, Liaoyang, Anshan, 
Yingkow and Szepingkai, and recaptured Kirin. This army has now 
begun its rest and consolidation. Afterwards, it is to attack either 
Changchun or the enemy along the Peiping-Liaoning Railway. The 
army in the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei area has had more than a month of 
rest and consolidation and is moving towards the Peiping-Suiyuan 
Railway. The army in the Shansi-Suiyuan area is comparatively small,

223 A CIRCULAR ON THE SITUATION 
and its main task is to tie down Yen Hsi-shan¹s troops. To sum up, 
we now have two fronts, the northern and the southern, with 10 
armies, large and small, comprising 50 columns of regular troops (each 
equivalent to a Kuomintang reorganized division), or 156 brigades 
(each equivalent to a Kuomintang reorganized brigade), each brigade 
(3 regiments) averaging about 8,000 men ‹ making a total of more 
than 1,322,000 men. In addition, there are more than 1,168,000 irregulars 
(of whom 800,000 are combat troops), including regional formations, 
regional troops, guerrilla detachments, rear-area military organizations 
and military academies. Our entire army thus totals more than 
2,491,000 men. But before July 1946 we had only 28 columns of regular 
troops, or 118 brigades, each brigade (3 regiments) averaging less than 
5,000 men ‹ a total of 612,000; with the addition of more than 665,000 
irregulars, the grand total was 1,278,000. It can be seen that our army 
has grown. The number of brigades has not increased much, but the 
number of men in each brigade has increased very much. After twenty 
months of war, our combat effectiveness has also increased greatly. 
5. From July 1946 to the summer of 1947, the regular army of the 
Kuomintang was composed of 93 divisions with 248 brigades; now 
it has designations for 104 divisions with 279 brigades. Its dispositions 
are as follows. On the northern front there are 29 divisions with 93 
brigades, totalling about 550,000 men (13 divisions with 45 brigades 
under Wei Li-huang in Shenyang, 11 divisions with 33 brigades under 
Fu Tso-yi in Peiping, 5 divisions with 15 brigades under Yen Hsi-shan 
in Taiyuan). On the southern front there are 66 divisions with 158 
brigades, totalling about 1,060,000 men (38 divisions with 86 brigades 
under Ku Chu-tung in Chengchow, 14 divisions with 33 brigades under 
Pai Chung-hsi in Kiukiang, and 14 divisions with 39 brigades under Hu 
Tsung-nan in Sian). On the second line there are 9 divisions with 
28 brigades, totalling about 196,000 men (4 divisions with 8 brigades 
in the northwestern area, i.e., the region west of Lanchow; 4 divisions 
with 10 brigades in the southwestern area, i.e., Szechuan, Sikang, Yunnan 
and Kweichow Provinces; 8 brigades in the southeastern area, i.e., 
the provinces south of the Yangtse River; and 1 division with 2 brigades 
in Taiwan). The reason the number of unit designations of the 
Kuomintang regular army has increased is that after large numbers 
of its troops had been wiped out by our army and after they had 
turned from the strategic offensive to the strategic defensive, the Kuomintang 
felt its shortage of troops acutely and therefore upgraded or 
reorganized many local armed units and puppet troops into its regular

224 MAO TSE-TUNG 
army. Thus, on the northern front, 3 divisions with 14 brigades were 
added to Wei Li-huang¹s command and 2 divisions with 6 brigades 
to Pu Tso-yi¹s command; on the southern front, 6 divisions with 9 
brigades were added to Ku Chu-tung¹s command and 2 brigades to 
Hu Tsung-nan¹s. The total increase was 11 divisions, or 31 brigades. 
As a result, the Kuomintang army now has 104 divisions instead of 93, 
and 279 brigades instead of 248. But, in the first place, the 6 divisions 
with 29 brigades which we wiped out in recent months (up to March 20) 
now exist only in name; there has been no time to rebuild or replenish 
them, and probably some can never be rebuilt or replenished. So, in 
fact, the Kuomintang army now has only 98 divisions with 250 brigades, 
an increase of only 5 divisional designations and 2 actual brigades since 
last summer. In the second place, of the 250 brigades which actually 
exist, only 118 have not received crushing blows from our army. All 
the remaining 132 brigades have been wiped out by our army once, 
twice or even thrice and then been replenished; or they have received 
one, two or even three crushing blows from our army (in the case of a 
brigade, to wipe it out means to destroy it completely or destroy the 
greater part, while to deal it a crushing blow means to destroy one or 
more of its regiments but not its main strength); and their morale and 
combat effectiveness are very low. Of the 118 brigades which have 
not yet received crushing blows, some are composed of recruits being 
trained at the second line and some are local armed units and puppet 
troops which have been upgraded or reorganized; their combat effectiveness 
is very low. In the third place, the Kuomintang armed forces 
have declined in numbers also. Before July 1946 they had 2,000,000 
regulars, 738,000 irregulars, 367,000 men in the special arms, 190,000 
men in the navy and air force and 1,010,000 men in rear-service establishments 
and military academies ‹ a total of 4,305,000. In February 
1948 they had 1,810,000 regulars, 560,000 irregulars, 280,000 men in the 
special arms, 190,000 men in the navy and air force and 810,000 men 
in rear-service establishments and military academies ‹ a total of 
3,650,000. That means a decrease of 655,000 men. In the nineteen 
months from July 1946 to January 1948, our army wiped out altogether 
1,977,000 Kuomintang troops (the statistics for February and the first 
half of March have not been compiled, but the number is roughly 
180,000). In other words, the Kuomintang has lost not only the more 
than 1,000,000 men it recruited in the course of the war but also a 
large number of its original troops. Under these circumstances, the 
Kuomintang has adopted a policy opposite to ours, a policy not of

225 A CIRCULAR ON THE SITUATION 
bringing its brigades to full strength but of cutting down the number 
of men in each brigade and increasing the number of brigade designations. 
While in 1946 the average strength of a Kuomintang brigade 
was approximately 8,000 men, at present it is only about 6,500. From 
now on, the area taken by our army will daily expand, and the Kuomintang¹s 
sources of troops and food supplies will daily contract; we 
estimate that by next spring, after another full year¹s fighting, our 
army and the Kuomintang army will be roughly equal in numbers. 
Our policy is to go ahead steadily and strike sure blows, not to seek 
quick results; all we are trying to do is to wipe out, on the average, 
about 8 brigades of the Kuomintang regular army each month, or about 
100 brigades a year. Actually, since last autumn this number has 
been exceeded, and from now on it can be still further exceeded. It 
should be possible to wipe out the entire Kuomintang army in about 
we years (counting from July 1946).7 
6. At present, there are two sectors on the southern and northern 
fronts where the enemy still has a fairly large striking force and can 
wage offensive campaigns, temporarily placing our troops there in a 
difficult position. The first sector is in the Tapieh Mountains, where 
the enemy has approximately 14 brigades which can be used as a striking 
force. The second is north of the Huai River, where the enemy has 
about 12 such brigades. In these two sectors the Kuomintang troops 
still hold the initiative (they hold the initiative in the sector north of 
the Huai River because we have moved 9 of our crack brigades to the 
north of the Yellow River for rest and consolidation, in preparation 
for use on other sectors). The enemy troops in all other theatres of war 
are in a passive position and are taking a beating. The theatres of war 
where the situation is particularly favourable to us are the Northeast, 
Shantung, the Northwest, northern Kiangsu, the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei 
area, the Shansi-Hopei-Shantung-Honan area and the vast area west 
of the Chengchow-Hankow Railway, north of the Yangtse and south 
of the Yellow River.

2 In October 1947 the reactionary Kuomintang government ordered the dissolution 
of the Democratic League. Under pressure from the Kuomintang reactionaries, 
some wavering members of the Democratic League dissolved it and ceased activities.

226 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Other democratic parties, also being persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionaries, 
were then unable to function openly in the Kuomintang areas. In January 1948 
Shen Chun-ju and other leaders of the Democratic League at a meeting in Hongkong 
decided to re-establish the League¹s leading body and resume the League¹s activities. 
In the same month Li Chi-shen and other members of the democratic wing of the 
Kuomintang established the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in Hongkong. 
Both these bodies agreed with the position of the Communist Party of China about the 
current situation and issued declarations calling for unity with the Communist Party and 
other democratic parties, the overthrow of the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship and 
opposition to U.S. armed intervention in China¹s internal affairs. The wavering 
members of the Democratic League also accepted these slogans at that time. 
3 The Kuomintang reactionaries held a bogus ³National Assembly² in Nanking 
from March 29 to May 1, 1948, at which Chiang Kai-shek and Li Tsung-jen were 
³elected² ³president² and ³vice-president². 
4 In May 1948 the Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area and the Shansi-Hopei- 
Shantung-Honan Liberated Area were merged, and the Northern China Joint 
Administrative Council and the Northern China Military Area were established. In 
August of the same year the Northern China Joint Administrative Council was 
renamed the Northern China People¹s Government. 
5 Shihchiachuang in western Hopei Province was the first major city in northern 
China liberated by the People¹s Liberation Army. 
6 In December 1947 Pai Chung-hsi began attacking the Tapieh mountain area 
with 33 brigades. 
7 At that time the estimate was that the entire Kuomintang army would be wiped 
out in about five years. The estimated time was later reduced to about three and 
a half years. See ³The Momentous Change in China¹s Military Situation², pp. 287-88 
of this volume.

SPEECH AT A CONFERENCE OF CADRES IN 
THE SHANSI-SUIYUAN LIBERATED AREA 
April 1, 1948
Comrades! Today I wish to speak chiefly on some problems 
relating to our work in the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area and also 
on some problems relating to our work in the country as a whole. 
I 
In my opinion, the work of land reform and of Party consolidation 
carried out during the past year in the area led by the Shansi-Suiyuan 
Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China has been successful. 
This can be viewed from two aspects. On the one hand, the 
Shansi-Suiyuan Party organization has combated Right deviations, 
initiated mass struggles and has completed, or is completing, the land 
reform and the Party consolidation among two million several hundred 
thousand people out of the area¹s total population of over three million. 
On the other hand, it has also corrected several ³Left² deviations 
which occurred in these campaigns and has thereby put its entire work 
on the path of sound development. It is from these two aspects that 
I consider the work of land reform and of Party consolidation in the 
Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area to have been successful. 
³From now on,² the people of the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area 
are saying, ³no one will ever again dare to be feudalist, to bully others 
or indulge in corruption.² That is their conclusion about our work of 
land reform and Party consolidation. When they say, ³No one will 
ever again dare to be feudalist,² they mean that we have led them in 
initiating struggles through which the system of feudal exploitation in 
227

FROM MARX



228 
must insist on killing less and must strictly forbid killing without 
discrimination. To advocate killing more or killing without discrimination 
is entirely wrong; this would only cause our Party to forfeit 
sympathy, become alienated from the masses and fall into isolation. 
Trial and sentence by the people¹s courts, a form of struggle provided 
in the Outline Land Law, must be carried out in earnest; it is a 
powerful weapon of the peasant masses for striking at the worst 
elements among the landlords and rich peasants, it also avoids the 
mistake of beating and killing without discrimination. At the proper 
time (after the land struggle has reached its height), we should teach 
the masses to understand their own long-term interests ‹ to regard 
those landlords and rich peasants who do not persist in wrecking the 
war effort or the land reform and who number tens of millions in the 
country as a whole (as many as 36 million out of a rural population of 
about 360 million) as a labour force for the country and to save and 
remould them. Our task is to abolish the feudal system, to wipe out 
the landlords as a class, not as individuals. In accordance with the 
Land Law we must give them means of production and means of livelihood, 
but not more than to the peasants. 
12. We must criticize and struggle with certain cadres and Party 
members who have committed serious mistakes and certain bad elements 
among the masses of workers and peasants. In such criticism 
and struggle we should persuade the masses to adopt correct methods 
and forms and to refrain from rough actions. This is one side of the 
matter. The other side is that these cadres, Party members and bad 
elements should be made to pledge that they will not retaliate against 
the masses. It should be announced that the masses not only have 
the right to criticize them freely but also have the right to dismiss them 
from their posts when necessary or to propose their dismissal, or to 
propose their expulsion from the Party and even to hand the worst 
elements over to the people¹s courts for trial and punishment. 
III. ON THE PROBLEM OF STATE POWER 
1. The new-democratic state power is the anti-imperialist and 
anti-feudal state power of the masses of the people led by the working 
class. Here, the masses of the people include the working class, the 
peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie

229 SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF CADRES 
a most important strategic principle was forgotten, namely, that in the 
land reform we can and must unite about 92 per cent of the households 
or about 90 per cent of the population in the villages, in other words, 
unite all the rural working people to establish a united front against 
the feudal system. Now this deviation has been corrected. Consequently, 
people are very much reassured and the revolutionary united 
front has been consolidated. Secondly, in the land reform work, the 
industrial and commercial enterprises of landlords and rich peasants 
were encroached upon; in the struggle to uncover counter-revolution 
in the economic field, the prescribed scope of investigation was overstepped; 
and in tax policy, industry and commerce were harmed. 
These were the ³Left² deviations in dealing with industry and commerce. 
Now they, too, have been corrected, and so industry and 
commerce can recover and develop. Thirdly, in the fierce struggles 
in the land reform of the past year, the Shansi-Suiyuan Party organization 
failed to adhere unequivocally to the Party¹s policy of strictly 
forbidding beating and killing without discrimination. As a result, 
in certain places some landlords and rich peasants were needlessly put 
to death, and the bad elements in the rural areas were able to exploit 
the situation to take revenge and foully murdered a number of 
working people. We consider it absolutely necessary and proper to 
sentence to death, through the people¹s courts and the democratic 
governments, those major criminals who have actively and desperately 
opposed the people¹s democratic revolution and sabotaged the land 
reform, that is, the most heinous counter-revolutionaries and local 
tyrants. If this were not done, democratic order could not be 
established. We must, however, forbid the killing without discrimination 
of ordinary personnel on the Kuomintang side, the common 
run of landlords and rich peasants and lesser offenders. Moreover, 
in trying criminals, a people¹s court or democratic government must 
not use physical violence. Deviations of this kind which occurred 
in the past year in the Shansi-Suiyuan area have likewise been 
corrected. 
Now that all these deviations have been corrected in earnest, we 
can say on good evidence that the entire work under the leadership 
of the Shansi-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee is on the 
path of sound development. 
The most fundamental method of work which all Communists 
must firmly bear in mind is to determine our working policies according 
to actual conditions. When we study the causes of the mistakes

230 MAO TSE-TUNG 
we have made, we find that they all arose because we departed from 
the actual situation at a given time and place and were subjective in 
our working policies. This should be a lesson for all comrades. 
As for the consolidation of Party organizations at the primary 
level, you have drawn upon the experience of Pingshan County in the 
Shansi-Chahar-Hopei Liberated Area in accordance with the Central 
Committee¹s directive on the work of land reform and Party consolidation 
in the old and semi-old Liberated Areas;1 that is, you have 
invited activists from the non-Party masses to participate in Party 
branch meetings, unfolded criticism and self-criticism in order to 
remove the impurities in the class composition and style of work in 
Party organizations and enabled the Party to forge closer ties with 
the masses. This will enable you to accomplish the whole job of 
consolidating Party organizations in a sound way. 
Those Party members and cadres who have made mistakes but 
can still be educated and are different from the incorrigibles should 
all be educated and not abandoned, whatever their class origin. It 
is likewise correct that you have carried out, or are carrying out, 
this policy. 
In the struggle against the feudal system, the experience of setting 
up people¹s representative conferences at district and village (or township) 
levels on the basis of the poor peasant leagues and peasant 
associations is extremely valuable. The only true people¹s representative 
conference is one based on the will of really broad masses of the 
people. It is now possible for such people¹s representative conferences 
to emerge in all the Liberated Areas. Such a conference, once set up, 
should become the local organ of people¹s power, and all due authority 
must be vested in it and in the government council it elects. The poor 
peasant league and the peasant association will then become its helping 
hands. At one time we thought of setting up people¹s representative 
conferences in the rural districts only after the land reform had been 
completed in the main. Now that your own experience and that of 
other Liberated Areas have proved that it is possible and necessary 
to set up these people¹s representative conferences and their elected 
government councils at the district and village levels in the midst of 
the struggle for the land reform, that is the way you should continue 
to do it. All the Liberated Areas should do likewise. After the 
conferences have been generally set up at district and village levels, 
they can be established at the county level. When people¹s representative 
conferences are established up to the county level, it will

231 SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF CADRES 
be easy to set them up at higher levels. In people¹s representative 
conferences at various levels we must, wherever possible, include 
representatives of all democratic strata ‹ workers, peasants, independent 
craftsmen, professionals, intellectuals, national bourgeois 
industrialists and merchants and enlightened gentry. Of course, it 
should not be done mechanically; we should distinguish between rural 
areas with towns and rural areas without towns, among towns of 
different sizes and between cities and rural areas, so as to fulfil 
naturally, and not mechanically, the task of uniting all democratic 
strata. 
The great mass struggles for land reform and Party consolidation 
have taught and brought to the fore tens of thousands of activists and 
cadres. They are linked with the masses and will be a most precious 
asset of the People¹s Republic of China. Henceforth, we should 
strengthen their education so that they will make constant progress in 
their work. Meanwhile they should be warned not to let success and 
commendation make them conceited and self-satisfied. 
In view of all this, in view of the successes in these various respects, 
we can say that the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area is now more 
consolidated than ever before. Other Liberated Areas which have 
worked along the same lines have likewise become consolidated. 
II 
As far as leadership is concerned, the successes of the Shansi- 
Suiyuan Liberated Area are due mainly to the following causes: 
1. Helped by the work done by Comrade Kang Sheng in 
the administrative village of Hochiapo in Linhsien County last 
spring and summer, the Shansi-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau held a conference 
of secretaries of prefectural Party committees last June. 
The conference criticized Right deviations which had existed in 
past work, thoroughly exposed the serious phenomenon of various 
departures from the Party line and decided on the policy of starting 
the land reform and Party consolidation in earnest. In the main, 
the conference was a success. Without it, land reform and Party 
consolidation on such a scale could not have been successful. The

232 MAO TSE-TUNG 
shortcomings of the conference were that it failed to decide on 
working policies varying with the different conditions in the old, 
semi-old and new Liberated Areas; that on the question of identifying 
class status it adopted an ultra-Left policy; that on the 
question of how to destroy the feudal system it laid too much stress 
on unearthing the landlords¹ hidden property; and that on the 
question of dealing with the demands of the masses it failed to 
make a sober analysis and raised the sweeping slogan, ³Do everything 
as the masses want it done². With respect to the latter point, 
which is a question of the Party¹s relationship with the masses, the 
Party must lead the masses to carry out all their correct ideas in 
the light of the circumstances and educate them to correct any 
wrong ideas they may entertain. The conference only emphasized 
that the Party should carry out the ideas of the masses but neglected 
to point out that the Party should also educate and lead the masses, 
and thus eventually exerted a wrong influence on the comrades in 
some districts and aggravated their mistakes of tailism. 
2. In January this year the Shansi-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau took 
proper measures to correct the ³Left² deviations. These measures 
were carried out after the comrades of the Sub-Bureau 
returned from the December meeting of the Central Committee.2 
For this purpose the Sub-Bureau issued a five-point directive.3 
These corrective measures were so well adapted to the wishes of 
the masses and were carried out with such speed and thoroughness 
that almost all the ³Left² deviations were rectified within a 
short time. 
III 
The line of leadership of the Shansi-Suiyuan Party organization 
during the War of Resistance Against Japan was basically correct. 
This was shown in the reduction of rent and interest; in the substantial 
restoration and development of agricultural production, home spinning 
and weaving, war industries and some light industries; in the laying 
of the foundation of Party organizations; and in the establishment of a 
democratic government and of people¹s armed forces numbering nearly 
a hundred thousand men. All this work formed the basis on which we 
victoriously fought the War of Resistance and repelled the attacks of

233 SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF CADRES 
Yen Hsi-shan and other reactionaries. Of course, the Party and the 
government during that period had their shortcomings; as is now 
entirely clear to us all, these consisted in a certain degree of impurity 
in class composition and style of work, which had undesirable 
effects on our work. But, taken as a whole, the work during the 
War of Resistance was fruitful. We were thus provided with favourable 
conditions for defeating Chiang Kai-shek¹s counter-revolutionary 
attacks after the Japanese surrender. The shortcomings or mistakes 
of the leadership of the Shansi-Suiyuan Party organization during the 
War of Resistance consisted mainly in the failure to rely on the 
broadest masses to overcome a certain degree of impurity in class 
composition and style of work in Party and government organizations 
and the undesirable effect it had on the work. That task is left for 
you to fulfil now. One reason for that situation was that certain 
leading comrades in Shansi and Suiyuan then lacked understanding 
of a number of the actual conditions concerning the Party and the 
masses. This should also be a lesson to the comrades. 
IV 
The task before the Shansi-Suiyuan Party organization is to make 
the greatest effort to complete the land reform and Party consolidation, 
to continue and support the People¹s War of Liberation, to refrain 
from any further increase in the people¹s burden but appropriately to 
lighten it, and to restore and develop production. You are now holding 
a conference on production. For the next few years the aim of restoring 
and developing production will be to improve the people¹s livelihood 
on the one hand and to support the People¹s War of Liberation on 
the other. You have a widespread agriculture and handicraft industry 
as well as some light and heavy industries using machinery. I hope 
you will do a good job in leading these productive enterprises, 
otherwise you cannot be called good Marxists. In agriculture, those 
labour-exchange teams and co-operatives,4 which were in the grip of 
bureaucrats and which harmed the people instead of benefiting them, 
have all collapsed. This is entirely understandable and should occasion 
no regret. Your task is carefully to preserve and develop those labourexchange 
teams, co-operatives and other necessary economic organizations 
that have won mass support and to spread them everywhere.

234 MAO TSE-TUNG 
V 
The national situation is a matter of concern for our comrades. 
Following the Party¹s National Land Conference last year, which 
resolved to adopt a new policy and unfold land reform and Party 
consolidation, large conferences of cadres were held in practically all 
the Liberated Areas on Party consolidation and land reform. At these 
conferences, Rightist ideas existing in the Party were criticized, and 
the serious phenomenon of a certain degree of impurity in the Party¹s 
class composition and style of work was exposed. Afterwards, appropriate 
measures were taken in many areas, and the ³Left² deviations 
have been or are being corrected. Thus, confronted with the new 
political situation and new political tasks, our Party has been able to 
set its work in the whole country on the path of sound development. 
In the last few months almost all the People¹s Liberation Army has 
made use of the intervals between battles for large-scale training and 
consolidation. This has been carried out in a fully guided, orderly 
and democratic way. It has therefore aroused the revolutionary fervour 
of the great masses of commanders and fighters, enabled them clearly 
to comprehend the aim of the war, eliminated certain incorrect ideological 
tendencies and undesirable manifestations in the army, educated 
the cadres and fighters and greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness 
of the army. From now on, we must continue to carry on this new 
type of ideological education movement in the army, a movement 
which has a democratic and mass character. You can see clearly that 
neither the Party consolidation, nor the ideological education in the 
army, nor the land reform, all of which we have accomplished and all 
of which have great historic significance, could be undertaken by our 
enemy, the Kuomintang. On our part, we have been very earnest in 
correcting our own shortcomings; we have united the Party and army 
virtually as one man and forged close ties between them and the masses 
of the people; we are effectively carrying out all the policies and tactics 
formulated by the Central Committee of our Party and are successfully 
waging the People¹s War of Liberation. With our enemy, everything 
is just the opposite. They are so corrupt, so torn by ever-increasing 
and irreconcilable internal quarrels, so spurned by the people and 
utterly isolated and so frequently defeated in battle that their doom 
is inevitable. This is the whole situation of revolution versus counterrevolution 
in China.

235 SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF CADRES 
In this situation, all comrades must firmly grasp the general line 
of the Party, that is, the line of the new-democratic revolution. The 
new-democratic revolution is not any other revolution, but can only 
be and must be a revolution against imperialism, feudalism and 
bureaucrat-capitalism waged by the broad masses of the people under 
the leadership of the proletariat. This means that leadership in this 
revolution can and must be assumed by no class and party other than 
the proletariat and the Communist Party of China. This means that 
the united front of those joining this revolution is very broad, embracing 
the workers, peasants, independent craftsmen, professionals, 
intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie and the section of the enlightened 
gentry which has broken away from the landlord class. 
All these are what we refer to as the broad masses of the people. 
The state and the government to be founded by the broad masses of 
the people will be the People¹s Republic of China and the democratic 
coalition government of the alliance of all democratic classes under 
the leadership of the proletariat. The enemies to be overthrown in 
this revolution can only be and must be imperialism, feudalism and 
bureaucrat-capitalism. The concentrated expression of all these 
enemies is the reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek¹s Kuomintang. 
Feudalism is the ally of imperialism and bureaucrat-capitalism and 
the foundation of their rule. Therefore, the reform of the land 
system is the main content of China¹s new-democratic revolution. 
The general line in the land reform is to rely on the poor peasants, 
unite with the middle peasants, abolish the system of feudal exploitation 
step by step and in a discriminating way, and develop agricultural 
production. The basic force to be relied upon in the land reform can 
only be and must be the poor peasants. Together with the farm 
labourers, they make up about 70 per cent of China¹s rural population. 
The main and immediate task of the land reform is to satisfy the 
demands of the masses of poor peasants and farm labourers. In the 
land reform it is necessary to unite with the middle peasants; the poor 
peasants and the farm labourers must form a solid united front with 
the middle peasants, who account for about 20 per cent of the rural 
population. Otherwise, the poor peasants and farm labourers will 
find themselves isolated and the land reform will fail. One of the 
tasks in the land reform is to satisfy the demands of certain middle 
peasants. A section of the middle peasants must be allowed to keep 
some land over and above the average obtained by the poor peasants. 
We support the peasants¹ demand for equal distribution of land in

236 MAO TSE-TUNG 
order to help arouse the broad masses of peasants speedily to abolish 
the system of landownership by the feudal landlord class, but we do 
not advocate absolute equalitarianism. Whoever advocates absolute 
equalitarianism is wrong. There is a kind of thinking now current in 
the countryside which undermines industry and commerce and advocates 
absolute equalitarianism in land distribution. Such thinking is 
reactionary, backward and retrogressive in nature. We must criticize 
it. The target of the land reform is only and must be the system of 
feudal exploitation by the landlord class and by the old-type rich peasants, 
and there should be no encroachment either upon the national 
bourgeoisie or upon the industrial and commercial enterprises run by 
the landlords and rich peasants. In particular, care must be taken 
not to encroach upon the interests of the middle peasants, independent 
craftsmen, professionals and new rich peasants, all of whom engage 
in little or no exploitation. The aim of the land reform is to abolish 
the system of feudal exploitation, that is, to eliminate the feudal landlords 
as a class, not as individuals. Therefore a landlord must receive 
the same allotment of land and property as does a peasant and must 
be made to learn productive labour and join the ranks of the nation¹s 
economic life. Except for the most heinous counter-revolutionaries 
and local tyrants, who have incurred the bitter hatred of the broad 
masses, who have been proved guilty and who therefore may and 
ought to be punished, a policy of leniency must be applied to all, and 
any beating or killing without discrimination must be forbidden. The 
system of feudal exploitation should be abolished step by step, that is, 
in a tactical way. In launching the struggle we must determine our 
tactics according to the circumstances and the degree to which the 
peasant masses are awakened and organized. We must not attempt 
to wipe out overnight the whole system of feudal exploitation. In 
accordance with the actual conditions of the system of feudal exploitation 
in China¹s villages, the total scope of attack in the land reform 
should generally not exceed about 8 per cent of the rural households 
or about 10 per cent of the rural population. In the old and semi-old 
Liberated Areas the percentage should be even smaller. It is dangerous 
to depart from actual conditions and mistakenly enlarge the 
scope of attack. In the new Liberated Areas, moreover, it is necessary 
to distinguish between different places and different stages. By 
distinguishing between places we mean that in those places which we 
can hold securely we should concentrate our efforts on carrying out 
appropriate land reform work that accords with the wishes of the

237 SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF CADRES 
local masses, while in those places which for the time being are difficult 
to hold securely, until there is a change in the situation we 
should not be in a hurry to start the land reform but should confine 
ourselves to activities which are feasible and beneficial to the masses 
in the present circumstances. By distinguishing between stages we 
mean that in places recently occupied by the People¹s Liberation Army 
we should put forward and carry out the tactics of neutralizing the 
rich peasants, of neutralizing the middle and small landlords, and 
thus narrow the scope of the attack so as to destroy only the reactionary 
Kuomintang armed forces and deal blows at the bad gentry 
and local tyrants. We should concentrate all our efforts on accomplishing 
this task as the first stage of work in the new Liberated Areas. 
We should then advance step by step to the stage of total abolition 
of the feudal system, in accordance with the rising level of political 
consciousness and organization of the masses. In the new Liberated 
Areas we should distribute movable property and land only when 
conditions are relatively secure and the overwhelming majority of 
the masses have been fully roused to action; to act otherwise would 
be adventurist and undependable and would do harm rather than 
good. In the new Liberated Areas the experience gained during the 
War of Resistance must be fully utilized. By abolishing feudalism in 
a discriminating way we mean that we should distinguish between 
landlords and rich peasants, among big, middle and small landlords 
and between those landlords and rich peasants who are local tyrants 
and those who are not, and that, subject to the major premise of the 
equal distribution of land and the abolition of the feudal system, 
we should not decide on and give the same treatment to them all, 
but should differentiate and vary the treatment according to varying 
conditions. When we do this, people will see that our work is completely 
reasonable. The development of agricultural production is 
the immediate aim of the land reform. Only by abolishing the feudal 
system can the conditions for such development be created. In every 
area, as soon as feudalism is wiped out and the land reform is completed, 
the Party and the democratic government must put forward 
the task of restoring and developing agricultural production, transfer 
all available forces in the countryside to this task, organize cooperation 
and mutual aid, improve agricultural technique, promote 
seed selection and build irrigation works ‹ all to ensure increased 
production. Party organizations in the rural areas must devote the 
greatest energy to restoring and developing agricultural production

238 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and also industrial production in small towns. In order to speed up 
this restoration and development, we must do our utmost, in the course 
of our struggle for the abolition of the feudal system, to preserve all 
useful means of production and of livelihood, take resolute measures 
against anyone¹s destroying or wasting them, oppose extravagant eating 
and drinking and pay attention to thrift and economy. In order to 
develop agricultural production, we must advise the peasants to organize, 
voluntarily and step by step, the various types of producers¹ and 
consumers¹ co-operatives based on private ownership, which are permissible 
under present economic conditions. The abolition of the 
feudal system and the development of agricultural production will lay 
the foundation for the development of industrial production and the 
transformation of an agricultural country into an industrial one. This 
is the ultimate goal of the new-democratic revolution. 
You comrades know that our Party has laid down the general line 
and general policy of the Chinese revolution as well as various specific 
lines for work and specific policies. However, while many comrades 
remember our Party¹s specific lines for work and specific policies, they 
often forget its general line and general policy. If we actually forget 
the Party¹s general line and general policy, then we shall be blind, 
half-baked, muddle-headed revolutionaries, and when we carry out 
a specific line for work and a specific policy, we shall lose our bearings 
and vacillate now to the left and now to the right, and the work 
will suffer. 
Let me repeat: 
The revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratcapitalism 
waged by the broad masses of the people under the 
leadership of the proletariat ‹ this is China¹s new-democratic revolution, 
and this is the general line and general policy of the Communist 
Party of China at the present stage of history. 
To rely on the poor peasants, unite with the middle peasants, 
abolish the system of feudal exploitation step by step and in a discriminating 
way, and develop agricultural production ‹ this is the 
general line and general policy of the Communist Party of China in 
the work of land reform during the period of the new-democratic 
revolution.

239 SPEECH AT CONFERENCE OF CADRES 
NOTES 
1 Issued on February 22, 1948, this directive of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China summed up the experience of work in the land reform 
and Party consolidation in various Liberated Areas, laid down a series of policies 
and methods for the land reform and Party consolidation and stressed the correction 
of ³Left² deviations which had occurred during the execution of these two tasks in 
certain areas. 
2 See the introductory note to ³The Present Situation and Our Tasks², pp. 158-59 
of this volume. 
3 This refers to the ³Directive on Correcting Mistakes in the Determination of 
Class Status and on Uniting with the Middle Peasants² issued by the Shansi-Suiyuan 
Sub-Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 
13, 1948. The directive is divided into five sections. The following are its main 
points: 
(1) Because the criteria for class identification had not been well-defined 
quite a few persons were wrongly classified as bankrupt landlords or rich peasants 
on the spontaneous demands of the peasants, and in particular, well-to-do middle 
peasants were wrongly classified as rich peasants. This had an adverse effect 
on the effort to unite with the middle peasants and was wrong. 
(2) Proper measures were to be taken resolutely to persuade the peasants to 
correct these mistakes. Suitable restitution was to be made of property that 
had been taken. 
(3) It was to be explained to the peasants and the cadres that the only 
criterion in class identification should be the relationship of exploitation. Mistakes 
in determining class status were to be corrected. 
(4) The principle of relying on poor peasants and farm labourers and 
uniting with middle peasants had to be grasped. The middle peasants were to 
be enabled to have one-third of the members of the peasant representative conferences 
and of the leading bodies of the peasant associations, and consideration 
was to be given to their interests in taxation and in the land reform. 
(5) Responsible cadres were to make a serious study of the Party¹s class 
policy for the rural areas. Mistakes that departed from the Party¹s policies concerning 
the middle peasants had to be corrected; they had to be corrected through 
the masses. 
Simultaneously with the issuance of this five-point directive, the Shansi-Suiyuan Sub- 
Bureau issued the ³Directive on the Protection of Industry and Commerce² to correct 
the deviations of encroaching on industry and commerce during the land reform. 
4 This refers to the supply and marketing co-operatives.


A TALK TO THE EDITORIAL STAFF OF 
THE SHANSI-SUIYUAN DAILY 
April 2, 1948
Our policy must be made known not only to the leaders and to the 
cadres but also to the broad masses. Questions concerning policy 
should as a rule be given publicity in the Party papers or periodicals. 
We are now carrying out the reform of the land system. The policies 
on land reform should be published in the papers and broadcast on 
the radio so that the broad masses all know them. Once the masses 
know the truth and have a common aim, they will work together with 
one heart. This is like fighting a battle; to win a battle the fighters 
as well as the officers must be of one heart. After the troops in 
northern Shensi went through training and consolidation and poured 
out their grievances against the old social order, the fighters heightened 
their political consciousness and became clear on why they were 
fighting and how they should fight; every one of them rolled up his 
sleeves for battle, their morale was very high and as soon as they went 
into action they won a victory. When the masses are of one heart, 
everything becomes easy. A basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is 
to enable the masses to know their own interests and unite to fight 
for their own interests. The role and power of the newspapers consists 
in their ability to bring the Party programme, the Party line, the 
Party¹s general and specific policies, its tasks and methods of work 
before the masses in the quickest and most extensive way. 
There are people in our leading organs in some places who think 
that it is enough for the leaders alone to know the Party¹s policies and 
that there is no need to let the masses know them. This is one of 
the basic reasons why some of our work cannot be done well. For 
over twenty years our Party has carried on mass work every day, and 
for the past dozen years it has talked about the mass line every day. 
We have always maintained that the revolution must rely on the 
241

242 MAO TSE-TUNG 
masses of the people, on everybody¹s taking a hand, and have opposed 
relying merely on a few persons issuing orders. The mass line, however, 
is still not being thoroughly carried out in the work of some 
comrades; they still rely solely on a handful of people working coolly and 
quietly by themselves. One reason is that, whatever they do, they are 
always reluctant to explain it to the people they lead and that they 
do not understand why or how to give play to the initiative and 
creative energy of those they lead. Subjectively, they too want everyone 
to take a hand in the work, but they do not let other people 
know what is to be done or how to do it. That being the case, how 
can everyone be expected to get moving and how can anything be 
done well? To solve this problem the basic thing is, of course, to 
carry out ideological education on the mass line, but at the same time 
we must teach these comrades many concrete methods of work. 
One such method is to make full use of the newspapers. To run a 
newspaper well, to make it interesting and absorbing, to give correct 
publicity in the newspapers to the Party¹s general and specific policies 
and to strengthen the Party¹s ties with the masses through the newspapers 
‹ this is an important question of principle in our Party¹s work 
which is not to be taken lightly. 
You comrades are newspapermen. Your job is to educate the 
masses, to enable the masses to know their own interests, their own 
tasks and the Party¹s general and specific policies. Running a newspaper 
is like all other work, it must be done conscientiously if it is to 
be done well, if it is to be lively. With our newspapers, too, we must 
rely on everybody, on the masses of the people, on the whole Party to 
run them, not merely on a few persons working behind closed doors. 
Our papers talk about the mass line every day, yet frequently the 
mass line is not carried out in the work of the newspaper office itself. 
For instance, misprints often crop up in the papers simply because 
their elimination has not been tackled as a serious job. If we apply 
the method of the mass line, then when misprints appear, we should 
assemble the entire staff of the paper to discuss nothing but this matter, 
tell them clearly what the mistakes are, explain why they occur and 
how they can be got rid of and ask everyone to give the matter serious 
attention. After this has been done three times, or five times, such 
mistakes can certainly be overcome. This is true of small matters, 
and of big matters, too. 
To be good at translating the Party¹s policy into action of the 
masses, to be good at getting not only the leading cadres but also the

243 TALK TO SHANSI-SUIYUAN DAILY EDITORIAL STAFF 
broad masses to understand and master every movement and every 
struggle we launch ‹ this is an art of Marxist-Leninist leadership. It 
is also the dividing line that determines whether or not we make 
mistakes in our work. If we tried to go on the offensive when the 
masses are not yet awakened, that would be adventurism. If we 
insisted on leading the masses to do anything against their will, we 
would certainly fail. If we did not advance when the masses demand 
advance, that would be Right opportunism. Chen Tu-hsiu¹s opportunist 
error consisted precisely in lagging behind the awakening of 
the masses, being unable to lead the masses forward and even opposing 
their forward march. There are many comrades who still don¹t understand 
these questions. Our papers should propagate these ideas well 
so that everyone can understand them. 
To teach the masses, newspaper workers should first of all learn 
from the masses. You comrades are all intellectuals. Intellectuals are 
often ignorant and often have little or no experience in practical matters. 
You can¹t quite understand the pamphlet ³How to Analyse the 
Classes in the Rural Areas²1 issued in 1933; on this point, the peasants 
are more than a match for you, for they understand it fully as soon 
as they are told about it. Over 180 peasants in two districts of Kuohsien 
County met for five days and settled many problems concerning 
the distribution of land. If your editorial department were to discuss 
those problems, I am afraid you would discuss them for two weeks 
without settling them. The reason is quite simple; you do not understand 
those problems. To change from lack of understanding to 
understanding, one must do things and see things; that is learning. 
Comrades working on the newspapers should go out by turns to take 
part in mass work, in land reform work for a time; that is very necessary. 
When not going out to participate in mass work, you should 
hear a great deal and read a great deal about the mass movements 
and devote time and effort to the study of such material. Our slogan 
in training troops is, ³Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers 
and soldiers teach each other². The fighters have a lot of practical 
combat experience. The officers should learn from the fighters, and 
when they have made other people¹s experience their own, they will 
become more capable. Comrades working on the newspapers, too, 
should constantly study the material coming from below, gradually 
enrich their practical knowledge and become experienced. Only thus 
will you be able to do your work well, will you be able to shoulder 
your task of educating the masses.

244 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The Shansi-Suiyuan Daily made very great progress following the 
conference of secretaries of prefectural Party committees last June. 
Then the paper was rich in content, sharp, pungent and vigorous; it 
reflected the great mass struggles, it spoke for the masses. I liked 
reading it very much. But since January this year, when we began 
to correct ³Left² deviations, your paper seems to have lost some of 
its spirit; it is not clear-cut enough, not pungent enough, has become 
less informative and does not have much appeal for the reader. Now 
you are examining your work and summing up your experience; this 
is very good. When you have summed up your experience in combating 
Right and ³Left² deviations and become more clear-headed, 
your work will improve. 
The struggle against Right deviations waged by the Shansi- 
Suiyuan Daily from last June on was completely correct. In that 
struggle you did a very conscientious job and fully reflected the actual 
situation in the mass movement. You made comments, in the form 
of editorial notes, on the viewpoints and materials which you regarded 
as wrong. There were shortcomings too in some of your later comments, 
but the conscientious spirit was good. Your shortcomings lay 
chiefly in drawing the bow-string much too tight. If a bow-string is 
too taut, it will snap. The ancients said, ³The principle of Kings 
Wen and Wu was to alternate tension with relaxation.²2 Now ³relax² 
a bit and the comrades will become more clear-headed. You achieved 
successes in your work, but there were also shortcomings, mainly ³Left² 
deviations. Now you are making an over-all summing-up and, after 
correcting the ³Left² deviations, you will achieve greater successes. 
When we are correcting deviations, some people look on the 
work of the past as utterly fruitless and all wrong. That is not right. 
These people fail to see that the Party has led a huge number of 
peasants to obtain land, overthrown feudalism, consolidated the Party 
organizations and improved the cadres¹ style of work, and that now 
it has also corrected the ³Left² deviations and educated the cadres 
and masses. Are all these not great achievements? We should be 
analytical with regard to our work and the undertakings of the masses, 
and should not negate everything. In the past ³Left² deviations arose 
because people had no experience. Without experience it is hard 
to avoid mistakes. From inexperience to experience, one must go 
through a process. Through the struggles against the Right and 
³Left² deviations in the short period since June last year, people have 
come to understand what struggle against Right deviations means

245 TALK TO SHANSI-SUIYUAN DAILY EDITORIAL STAFF 
and what struggle against ³Left² deviations means. Without this 
process, people would not understand. 
After you have examined your work and summed up your experience, 
I am sure that your paper will be run even better. You 
must retain the former merits of your paper- it should be sharp, 
pungent and clear-cut, and it should be run conscientiously. We must 
firmly uphold the truth, and truth requires a clear-cut stand. We 
Communists have always disdained to conceal our views. Newspapers 
run by our Party and all the propaganda work of our Party 
should be vivid, clear-cut and sharp and should never mutter and 
mumble. That is the militant style proper to us, the revolutionary 
proletariat. Since we want to teach the people to know the truth 
and arouse them to fight for their own emancipation, we need this 
militant style. A blunt knife draws no blood.

TELEGRAM TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF 
THE LOYANG FRONT 
AFTER THE RECAPTURE OF THE CITY* 
April 8, 1948
Loyang is now recaptured1 and can probably be securely held. In 
our urban policy, pay attention to the following points: 
1. Be very prudent in the liquidation of the organs of Kuomintang 
rule, arrest only the chief reactionaries and do not involve too 
many persons. 
2. Set a clear line of demarcation in defining bureaucrat-capital; 
do not designate as bureaucrat-capital and do not confiscate all the 
industrial and commercial enterprises run by Kuomintang members. 
The principle should be laid down that the democratic government 
should take over and operate all industrial and commercial enterprises 
which are definitely verified as having been run by the Kuomintang¹s 
central, provincial, county or municipal governments, that 
is, enterprises operated wholly by official bodies. But if, for the time 
being, the democratic government is not yet ready to take them over 
or is unable to do so, the individuals previously in charge should be 
temporarily entrusted with the responsibility of management so that 
these enterprises can function as usual until the democratic government 
appoints people to take over. The workers and technicians in 
these industrial and commercial enterprises should be organized to 
participate in management, and their competence should be trusted. 
If the Kuomintang personnel have fled and the enterprise has suspended 
operations, a management committee of representatives elected 
by the workers and technicians should be set up, pending the appointment 
by the democratic government of managers and directors who 
will manage it together with the workers. Enterprises run by 
notorious big bureaucrats of the Kuomintang should be dealt with in 
conformity with the principles and measures stated above. Industrial 
247

248 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and commercial enterprises run by small bureaucrats or by landlords, 
however, are not subject to confiscation. Encroachment on any enterprise 
run by the national bourgeoisie is strictly prohibited. 
3. Forbid peasant organizations to enter the city to seize landlords 
and settle scores with them. Landlords whose land is in the 
villages but who live in the city should be dealt with by the democratic 
municipal government according to law. Upon the request of the 
village peasant organizations those who have committed the most 
heinous crimes may be sent back to the villages to be dealt with. 
4. On entering the city, do not lightly advance slogans of 
raising wages and reducing working hours. In war time it is good 
enough if production can continue and existing working hours and 
original wage levels can be maintained. Whether or not suitable 
reductions in working hours and increases in wages are to be made 
later will depend on economic conditions, that is, on whether the 
enterprises thrive. 
5. Do not be in a hurry to organize the people of the city to 
struggle for democratic reforms and improvements in livelihood. 
These matters can be properly handled in the light of local conditions 
only when the municipal administration is in good working order, 
public feeling has become calm, careful surveys have been made, a 
clear idea of the situation has been gained and appropriate measures 
have been worked out. 
6. In the big cities, food and fuel are now the central problems; 
they must be handled in a planned way. Once a city comes under 
our administration, the problem of the livelihood of the city poor 
must be solved step by step and in a planned way. Do not raise the 
slogan, ³Open the granaries to relieve the poor². Do not foster 
among them the psychology of depending on the government for relief. 
7. Members of the Kuomintang and its Three People¹s Principles 
Youth League must be properly screened and registered. 
8. Plan everything on a long-term basis. It is strictly forbidden 
to destroy any means of production, whether publicly or privately 
owned, and to waste consumer goods. Extravagant eating and drinking 
are forbidden, and attention should be paid to thrift and economy. 
9. Appoint as secretaries of the Party¹s municipal committee and 
* This telegram was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China. Since its contents were applicable not only to 
Loyang but, in the main, to all newly liberated cities, it was sent concurrently to the 
leading comrades on other fronts and in other areas.

249 TELEGRAM TO LOYANG FRONT HEADQUARTERS 
as mayor and deputy mayors only persons who have a grasp of policy 
and are capable. They should train all their personnel and explain 
urban policies and tactics to them. Now that the city belongs to 
the people, everything should proceed in the spirit that the people 
themselves are responsible for managing the city. It would be entirely 
wrong to apply our policies and tactics for cities under Kuomintang 
administration to a city under the people¹s own administration. 
NOTES 
1 Loyang was an important stronghold of the Kuomintang troops in the western 
part of Honan Province. The People¹s Liberation Army first took Loyang on March 
14, 1948, subsequently evacuated the city on its own initiative to facilitate the wiping 
out of the enemy¹s effective strength and recaptured Loyang on April 5. 1948.


TACTICAL PROBLEMS OF RURAL WORK 
IN THE NEW LIBERATED AREAS 
May 24, 1948
It is necessary to give over-all consideration to the tactical problems 
of rural work in the new Liberated Areas. In these areas we 
must make full use of the experience gained in the period of the War 
of Resistance Against Japan; for a considerable period after their 
liberation we should apply the social policy of reducing rent and interest 
and properly adjusting the supplies of seed and food grains and 
the financial policy of reasonable distribution of burdens; we should 
aim our main blows only at the important counter-revolutionaries who 
side politically with the Kuomintang and stubbornly oppose our Party 
and our army, just as we only arrested the traitors and confiscated 
their property during the period of the War of Resistance, and we 
should not immediately apply the social reform policy of distributing 
movable property and land. The reason is that only a few bolder 
elements would welcome the premature distribution of movable property 
and that the basic masses would not get anything and would therefore 
be dissatisfied. Moreover, hasty dispersal of social wealth is to the 
disadvantage of the army. Premature distribution of land would 
prematurely place the entire burden of military requirements on the 
peasants instead of on the landlords and rich peasants. In the sphere 
of social reform, it is better not to distribute movable property and 
land but instead to reduce rent and interest universally so that the 
peasants will receive tangible benefits, and in financial policy we 
should effect a reasonable distribution of burdens so that the landlords 
and rich peasants will pay more. In this way, social wealth will 
not be dispersed and public order will be comparatively stable, and 
this will help us concentrate all our forces on destroying the Kuomintang 
reactionaries. After one, two or even three years, when the 
Kuomintang reactionaries have been wiped out in extensive base areas, 
251

252 MAO TSE-TUNG 
when conditions have become stable, when the masses have awakened 
and organized themselves and when the war has moved far away, we 
can enter the stage of land reform ‹ the distribution of movable property 
and land as in northern China. The stage of rent and interest 
reduction cannot be skipped in any new Liberated Area, and we shall 
make mistakes if we skip it. The above tactics must also be carried 
out in those parts of the large Liberated Areas in northern, northeastern 
and northwestern China which border on enemy territory.

THE WORK OF LAND REFORM 
AND OF PARTY CONSOLIDATION IN 1948* 
May 25, 1948
I 
It is necessary to pay attention to the seasons. In areas designate 
by the bureaus or sub-bureaus of the Central Committee, the whole 
of next autumn and winter, that is, the seven months from this September 
to next March, must be devoted to carrying out the following tasks 
in the proper order: 
1. Make an investigation of rural conditions. 
2. Carry out the initial work for Party consolidation in accordance 
with correct policy. A working corps or working team sent 
by a higher organ to a rural district must first of all unite with all 
the activists and better members in the local Party branch and 
together with them lead the work of land reform. 
3. Organize or reorganize or strengthen the poor peasant 
leagues and the peasant associations and launch the land reform 
struggle. 
4. Identify class status according to correct criteria. 
5. Distribute feudal land and property in accordance with correct 
policy. The final result of the distribution must be such that 
it is considered fair and reasonable by all the main strata and that 
the landlords too feel that there is a way for them to make a living 
and that this is assured. 
6. Form people¹s representative conferences and elect government 
councils at the township (or village), district and county 
levels. 
7. Issue land certificates fixing the ownership of land. 
8. Adjust or revise the rates of the agricultural tax (i.e., public 
grain). These rates must conform to the principle of giving 
253

254 MAO TSE-TUNG 
consideration to both public and private interests; in other words, 
they must on the one hand help support the war and on the other 
get the peasants interested in restoring and developing production, 
which will help improve their livelihood. 
9. Complete the work of the organizational consolidation of 
the Party branches in accordance with correct policy. 
10. Shift our work from land reform to rallying all the rural 
working people and to organizing the labour power of the landlords 
and rich peasants in a general struggle to restore and develop 
agricultural production. Start organizing small-scale work-exchange 
groups and other co-operative units according to the principles of 
voluntary participation and exchange of equal values; prepare seed, 
fertilizer and fuel; work out production plans; issue agricultural 
credits (chiefly loans for means of production, to be definitely 
repaid and to be strictly distinguished from relief grants) when 
necessary and possible; draw up plans, where possible, for building 
water conservancy works. 
This is the whole process of work from land reform to production, a 
process which all comrades directly engaged in land reform must be 
brought to understand so that they can avoid one-sidedness in their 
work and, without missing the seasons, accomplish all the above tasks 
in the coming autumn and winter.
II 
To achieve these aims, it is necessary to get the following work 
done in the next three months ‹ from June through August: 
1. Designate the areas for land reform. Each such area must 
meet the following three conditions: 
a. All the enemy armed forces must have been wiped out 
and conditions must have become stable; it must not be an 
unstable guerrilla zone. 
b. The overwhelming majority of the basic masses (the 
farm labourers, poor peasants and middle peasants), not 
* This inner-Party directive was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

255 LAND REFORM AND PARTY CONSOLIDATION 
just a minority, must already be demanding the distribution 
of land. 
c. Party cadres must be adequate both in numbers and 
in quality to grasp the work of land reform and must not leave 
it to the spontaneous activity of the masses. 
An area where any one of these three conditions is lacking should 
not be designated for land reform in 1948. For instance, since 
they do not meet the first condition, we should not include in this 
year¹s plan for land reform those parts of the Liberated Areas in 
northern and eastern China, the Northeast and the Northwest, 
which border on enemy territory, nor most of the area enclosed by 
the Yangtse, Huai, Yellow and Han Rivers, which is under the 
jurisdiction of the Central Plains Bureau of the Central Committee. 
Whether they are to be included in next year¹s plan will depend 
on circumstances. In these areas we should make full use of the 
experience acquired during the period of the War of Resistance 
Against Japan and put into effect the social policy of reducing rent 
and interest and of properly adjusting supplies of seed and food 
grains, as well as the financial policy of reasonable distribution of 
burdens, so as to unite with or neutralize all social forces that can 
be united with or can be neutralized, help the People¹s Liberation 
Army to wipe out all the Kuomintang armed forces and strike 
blows at the local tyrants who are politically the most reactionary. 
Neither land nor movable property should be distributed in these 
areas, because they are newly liberated and border on enemy territory, 
and distribution there would not be of advantage to uniting 
with or neutralizing all social forces that can be united with or 
neutralized for the accomplishment of the basic task of wiping out 
the Kuomintang forces of reaction. 
2. Make cadres¹ conferences a success. At cadres¹ conferences 
concerned with the work of land reform and Party consolidation, 
all the correct policies relating to these two tasks must 
be fully explained and a clear line must be drawn between what is 
and what is not permitted. All cadres working on land reform and 
Party consolidation are required to study seriously and understand 
fully the important documents issued by the Central Committee; 
cadres must be enjoined to adhere to them all and must not make 
any unauthorized change. In case parts of the documents do not 
suit local conditions, cadres may and should propose amendments,

256 MAO TSE-TUNG 
but they must secure the approval of the Central Committee before 
actually making any change. The higher leading organs of the 
various areas must make adequate and proper preparations beforehand 
for the cadres¹ conferences which are to be held at different 
levels this year. That is to say, before a conference is convened, 
there should be discussions among a few persons (with one of them 
taking the main responsibility), in the course of which questions 
are raised and analysed and an outline is written; this outline must 
be carefully worked out in content and wording (be sure to make 
it clear and concise and avoid long-windedness). Then a report 
should be made at the conference, discussion should be unfolded, 
the outline should be supplemented, revised and finalized in the 
light of the views expressed in the discussion, and the final document 
should be circulated in the whole Party and published, as far 
as possible, in the newspapers. It is necessary to oppose holding 
meetings in an empiricist way, that is, with no advance preparations, 
no problems raised or analysed and no report, carefully 
prepared and well-weighed in content and wording, submitted to 
the cadres¹ conference, but with the participants allowed to indulge 
in pointless, random talk so that the sessions drag on without 
reaching any clear, well-considered conclusion. Pay attention to 
eliminating this harmful empiricist way if it is found in the leadership 
work of any bureau or sub-bureau of the Central Committee, 
or in any area, provincial or prefectural Party committee. Conferences 
to discuss policy should not be attended by too many people 
and can be shortened if there is enough preparation. Generally 
it is proper for a dozen or so people, or twenty to thirty, or forty 
to fifty ‹ the number varying according to circumstances ‹ to meet 
for about a week. Meetings for transmitting policy may have a 
larger attendance but must not last too long either. The only 
conferences which may have a larger attendance and may last 
longer are those for Party consolidation among senior and middlerank 
cadres. 
3. By the first half or at the latest the second half of Septem 
er, all cadres who are to take a direct part in the land reform must 
arrive in the villages and start work. Otherwise, it will be impossible 
to utilize the whole of the coming autumn and winter to 
complete the land reform, the Party consolidation and the formation 
of organs of political power and to prepare for spring ploughing.

257 LAND REFORM AND PARTY CONSOLIDATION 
III 
At cadres¹ conferences as well as in their work, cadres must be 
taught how to analyse concrete situations and how, proceeding from 
the concrete situations in different areas with different historical conditions, 
to decide on their tasks and methods of work in a given place 
and time. Distinctions must be drawn between the cities and the 
rural areas and among the old Liberated Areas, semi-old Liberated 
Areas, areas bordering on enemy territory and new Liberated Areas; 
otherwise mistakes will be made.
IV 
The land problem should be considered solved and the question 
of land reform should not be raised again in areas where the feudal 
system has been fundamentally abolished, where the poor peasants 
and farm labourers have all acquired roughly the average amount 
of land and where there is still a difference (which is permissible) 
between their holdings and those of the middle peasants, but where 
the difference is not great. In these areas the central tasks are to 
restore and develop production, to complete the Party consolidation 
and the formation of organs of political power and to support the 
front. If, in certain villages in these areas, some land is still to be 
distributed or readjusted, the class status of some individuals still 
needs to be revised and some land certificates still have to be issued, 
these tasks should of course be completed in accordance with the 
actual circumstances. 
V 
In all the Liberated Areas, whether or not the land reform has 
been completed, we must direct the peasants to cultivate the wheat 
fields and to plough part of the land this autumn. In the winter, the 
peasants should be called upon to collect fertilizer. All this is vitally 
important to agricultural production and the 1949 harvests in the

258 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Liberated Areas and must be accomplished through administrative 
measures co-ordinated with mass work. 
VI 
It is necessary resolutely to overcome certain manifestations of 
indiscipline or anarchy existing in many places. There are people 
who, without authorization, modify the policies and tactics adopted 
by the Central Committee or other higher Party committees and apply 
extremely harmful policies and tactics, which go against the united 
will and discipline but which they opinionatedly believe to be correct. 
There are also people who, on the pretext of pressure of work, adopt 
the wrong attitude of neither asking for instructions before an action 
is taken nor submitting a report afterwards and who regard the area 
they administer as an independent realm. All this is extremely harmful 
to the interests of the revolution. Party committees at every level 
must discuss this matter again and again and work earnestly to overcome 
such indiscipline and anarchy so that all the powers that can 
and must be centralized will be concentrated in the hands of the 
Central Committee and its agencies.1 
VII 
The Central Committee, its bureaus (or sub-bureaus), the area (or 
provincial) Party committees and the prefectural, county and district 
Party committees down to the level of Party branches must establish 
close contact with each other in order to have a good grasp of trends 
in the various movements, constantly exchange information and experience, 
and promptly correct mistakes and spread successes. For 
these purposes, they should make full use of such means of communication 
as the radio, telegraph, telephone, posts and couriers; of such 
methods of consultation as small meetings (of four or five persons), 
joint local conferences (of a few counties) and personal talks; of such 
inspection tours as may be made by small groups (of three to five 
persons) or by individual committee members with prestige; and of the 
news agency and newspapers. There should be no waiting for several

259 LAND REFORM AND PARTY CONSOLIDATION 
months, half a year or even longer before a lower organization submits 
its summary report to the one above, or before a higher organization 
issues general directives to those below. For such reports and directives 
often become out of date, losing all or part of their usefulness. 
And mistakes are made and cannot be corrected in time, causing 
serious damage. What the whole Party urgently needs is reports and 
directives that are timely, lively and concrete. 
VIII 
In exercising their leadership, the bureaus and sub-bureaus of the 
Central Committee and the area, provincial, prefectural and municipal 
Party committees must give proper attention to both urban and rural 
work, to the tasks of both industrial and agricultural production. 
That is to say, they should not, on account of directing the land reform 
and agricultural production, neglect to give leadership to urban work 
and industrial production or slacken their efforts in this regard. Since 
we now have many big, medium and small cities and a vast network 
of industries, mines and communications, we shall make mistakes if 
any of the leading organizations concerned becomes negligent or 
slackens its efforts in this respect.

and sub-bureaus.


THE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS 
FOR THE LIAOHSI-SHENYANG CAMPAIGN1* 
September and October 1948
I. THE TELEGRAM OF SEPTEMBER 7 
We are prepared to bring about the fundamental overthrow of 
the Kuomintang in about five years, counting from July 1946.2 This 
is possible. Our objective can be attained provided we destroy about 
100 brigades of Kuomintang regular troops every year, or some 500 
brigades over the five years. In the past two years our army has 
annihilated a total of 191 brigades of enemy regulars, an average of 
95 brigades a year, or nearly 8 brigades a month. In the next three 
years it is required that our army should wipe out 300 or more brigades 
of enemy regulars. Between July this year and June next year we 
expect to destroy some 115 brigades of enemy regulars. This total is 
apportioned among our various field armies and armies.3 The Eastern 
China Field Army is required to wipe out about 40 brigades (including 
the 7 already wiped out in July) and capture Tsinan and a number 
of large, medium and small cities in northern Kiangsu, eastern Honan 
and northern Anhwei. The Central Plains Field Army is required 
to wipe out about 14 brigades (including the 2 brigades wiped out in 
July) and capture a number of cities in the provinces of Hupeh, Honan 
and Anhwei. The Northwest Field Army is required to wipe out 
about 12 brigades (including the 1 brigades wiped out in August). 
The army in northern China commanded by Hsu Hsiang-chien and 
Chou Shih-ti is required to wipe out about 14 brigades under Yen 
Hsi-shan (including the 8 brigades annihilated in July) and capture 
Taiyuan. You are required, in co-ordination with the 2 armies commanded 
by Lo Jui-ching and Yang Cheng-wu, to wipe out about 35 
brigades of the 2 army groups under Wei Li-huang and Fu Tso-yi 
261

262 MAO TSE-TUNG 
(including 1 brigade wiped out by Yang Cheng-wu in July) and capture 
all the cities along the Peiping-Liaoning, Peiping-Suiyuan, Peiping- 
Chengteh and Peiping-Paoting Railways, except Peiping, Tientsin and 
Shenyang. The decisive factors for the achievement of this objective 
are the proper disposition and command of troops in campaigns and a 
proper balance between fighting and rest. If in the two months of September 
and October, or a little longer, you can wipe out the enemy along 
the line from Chinchow to Tangshan and take Chinchow, Shanhaikuan 
and Tangshan, you will have achieved the task of wiping out some 
18 enemy brigades. In order to wipe them out, you must now prepare 
to employ your main force on this line, leaving the enemy forces at 
Changchun and Shenyang alone. When you are attacking Chinchow, 
be prepared also to wipe out the enemy forces that may come to its 
rescue from Changchun and Shenyang. Because the enemy forces 
in and near Chinchow, Shanhaikuan and Tangshan are isolated from 
each other, success in attacking and wiping them out is pretty certain, 
and there is also a fair hope of success in capturing Chinchow and 
in attacking enemy reinforcements. If, however, you were to dispose 
your main force at Hsinmin and its northern environs in preparation 
for attacking the enemy forces which might come out from Changchun 
and Shenyang, then the enemy might not dare come out at all because 
you would be too great a menace. On the one hand, the enemy at 
Changchun and Shenyang might not come out. And, on the other 
hand, because the forces you dispatch towards Chinchow, Shanhaikuan 
and Tangshan would be too small, the enemy in and near these 
three cities (comprising 18 brigades) would probably fall back on 
* These telegrams addressed to Lin Piao, Lo Jung-huan and other comrades 
were drawn up by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Revolutionary Military Commission 
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The concept of 
operations he set forth here for the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign was fully carried out 
later. The results of the campaign were as follows: 
(1) The destruction of 470,000 enemy troops, plus the victories in other 
theatres during that period, made the qualitatively superior People¹s Liberation 
Army superior to the Kuomintang army in numbers as well. 
(2) The entire territory of northeastern China was liberated, and the conditions 
were created for the liberation of Peiping, Tientsin and all northern China. 
(3) Our army gained experience in fighting large-scale campaigns of 
annihilation. 
(4) As a result of the liberation of northeastern China, a strategically 
secure rear area with a fair industrial base was won for the War of Liberation, 
and the Party and the people obtained favourable conditions for gradually 
turning to economic rehabilitation.

263 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR LIAOHSI-SHENYANG CAMPAIGN 
Chinchow and Tangshan, and you would find it rather difficult and 
yet necessary to attack them, wasting time and energy and thus perhaps 
landing yourselves in a passive position. For these reasons, it 
will be better to leave the enemy at Changchun and Shenyang alone 
and focus your attention on the enemy at Chinchow, Shanhaikuan and 
Tangshan. Another point: you must prepare to fight three big campaigns 
in the ten months from September to next June and to spend 
about two months on each campaign, making a total of about six 
months and leaving four months for rest. During the Chinchow- 
Shanhaikuan-Tangshan campaign (the first big campaign), if the enemy 
at Changchun and Shenyang sallies forth in full strength to rescue 
Chinchow (because your main force will be disposed not at Hsinmin 
but around Chinchow, Wei Li-huang will be emboldened to come 
to the rescue), then, without leaving the Chinchow-Shanhaikuan- 
Tangshan line, you can follow up immediately with large-scale annihilating 
attacks on the enemy reinforcements and strive to wipe out all 
Wei Li-huang¹s troops on the spot. This would be the ideal situation. 
Hence, you should pay attention to the following: 
(1) Be firmly determined to attack and capture Chinchow, 
Shanhaikuan and Tangshan and to take control of the entire line. 
(2) Be firmly determined to fight a battle of annihilation on 
a scale larger than you have ever fought before, that is, dare to 
fight all Wei Li-huang¹s army when it comes to the rescue. 
(3) In keeping with these two resolves, reconsider your plan of 
operations, make arrangements to meet the military requirements 
The Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign was the first of the three greatest campaigns of 
decisive significance in the Chinese People¹s War of Liberation. The other two were 
the Huai-Hai and the Peiping-Tientsin campaigns. In these three great campaigns, 
which lasted four months and nineteen days, 144 divisions (brigades) of the enemy¹s 
regular troops and 29 divisions of its irregular troops, or more than 1,540,000 men 
in all, were wiped out. During this period the People¹s Liberation Army also 
launched offensives on other fronts, destroying large numbers of the enemy. In 
the first two years of the war, the People¹s Liberation Army had wiped out an 
average of about 8 enemy brigades per month. Now the number of enemy troops 
destroyed by the People¹s Liberation Army no longer averaged 8 brigades per month 
but 38 brigades. These three major campaigns virtually annihilated the crack troops 
on which the Kuomintang relied for waging the counter-revolutionary civil war and 
greatly speeded victory in the War of Liberation all over the country. For the 
Huai-Hai and Peiping-Tientsin campaigns, see ³The Concept of Operations for the 
Huai-Hai Campaign², pp. 279-82 and ³The Concept of Operations for the Peiping- 
Tientsin Campaign², pp. 289-93, of this volume.

264 MAO TSE-TUNG 
of your whole force (food, ammunition, recruits, and so on) and 
to handle captives. 
Please consider the above and telegraph your reply. 
II. THE TELEGRAM OF OCTOBER 10 
1. From the day you start attacking Chinchow, there will be a 
period when the tactical situation will be very tense. We hope that 
you will inform us by radio every two or three days of the enemy¹s 
situation (the strength of the resistance by his forces defending Chinchow, 
the progress of his reinforcements from Hulutao and Chinhsi 
and from Shenyang and the probable course of action of his troops in 
Changchun) and of our own situation (the progress of our attack on 
the city and the casualties sustained in attacking the city and holding 
off enemy reinforcements). 
2. It is highly possible that, as you have said, the tactical situation 
during this period will develop most favourably, that is, that you 
will be able to wipe out not only the enemy¹s forces defending Chinchow 
but also a part of his reinforcements from Hulutao and Chinhsi and 
some or most of his forces fleeing from Changchun. If the enemy¹s 
reinforcements from Shenyang advance to the area north of the Taling 
River just after you have taken Chinchow and when you are thus able 
to shift your forces to encircle them, then it will be possible to wipe 
out these reinforcements as well. The key to all this lies in striving 
to capture Chinchow in about a week. 
3. Decide on the disposition of your troops for checking the 
enemy reinforcements according to your progress in attacking Chinchow 
and their progress in advancing both from the east and from the 
west. In case the enemy reinforcements from Shenyang advance rather 
slowly (as may happen if, during your attack on Chinchow, the enemy 
besieged in Changchun breaks out but is caught and crushed by 
our 12th Column and other forces, in which case the enemy reinforcements 
from Shenyang may be so bewildered as to advance rather slowly 
or halt or turn back to rescue the Changchun forces) while the enemy 
reinforcements from Hulutao and Chinhsi advance rather quickly, you 
should be ready to throw in your general reserves to help the 4th and 
11th Columns wipe out part of the latter reinforcements and, first of 
all, to check their advance. If the enemy reinforcements from Hulu

265 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR LIAOHSI-SHENYANG CAMPAIGN 
tao and Chinhsi are being tied down and checked by our 4th and 11th 
Columns and other forces and therefore advance rather slowly or halt, 
if the enemy forces in Changchun do not break out, if the enemy 
reinforcements from Shenyang advance rather quickly, and if most of 
the Chinchow enemy forces have been wiped out and the capture of 
the city is imminent, then you should let the enemy forces from Shenyang 
advance deep into the area north of the Taling River, so that 
you can make a timely shift of your forces to encircle them and wipe 
them out at your convenience. 
4. You must centre your attention on the operations in Chinchow 
and strive to capture this city as quickly as possible. Even if none of 
the other objectives is attained and Chinchow alone is captured, you 
will have won the initiative, which in itself will be a great victory. It 
is hoped that you will give due attention to all the above points. 
Especially during the first few days of the battle for Chinchow, the 
enemy reinforcements from both the east and the west will not make 
any major moves, and you should concentrate all your energies on the 
operations on the Chinchow front. 
NOTES 
1 The Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign was a gigantic campaign fought by the Northeast 
People¹s Liberation Army in the western part of Liaoning Province and in the 
Shenyang-Changchun area between September 12 and November 2, 1948. On the eve 
of the campaign, the total strength of the Kuomintang forces in northeastern China 
consisted of 4 armies, made up of 14 corps, or 44 divisions. These forces had 
shortened their lines and dug themselves in at three sectors isolated from each 
other, Changchun, Shenyang and Chinchow. With the aim of completely wiping 
out the enemy troops in the Northeast and quickly liberating the whole of the 
Northeast, the People¹s Liberation Army in this region, supported by the broad 
masses of the local people, began the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign in September 1948 
with a main force of 12 columns, 1 artillery column and regional armed forces, 
altogether totalling 53 divisions or over 700,000 men. Chinchow, on the Peiping- 
Liaoning Railway, was the strategic link between northeastern and northern China. 
The enemy forces garrisoning the Chinchow sector consisted of 8 divisions, 
with more than 100,000 men under Fan Han-chieh, Deputy Commander-in-Chief 
of the Kuomintang¹s Northeast ³Bandit Suppression² Headquarters. The capture 
of Chinchow was the key to the success of the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign. Acting 
on the directives of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the Northeast People¹s Liberation 
Army used 1 column and 7 independent divisions to continue the siege operations 
against Changchun; 6 columns, 1 artillery column and 1 tank battalion to surround 
and attack Chinchow; and 2 columns, placed in the Tashan-Kaochiao sector southwest 
of Chinchow, along with 3 columns in the Heishan-Tahushan-Changwu sector

266 MAO TSE-TUNG 
to intercept any reinforcements the enemy might send from Chinhsi and Hulutao 
and from Shenyang to relieve Chinchow. The fighting in the Chinchow area started 
on September 12. Just as our army was mopping up the enemy in the outskirts of 
Chinchow after taking Ihsien, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly flew to the Northeast to 
take personal charge of the operations and urgently summoned 5 enemy divisions 
from the Northern China ³Bandit Suppression² Headquarters on the Peiping- 
Liaoning Railway and 2 divisions from Shantung Province to join the 4 divisions 
in Chinhsi, all these 11 divisions began a furious attack on our positions at Tashan 
on October 10 but could not break through. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang 9th Army 
under Liao Yao-hsiang, with 11 divisions and 3 cavalry brigades, which had sallied 
out from Shenyang to rescue Chinchow, was intercepted by our army northeast of 
Heishan and Tahushan. Our army began the assault on Chinchow on October 14 
and, after thirty-one hours of fierce fighting, completely wiped out the defending 
enemy forces, capturing Fan Han-chieh, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast 
³Bandit Suppression² Headquarters, Lu Chun-chuan, Commander of the 6th 
Army, and more than 100,000 men under their command. The liberation of Chinchow 
impelled part of the enemy forces at Changchun to revolt against the Kuomintang 
and the rest to surrender. The complete collapse of the Kuomintang troops in 
the Northeast then became a foregone conclusion. But Chiang Kai-shek, still 
dreaming of recapturing Chinchow and of reopening the line of communications 
between northeastern and northern China, gave strict orders to the army under Liao 
Yao-hsiang to continue its advance towards Chinchow. After taking Chinchow, the 
People¹s Liberation Army immediately swung back to the northeast and closed in 
on Liao¹s army from the north and south of Heishan and Tahushan. On October 
26 the People¹s Liberation Army succeeded in surrounding the enemy in the Heishan- 
Tahushan-Hsinmin sector and, after stiff fighting lasting two days and one night, 
completely wiped them out, capturing army commander Liao Yao-hsiang, corps 
commanders Li Tao, Pai Feng-wu and Cheng Ting-chi, and more than 100,000 
men. Our army vigorously followed up this victory and liberated Shenyang and 
Yingkow on November 2, wiping out over 149,000 enemy troops. The whole of the 
Northeast was thus liberated. A total of more than 470,000 enemy troops were 
wiped out in the campaign. 
2 See ³A Circular on the Situation², Note 7, p. 226 of this volume. 
3 On November 1, 1948, the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China classified all troops in the big strategic 
areas into field, regional and guerrilla forces in accordance with decisions made at 
the September meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. The 
field forces were organized into field armies. A field army was composed of armies, 
an army of corps (originally called columns), a corps of divisions, and a division 
of regiments. In accordance with their locations, the field armies were designated the 
Northwest Field Army, Central Plains Field Army, Eastern China Field Army, 
Northeast Field Army and Northern China Field Army of the Chinese People¹s 
Liberation Army. The number of armies, corps and divisions in each field army 
differed according to the concrete conditions in each big strategic area. Later, the 
Northwest Field Army was renamed the First Field Army, comprising 2 armies; 
the Central Plains Field Army was renamed the Second Field Army, comprising 
3 armies; the Eastern China Field Army was renamed the Third Field Army, comprising 
4 armies; and the Northeast Field Army was renamed the Fourth Field Army, 
comprising 4 armies. The 3 armies making up the Northern China Field Army 
were placed under the direct command of the General Headquarters of the Chinese 
People¹s Liberation Army.

ON STRENGTHENING 
THE PARTY COMMITTEE SYSTEM* 
September 20, 1948
The Party committee system is an important Party institution for 
ensuring collective leadership and preventing any individual from 
monopolizing the conduct of affairs. It has recently been found that 
in some (of course not all) leading bodies it is the habitual practice 
for one individual to monopolize the conduct of affairs and decide 
important problems. Solutions to important problems are decided 
not by Party committee meetings but by one individual, and membership 
in the Party committee has become nominal. Differences of 
opinion among committee members cannot be resolved and are left 
unresolved for a long time. Members of the Party committee maintain 
only formal, not real, unity among themselves. This situation 
must be changed. From now on, a sound system of Party committee 
meetings must be instituted in all leading bodies, from the bureaus 
of the Central Committee to the prefectural Party committees; from 
the Party committees of the fronts to the Party committees of brigades 
and military areas (sub-commissions of the Revolutionary Military 
Commission or leading groups); and the leading Party members¹ groups 
in government bodies, people¹s organizations, the news agency and 
the newspaper offices. All important problems (of course, not the 
unimportant, trivial problems, or problems whose solutions have 
already been decided after discussion at meetings and need only be 
carried out) must be submitted to the committee for discussion, and 
the committee members present should express their views fully and 
reach definite decisions which should then be carried out by the members 
concerned. The same procedure should be followed by Party 
committees below the prefectural and brigade levels. In the higher 
leading bodies there should also be meetings of the leading cadres in 
the departments (for example, the propaganda department and the 
267

268 MAO TSE-TUNG 
organizational department), commissions (for example, the labour, 
women¹s and youth commissions), schools (for example, Party schools) 
and offices (for example, the research offices). Of course, we must 
see to it that the meetings are not too long or too frequent and they 
must not get bogged down in discussion of petty matters lest the work 
be hindered. On important problems which are complicated and on 
which opinions differ, there must, in addition, be personal consultations 
before the meeting to enable the members to think things over, 
lest decisions by the meeting become a mere formality or no decision 
can be reached. Party committee meetings must be divided into two 
categories, standing committee meetings and plenary sessions, and the 
two should not be confused. Furthermore, we must take care that 
neither collective leadership nor personal responsibility is overemphasized 
to the neglect of the other. In the army, the person in command 
has the right to make emergency decisions during battle and 
when circumstances require.

of the Communist Party of China.

ON THE SEPTEMBER MEETING 
‹ CIRCULAR OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA* 
October 10, 1948
1. In September 1948 the Central Committee convened a meeting 
of the Political Bureau, attended by seven members of the Political 
Bureau, fourteen members and alternate members of the Central Committee 
and ten important functionaries, including principal leading 
comrades in the Party and army in northern China, eastern China, 
the Central Plains and northwestern China. This meeting convened 
by the Central Committee had the largest attendance of any since the 
Japanese surrender. The meeting examined the work of the past 
period and set the tasks for the period ahead. 
2. Since the Party¹s Seventh National Congress in April 1945, the 
Central Committee and the leading cadres of the whole Party have 
displayed even greater unity than during the War of Resistance Against 
Japan. This unity has enabled our Party to cope with many important 
events at home and abroad in the three years since the Japanese 
surrender; and in the course of these events our Party has pushed the 
Chinese revolution a big step forward, shattered the political influence 
of U.S. imperialism among the broad masses of the Chinese people, 
combated the new betrayal by the Kuomintang,1 repulsed its military 
attacks and enabled the People¹s Liberation Army to shift from the 
defensive to the offensive. 
In the last two years of fighting, from July 1946 to June 1948, the 
People¹s Liberation Army has wiped out 2,640,000 enemy troops, 
including 1,630,000 captured. The main war booty of the two years 
amounts to nearly 900,000 rifles, over 64,000 heavy and light machineguns, 
8,000 pieces of light artillery, 5,000 pieces of infantry artillery and 
1,100 heavy mountain and field guns. In these two years the People¹s 
Liberation Army has grown from 1,200,000 men to 2,800,000. Our 
269

270 MAO TSE-TUNG 
regular troops have increased from 118 brigades to 176, that is, from 
610,000 men to 1,490,000. The Liberated Areas now cover 2,350,000 
square kilometres, or 24.5 per cent of China¹s total area of 9,597,000 
square kilometres; their population is 168 million, or 35.3 per cent of 
China¹s total of 475 million; and they have 586 large, medium and small 
cities, from county towns up, or 29 per cent of China¹s total of 2,009 
such cities. 
Because our Party has firmly led the peasants in carrying out the 
reform of the land system, the land problem has been thoroughly 
solved in areas having about 100 million people, and the land of the 
landlord class and of the old-type rich peasants has been more or less 
equally distributed among the rural population and, first of all, among 
the poor peasants and farm labourers. 
Our Party membership has increased from 1,210,000 in May 1945 
to 3,000,000 at present. (In 1927, before the Kuomintang betrayal of 
the revolution, it was 50,000; after the Kuomintang betrayal of that 
year, it dropped to about 10,000; in 1934, as a result of the successful 
development of the agrarian revolution, it rose to 300,000; in 1937, 
owing to the defeat of the revolution in the south,2 it dropped again 
to about 40,000; in 1945, because of the successful development of the 
War of Resistance Against Japan, it rose to 1,210,000; and now, because 
of the successful development of the anti-Chiang Kai-shek war and 
the agrarian revolution, it has reached 3,000,000.) On the one hand, 
the Party has in the past year basically overcome, and is continuing 
to overcome, some unhealthy phenomena which existed to a certain 
degree in its ranks; these were impurities in class composition (landlord 
and rich peasant elements), impurities in ideology (landlord and rich 
peasant ideology) and impurities in style of work (bureaucracy and 
commandism). On the other hand, the Party has in the past year 
overcome, and is continuing to overcome, some ³Left² mistakes which 
accompanied the large-scale mobilization of the peasant masses in the 
struggles to solve the land problem; these were the partial but fairly 
numerous encroachments on the interests of the middle peasants, the 
* This inner-Party circular was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The September 1948 meeting 
was held in Hsipaipo Village, Pingshan County, Hopei Province. This meeting 
convened by the Central Committee had the largest attendance of any since the 
Japanese surrender. Previously it had not been possible to hold such large meetings, 
because the great majority of Central Committee members were in various 
Liberated Areas directing the tense War of Liberation and communications were 
extremely difficult.

271 ON THE SEPTEMBER MEETING 
damage done to some private industrial and commercial enterprises 
and the overstepping in some places of certain lines of demarcation 
in the policy for suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Through the 
great, fierce revolutionary struggles of the past three years, and 
especially of the past year, and the conscientious correction of our 
own mistakes, the whole Party has made a big step forward in 
political maturity. 
The Party¹s work in the Kuomintang areas has been crowned with 
tremendous success. This can be seen from the fact that in the big 
cities we have won over to the side of our Party the broad masses 
of workers, students, teachers, professors, cultural workers, ordinary 
residents and national capitalists as well as all the democratic parties 
and people¹s organizations, and have thus resisted Kuomintang oppression 
and completely isolated the Kuomintang. In several large areas 
in the south (the Fukien-Kwangtung-Kiangsi, the Hunan-Kwangtung- 
Kiangsi, the Kwangtung-Kwangsi and the Kwangsi-Yunnan border 
areas, southern Yunnan, the Anhwei-Chekiang-Kiangsi border area and 
eastern and southern Chekiang), bases for guerrilla warfare have been 
established, and their guerrilla forces have grown to more than 30,000. 
During the past two years and especially last year, we have carried 
out an orderly, well-led democratic movement in the People¹s Liberation 
Army, with all fighters and commanders taking part. In this 
movement we have unfolded self-criticism, have overcome and are 
continuing to overcome bureaucracy in the army and have restored 
the Party committee system at various levels of the army and the 
soldiers¹ committee system in the companies, both of which produced 
good results from 1927 to 1932 but were later abolished. All this has 
greatly heightened the political enthusiasm and consciousness of commanders 
and fighters, strengthened their combat effectiveness and 
discipline and helped us to absorb some 800,000 captured Kuomintang 
soldiers and change them into liberated fighters3 who have turned 
their guns against the Kuomintang. During the past two years, in 
the Liberated Areas, we have mobilized some 1,600,000 of the peasants 
who obtained land to join the People¹s Liberation Army. 
We already have quite a number of railways, mines and industries, 
and our Party is learning on a large scale how to manage industry 
and carry on trade. In the past two years our war industries have 
grown considerably. But they are not yet adequate to meet the needs 
of the war. We lack some important raw materials and machines 
and, generally speaking, still cannot make steel.

272 MAO TSE-TUNG 
In areas in northern China with a population of 44 million we 
have set up a unified people¹s government in which our Party cooperates 
with non-Party democrats. In order to facilitate support to 
the front, we have decided to entrust this government with the task 
of unifying the work of leading and administering the economy, finance, 
trade, banking, communications and war industries in three regions, 
northern China, eastern China (with a population of 43 million) and 
the Northwest (with a population of 7 million), and we are prepared 
in the near future to extend the unification of this work to two 
additional regions, the Northeast and the Central Plains. 
3. In the light of our successes in the past two years¹ fighting and 
of the general situation as between the enemy and ourselves, the meeting 
convened by the Central Committee considered it fully possible to 
build a People¹s Liberation Army of five million in a period of about 
five years (beginning from July 1946), to wipe out a total of some 500 
brigades (divisions) of the enemy¹s regular forces (an average of about 
100 brigades a year), to wipe out a total of some 7,500,000 men of 
his regular and irregular forces and of the special arms (an average of 
about 1,500,000 men a year) and to overthrow the reactionary rule of 
the Kuomintang completely. 
The military strength of the Kuomintang was 4,300,000 men in 
July 1946. In the past two years, 3,090,000 of its men have either 
been wiped out or have deserted, and 2,440,000 have been recruited. 
Its present strength is 3,650,000 men. It is estimated that in the coming 
three years the Kuomintang may still be able to recruit 3,000,000 
men and that some 4,500,000 will probably be wiped out or desert. 
Thus, as a result of five years¹ fighting, the remaining military 
strength of the Kuomintang will probably be only some 2,000,000. 
Our army now has 2,800,000 men. In the coming three years we 
plan to admit into our forces 1,700,000 captured soldiers (estimated 
at 60 per cent of the total we shall capture) and to mobilize 2,000,000 
peasants to join the army. Allowing for depletion, our army, as a 
result of five years¹ fighting, will probably approach 5,000,000 men. 
If five years¹ fighting brings these results, then it may be said that we 
have overthrown the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang completely. 
To fulfil this task, we must wipe out each year about 100 brigades 
(divisions) of the enemy¹s regular forces, making a total of about 
500 brigades (divisions) in five years. This is the key to the solution 
of all problems. In view of the fact that the enemy¹s regular forces 
we wiped out amounted to 97 brigades (divisions) in the first year

273 ON THE SEPTEMBER MEETING 
and to 94 brigades (divisions) in the second year, our targets can be 
fulfilled and even overfulfilled. Of the Kuomintang¹s existing military 
strength totalling 3,650,000 men, 70 per cent are at the fronts (north 
of the line of the Yangtse River and the Pashan Mountains, east of the 
line of Lanchow and the Holan Mountains and south of the Chengteh- 
Changchun line); only about 30 per cent are in the rear (including 
those south of the line of the Yangtse River and the Pashan Mountains 
and those west of the line of Lanchow and the Holan Mountains). 
Of all the existing Kuomintang regular forces, which consist of 285 
brigades or 1,980,000 men, 249 brigades or 1,742,000 men are at the 
fronts (99 brigades or 694,000 men on the northern front, and 150 
brigades or 1,048,000 men on the southern front). Only 36 brigades 
or 238,000 men are in the rear, and most of them are newly formed 
troops of low combat effectiveness. Therefore, the Central Committee 
has decided that during the third year the whole of the People¹s 
Liberation Army will continue to operate north of the Yangtse River 
and in northern China and the Northeast. To accomplish the task 
of wiping out the enemy, it is necessary to utilize large numbers of 
captured soldiers in addition to mobilizing people in the Liberated 
Areas, in a planned and prudent way, to join the army. 
4. Because our Party and our army were long in a position in 
which we were cut apart by the enemy, were waging guerrilla warfare 
and were in the rural areas, we allowed very considerable autonomy 
to the leading organs of the Party and army in the different areas. 
This enabled the Party organizations and armed forces to bring their 
initiative and enthusiasm into play and to come through long periods 
of grave difficulties, but at the same time it gave rise to certain 
phenomena of indiscipline and anarchy, localism and guerrilla-ism, 
which were harmful to the cause of the revolution. The present 
situation demands that our Party should do its utmost to overcome 
these phenomena of indiscipline and anarchy, localism and guerrilla-ism 
and centralize all the powers that can and must be concentrated in the 
hands of the Central Committee and its agencies, so as to bring about 
the transition in the form of the war from guerrilla to regular warfare. 
In the past two years both the army and its operations have become 
more regular in character, but this is not enough and in the third year 
another big step forward must be made. For this purpose, we must 
do everything possible to repair and operate modern means of communications, 
such as railways, highway transport and steamships, to 
strengthen the administration of cities and industry and to shift the

MAO TSE-TUNG 
FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR 
COMMERCIAL 
DISTRIBUTION 
274 
centre of gravity of our Party work step by step from the rural areas 
to the cities. 
5. The task of seizing political power throughout the country 
demands that our Party should quickly and systematically train large 
numbers of cadres to administer military, political, economic, Party, 
cultural and educational affairs. In the third year of the war, we 
must prepare thirty to forty thousand cadres of lower, middle and higher 
ranks, so that in the fourth year when the army advances they can 
march with it and bring orderly administration to newly liberated 
areas with a population of some so to 100 million. China¹s territory 
is very large, her population is very numerous, and the revolutionary 
war is developing very rapidly; but our supply of cadres is very 
inadequate ‹ this is a very great difficulty. In preparing cadres during 
the third year, while we should rely on the old Liberated Areas 
to supply the greater part, we must also pay attention to enrolling 
cadres from the big cities controlled by the Kuomintang. In the big 
cities in Kuomintang areas there are many workers and intellectuals 
who can take part in our work and who have, generally speaking, a 
higher cultural level than the workers and peasants in the old Liberated 
Areas. We should make use of large numbers of working personnel 
from the Kuomintang¹s economic, financial, cultural and educational 
institutions, excluding the reactionary elements. School education in 
the Liberated Areas must be restored and developed. 
6. The slogan of convening a political consultative conference4 has 
rallied around our Party all democratic parties and people¹s organizations 
and all democrats without party affiliation in the Kuomintang 
areas. We are arranging for representatives of these parties and 
organizations to come to the Liberated Areas and are preparing to 
convene a conference in 1949 of the representatives of all China¹s 
democratic parties, people¹s organizations and democrats without party 
affiliation, in order to establish the provisional central government of 
the People¹s Republic of China. 
7. The restoration and development of industrial and agricultural 
production in the Liberated Areas is an important link in supporting 
the war and in defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries. The meeting 
convened by the Central Committee held that, on the one hand, the 
People¹s Liberation Army must develop its victorious offensive into 
the Kuomintang areas and obtain from the Kuomintang forces and 
areas the large supply of manpower and material resources needed 
for the war; and that, on the other hand, in the old Liberated Areas

275 ON THE SEPTEMBER MEETING 
every effort must be made to restore and develop industrial and agricultural 
production so as to raise their level to some extent. Only 
if these two tasks are fulfilled will it be possible to ensure the overthrow 
of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang; otherwise, that will not 
be possible. 
We will have many difficulties in carrying out these two tasks. 
When our armies enter the Kuomintang areas in force to make war 
with no rear area or with no adequate rear area, they will have to get 
all or most of their military supplies themselves on the spot. The 
restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production 
requires good organizational work, good leadership of markets in the 
Liberated Areas, control of trade with outside areas, the overcoming 
of shortages of certain machinery and raw materials and, first of all, 
the solution of the problems of communications, transport and the 
repair of railways, highways and waterways. At present there are great 
difficulties in the economic and financial situation in the Liberated 
Areas. Although our difficulties are much smaller than those of the 
Kuomintang, they do exist. The main ones are that our material 
resources and manpower are inadequate for the needs of the war 
and that inflation has developed to a considerable degree. And one 
cause of these difficulties is the inadequacy of our organizational work, 
especially in the financial and economic sphere. We believe these 
difficulties can be overcome and must be overcome. In the struggle 
to do so, we must fight waste and practise economy. At the front 
we must see to it that everything captured is handed in, must cherish 
our effective strength, take good care of weapons, use ammunition 
sparingly and protect captured soldiers. In the rear we must reduce 
government expenses, reduce the mobilization of manpower and 
draught animals not urgently needed, reduce time taken by meetings, 
observe agricultural seasons so that farm work is done on time, reduce 
costs in industrial production, raise labour productivity, mobilize the 
whole Party to learn to manage industrial and agricultural production 
and carry on trade, make the greatest possible efforts to organize the 
economies of the Liberated Areas properly, overcome disorder in the 
markets and wage the necessary struggles against all speculators and 
manipulators. By getting down to all these jobs, we can certainly 
overcome the difficulties facing us. 
8. Raising the cadres¹ theoretical level and broadening innerarty 
democracy are important links in the fulfilment of the above 
tasks. The meeting convened by the Central Committee adopted a

276 MAO TSE-TUNG 
special decision on broadening inner-Party democracy.5 It also discussed 
the problem of raising the cadres¹ theoretical level and drew 
the attention of all comrades present to the problem. 
9. The Sixth National Labour Congress has been successfully 
held and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions6 has been founded. 
In the first half of next year a National Women¹s Congress will be 
convened to form the All-China Federation of Democratic Women,7 
a National Youth Congress will be convened to form the All-China 
Youth Federation,8 and the New Democratic Youth League will 
be established.9 
NOTES 
1 The first betrayal by the Kuomintang was in 1927. The betrayal here mentioned 
is the all-out counter-revolutionary civil war launched by the Kuomintang after 
the conclusion of the War of Resistance Against Japan. 
2 The defeat of the revolution in the south was the defeat of the Chinese Red 
Army¹s fifth campaign against the Kuomintang¹s ³encirclement and suppression² 
and the withdrawal of our main force from the southern revolutionary bases in 1934; 
this was the consequence of the third ³Left² deviationist line represented in the 
Party by Wang Ming. 
3 This refers to Kuomintang soldiers who were liberated through capture by the 
People¹s Liberation Army and joined its ranks after having been educated. 
4 The slogan of convening a political consultative conference was put forward 
by Comrade Mao Tse-tung. At his suggestion, one of the ³May Day Slogans² 
for 1948 issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stated, 
³All democratic parties, people¹s organizations and public personages should quickly 
call a political consultative conference to discuss and carry out the convening of a 
people¹s congress and the formation of a democratic coalition government.² This 
slogan won an immediate warm response from the democratic parties, people¹s 
organizations and democrats without party affiliation in the Kuomintang areas. 
The political consultative conference was later renamed the New Political Consultative 
Conference and finally the Chinese People¹s Political Consultative Conference. 
See ³Address to the Preparatory Meeting of the New Political Consultative 
Conference², Note 1, pp. 408-09 of this volume. 
5 This refers to ³The Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China on the Convening of Congresses and Conferences of the Party at 
Various Levels². The resolution made the following provisions for the broadening 
and building of regular democratic life within the Party: Party committees at various 
levels should regularly convene Party congresses and conferences at their respective 
levels, as required by the Party Constitution. These congresses and conferences 
should be vested with all the powers stipulated in the Party Constitution, and there 
must be no infringement. Adequate preparations should be made before meetings. 
Inner-Party controversies should be reported promptly and truthfully to the higher 
levels and important controversies must be reported to the Central Committee.

277 ON THE SEPTEMBER MEETING 
The resolution also provided for strengthening the Party committee system and 
required that the rule that important questions must be decided collectively after 
discussion by the Party committee should be enforced by Party committees at all levels, 
that no decisions on important matters should be made by an individual and that 
neither collective leadership nor individual responsibility should be overemphasized 
to the neglect of the other. 
6 The Sixth National Labour Congress was held in Harbin in August 1948. The 
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the unified national organization of the 
Chinese working class, was re-established at the congress. The previous five National 
Labour Congresses were held in 1922, 1925, 1926, 1927 and 1929 respectively. 
7 The First National Women¹s Congress was held in March 1949 in Peiping. The 
All-China Federation of Democratic Women, the leading body for the organizations 
of the masses of women throughout the country, was founded at this congress. It 
was later renamed the National Women¹s Federation of the People¹s Republic 
of China. 
8 The first session of the National Youth Congress was held in May 1949 in Peiping. 
The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth was founded at this session. 
It was later renamed the All-China Youth Federation. 
9 The New Democratic Youth League was founded in January 1949 in accordance 
with a decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Its 
First National Congress was held in Peiping in April 1949. It was renamed the 
Communist Youth League at its Third National Congress in May 1957.


THE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR 
THE HUAI-HAI CAMPAIGN* 
October 11, 1948
Here are a few points for your consideration concerning the dispositions 
for the Huai-Hai campaign.1 
1. In the first stage of this campaign, the central task is to concentrate 
forces to wipe out Huang Po-tao¹s army, effect a breakthrough 
in the centre and capture Hsinanchen, the Grand Canal Railway 
Station, Tsaopachi, Yihsien, Tsaochuang, Lincheng, Hanchuang, Shuyang, 
Pihsien, Tancheng, Taierhchuang and Linyi. To achieve these 
objectives, you should use two columns to wipe out each enemy division, 
that is to say, use six or seven columns to cut up and wipe out the 
enemy¹s 25th, 63rd and 64th Divisions. Use five or six columns to hold 
off and attack enemy reinforcements. Use one or two columns to annihilate 
the one brigade under Li Mi at Lincheng and Hanchuang and 
strive to capture those two towns in order to menace Hsuchow from 
the north so that the two armies under Chiu Ching-chuan and Li Mi 
will not dare move east in full strength as reinforcements. Use one 
column plus regional formation in southwestern Shantung to make a 
flank attack on the Hsuchow-Shangchiu section of the railway in order 
to tie down a portion of Chiu Ching-chuan¹s army (as three enemy 
divisions under Sun Yuan-liang are about to move east, it is hoped 
that Liu Po-cheng, Chen Yi and Teng Hsiao-ping will dispose their 
troops at once to attack the Chengchow-Hsuchow line and so tie down 
Sun Yuan-liang¹s army). Use one or two columns to operate in the 
Suchien-Suining-Lingpi area to hold down Li Mi¹s army. These dispositions 
mean that before the objective of annihilating the three 
divisions of Huang Po-tao¹s army can be achieved, more than half our 
total force has to be employed against the two armies under Chiu 
Ching-chuan and Li Mi to tie down, check and destroy part of them. 
The dispositions should, by and large, be similar to those of last 
279

280 MAO TSE-TUNG 
September for capturing Tsinan and attacking the enemy¹s reinforcements;
2 otherwise it will be impossible to achieve the objective of 
annihilating the three divisions of Huang Po-tao¹s army. You must 
strive to conclude the first stage two to three weeks after the start of 
the campaign. 
2. In the second stage, use about five columns to attack and wipe 
out the enemy in Haichow, Hsinpu, Lienyunkang and Kuanyun and 
capture these towns. It is calculated that by then the enemy¹s 54th 
and 32nd Divisions will very likely have been transported by sea 
from Tsingtao to the Haichow-Hsinpu-Lienyunkang area.3 Altogether 
three enemy divisions will be in that area, including the one division 
already there; therefore we must use five columns to attack them and 
employ the remaining forces (our main strength) to tie down the two 
armies under Chiu Ching-chuan and Li Mi, again on the principle 
underlying the dispositions made in September for capturing Tsinan 
and attacking the enemy¹s reinforcements. You must strive to conclude 
this stage also in two to three weeks. 
3. In the third stage, it may be assumed that the battle will be 
fought around Huaiyin and Huai-an. By that time the enemy will 
have increased his strength by about one division (the Reorganized 8th 
Division in Yentai is being shipped south); therefore we must be 
prepared again to use about five columns as the attacking force, while 
using the rest of our main force to strike at and hold down the enemy¹s 
reinforcements. This stage will also take about two to three weeks. 
These three stages will take about a month and a half to two 
months. 
* This telegram, addressed to the Eastern China and Central Plains Field 
Armies and the Bureaus of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
in those two areas, was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Revolutionary 
Military Commission of the Party¹s Central Committee. The Huai-Hai campaign 
was one of the three greatest campaigns of decisive significance in the Chinese 
People¹s War of Liberation. The campaign was fought jointly by the Eastern China 
and Central Plains Field Armies and the regional troops of the eastern China and 
Central Plains areas. In this campaign over 555,000 Kuomintang troops were 
wiped out. The concept of operations set forth by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in this 
telegram led to complete success; in fact, the campaign proceeded more smoothly 
than expected, and the victory was therefore quicker and greater. After this campaign, 
Nanking, the capital of the reactionary Kuomintang government, became subject 
to direct threat by the People¹s Liberation Army. The Huai-Hai campaign was 
concluded on January 10, 1949, and on January 21 Chiang Kai-shek announced his 
³retirement²; after that, the reactionary Kuomintang ruling clique in Nanking 
fell apart.

281 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR HUAI-HAI CAMPAIGN 
4. You are to complete the Huai-Hai campaign in two months, 
November and December. Rest and consolidate your forces next 
January. From March to July you will be fighting in co-ordination 
with Liu Po-cheng and Teng Hsiao-ping to drive the enemy to points 
along the Yangtse River, where he will dig in. By autumn your main 
force will probably be fighting to cross the Yangtse. 
NOTES 
1 The Huai-Hai campaign was a campaign of decisive importance fought by 
the People¹s Liberation Army over a large territory in Kiangsu, Shantung, Anhwei and 
Honan Provinces, centring on Hsuchow, and extending as far as Haichow in the east 
Shangchiu in the west, Lincheng (now renamed Hsuehcheng) in the north and the 
Huai River in the south. The Kuomintang forces massed in this theatre of war 
consisted of 5 armies and the troops of three Pacification Zones ‹ the 4 armies and 
the troops of three Pacification Zones under Liu Chih and Tu Yu-ming (respectively 
Commander and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang¹s ³Bandit Suppression² 
Headquarters at Hsuchow) and the army under Huang Wei, which was later dispatched 
there from central China as reinforcements. On the side of the People¹s 
Liberation Army, a force more than 600,000 strong took part in the campaign ‹ it 
included 16 columns from the Eastern China Field Army, 7 columns from the Central 
Plains Field Army and regional armed forces from the Eastern China Military Area, 
the Central Plains Military Area and the Hopei-Shantung-Honan Military Area 
(then a part of the Northern China Military Area). The campaign lasted sixty-five 
days, from November 6, 1948 to January 10, 1949; 22 corps, or 56 divisions, of the 
Kuomintang¹s crack forces, comprising 555,000 men, were completely wiped out 
(including 4 divisions which revolted and came over), and 2 armies under Liu 
Ju-ming and Li Yen-nien (reinforcements from Nanking) were repulsed. As a 
result of the campaign, those parts of the eastern China and Central Plains areas north 
of the Yangtse River were almost entirely liberated. The campaign took place in 
three stages. During the first stage, November 6-22, the Eastern China Field 
Army, in co-ordination with the Central Plains Field Army, surrounded and 
wiped out the army under Huang Po-tao in the Hsinanchen-Nienchuang sector east 
of Hsuchow, killing Huang Po-tao and liberating large territories on both sides 
of the Lunghai Railway east of Nienchuang, on both sides of the Hsuchow-Pengpu 
section of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway, and to the west and north of Hsuchow. In 
the Taierhchuang-Tsaochuang sector, 3 divisions of the Kuomintang 3rd Pacification 
Zone, totalling over 23,000 men, revolted and came over to us. During the second 
stage, from November 23 to December 15, the Central Plains Field Army, in coordination 
with the main force of the Eastern China Field Army, surrounded and 
wiped out the army under Huang Wei at and around Shuangtuichi, southwest of 
Suhsien, capturing Huang Wei and Wu Shao-chou, the commander and deputy 
commander of the army; 1 division of this army revolted and came over to us. 
At the same time, our forces wiped out the army under Sun Yuan-liang which 
was fleeing west from Hsuchow. Only Sun Yuan-liang managed to escape. During 
the third stage, from January 6 to 10, 1949, the Eastern China Field Army,

282 MAO TSE-TUNG 
in co-ordination with the Central Plains Field Army, surrounded and annihilated 
in the Chinglungchi-Chenkuanchuang sector, northeast of Yungcheng, 2 Kuomintang 
armies which were fleeing westward from Hsuchow and were commanded respectively 
by Chiu Ching-chuan and Li Mi, under the personal command of Tu Yu-ming. Tu 
Yu-ming was captured, Chiu Ching-chuan was killed and Li Mi barely escaped. 
This marked the successful end of the great Huai-Hai campaign. 
2 ³Capturing Tsinan and attacking the enemy¹s reinforcements² refers to the 
tactics employed by the People¹s Liberation Army during the Tsinan campaign in the 
middle of September 1948. Tsinan, a strategic position of the Kuomintang in Shantung 
Province, was garrisoned by over 110,000 men of the Kuomintang 2nd 
Pacification Zone. In addition, 23 brigades of the Kuomintang¹s main forces, with 
some 170,000 men, which were disposed in the Hsuchow area, were ready to move 
north to relieve Tsinan. Our Eastern China Field Army formed a group of 
7 columns to assault the city and another group of 8 columns to strike at the 
enemy¹s reinforcements. The onslaught against Tsinan started on the evening of 
September 16, 1948. On September 24, after eight days and nights of continuous 
fighting, the enemy garrison was completely wiped out (1 corps revolted and came 
over to us), and Wang Yao-wu, Commander of the Kuomintang 2nd Pacification 
Zone, was captured. Our forces took Tsinan so rapidly that the enemy at Hsuchow 
did not dare to go north to its rescue. 
3 In fact, these 2 enemy divisions did not dare to come.

REVOLUTIONARY FORCES OF THE WORLD UNITE, 
FIGHT AGAINST IMPERIALIST AGGRESSION!* 
November 1948
At this time, when the awakened working class and all genuine 
revolutionaries of the world are jubilantly celebrating the thirty-first 
anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution of the Soviet 
Union, I recall a well-known article by Stalin, written in 1918 on the 
first anniversary of that revolution. In that article Stalin said: 
The great world-wide significance of the October Revolution 
chiefly consists in the fact that: 
1) It has widened the scope of the national question and 
converted it from the particular question of combating national 
oppression in Europe into the general question of emancipating 
the oppressed peoples, colonies and semi-colonies from imperialism; 
2) It has opened up wide possibilities for their emancipation 
and the right paths towards it, has thereby greatly facilitated the 
cause of the emancipation of the oppressed peoples of the West 
and the East, and has drawn them into the common current of 
the victorious struggle against imperialism; 
3) It has thereby erected a bridge between the socialist West 
and the enslaved East, having created a new front of revolutions 
against world imperialism, extending from the proletarians of the 
West, through the Russian revolution, to the oppressed peoples of 
the East.1 
History has developed in the direction pointed out by Stalin. The 
October Revolution has opened up wide possibilities for the emancipation 
of the peoples of the world and opened up the realistic paths 
towards it; it has created a new front of revolutions against world 
imperialism, extending from the proletarians of the West, through the 
Russian revolution, to the oppressed peoples of the East. This front 
283

284 MAO TSE-TUNG 
of revolutions has been created and developed under the brilliant 
guidance of Lenin and, after Lenin¹s death, of Stalin. 
If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party. 
Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the Marxist- 
Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary 
style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses 
of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs. In the 
more than one hundred years since the birth of Marxism, it was only 
through the example of the Russian Bolsheviks in leading the October 
Revolution, in leading socialist construction and in defeating fascist 
aggression that revolutionary parties of a new type were formed and 
developed in the world. With the birth of revolutionary parties of 
this type, the face of the world revolution has changed. The change 
has been so great that transformations utterly inconceivable to people 
of the older generation have come into being amid fire and thunder. 
The Communist Party of China is a party built and developed on the 
model of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. With the birth 
of the Communist Party of China, the face of the Chinese revolution 
took on an altogether new aspect. Is this fact not clear enough? 
The world revolutionary united front, with the Soviet Union at its 
head, defeated fascist Germany, Italy and Japan. This was a result 
of the October Revolution. If there had been no October Revolution, 
if there had been no Communist Party of the Soviet Union, no Soviet 
Union and no anti-imperialist revolutionary united front in the West 
and in the East led by the Soviet Union, could one conceive of victory 
over fascist Germany, Italy, Japan and their running dogs? If the 
October Revolution opened up wide possibilities for the emancipation 
of the working class and the oppressed peoples of the world and 
opened up realistic paths towards it, then the victory of the antifascist 
Second World War has opened up still wider possibilities for 
the emancipation of the working class and the oppressed peoples of 
the world and has opened up still more realistic paths towards it. It 
will be a very great mistake to underestimate the significance of the 
victory of World War II. 
Since the victory of World War II, U.S. imperialism and its running 
dogs in various countries have taken the place of fascist Germany, 
* This article was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in commemoration of the 
thirty-first anniversary of the October Revolution for the organ of the Information 
Bureau of the Communist and Workers¹ Parties of Europe, For A Lasting Peace, 
For A People¹s Democracy. It appeared in the 21st issue of the publication in 1948.

285 REVOLUTIONARY FORCES OF THE WORLD UNITE! 
Italy and Japan and are frantically preparing a new world war and 
menacing the whole world; this reflects the utter decay of the capitalist 
world and its fear of imminent doom. This enemy still has strength; 
therefore, all the revolutionary forces of each country must unite, and 
the revolutionary forces of all countries must likewise unite, must 
form an anti-imperialist united front headed by the Soviet Union and 
follow correct policies; otherwise, victory will be impossible. This 
enemy has a weak and fragile foundation, he is disintegrating internally, 
he is alienated from the people, he is confronted with inextricable 
economic crises; therefore, he can be defeated. It will be a very 
great mistake to overestimate the enemy¹s strength and underestimate 
the strength of the revolutionary forces. 
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, tremendous 
victories have now been won in the great Chinese people¹s democratic 
revolution directed against the frenzied aggression of U.S. imperialism 
in China and against the traitorous, dictatorial and reactionary Kuomintang 
government that has been slaughtering the Chinese people by 
civil war. During the two years from July 1946 to June 1948, the 
People¹s Liberation Army led by the Communist Party of China beat 
back the attacks of 4,300,000 troops of the reactionary Kuomintang 
government and went over from the defensive to the offensive. During 
those two years of fighting (not including developments since July 
1948), the People¹s Liberation Army captured and wiped out 2,640,000 
Kuomintang troops. China¹s Liberated Areas now cover 2,350,000 
square kilometres, or 24.5 per cent of the country¹s 9,597,000 square 
kilometres; they have a population of 168 million, or 35.3 per cent of 
the country¹s 475 million; and they contain 586 cities and towns, or 29 
per cent of the 2,009 in the whole country. Because our Party has 
resolutely led the peasants to carry out the reform of the land system, 
the land problem has been thoroughly solved in areas with a population 
of about 100 million, and the land of the landlords and old-type rich 
peasants has been more or less equally distributed among the peasants, 
primarily among the poor peasants and farm labourers. The membership 
of the Communist Party of China has grown from 1,210,000 in 1945 
to 3,000,000 today. The task of the Communist Party of China is to 
unite the revolutionary forces of the whole country to drive out the aggressive 
forces of U.S. imperialism, overthrow the reactionary rule of the 
Kuomintang and establish a united, democratic people¹s republic. We 
know that there are still many difficulties ahead. But we are not afraid 
of them. We believe that difficulties must be and can be overcome.

286 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The radiance of the October Revolution shines upon us. The longsuffering 
Chinese people must win their liberation, and they firmly 
believe they can. Always isolated in the past, China¹s revolutionary 
struggle no longer feels isolated since the victory of the October 
Revolution. We enjoy the support of the Communist Parties and the 
working class of the world. This point was understood by Dr. Sun 
Yat-sen, forerunner of the Chinese revolution, who established the 
policy of alliance with the Soviet Union against imperialism. On his 
death-bed he wrote a letter to the Soviet Union as part of his testament. 
It is the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of the Kuomintang that is 
betraying Sun Yat-sen¹s policy, standing on the side of the imperialist 
counter-revolutionary front and opposing the people of their own 
country. But before long, people will witness the complete destruction 
of the whole reactionary regime of the Kuomintang by the Chinese 
people. The Chinese people are brave, so is the Communist Party of 
China, and they are determined to liberate all China.

THE MOMENTOUS CHANGE IN CHINA¹S 
MILITARY SITUATION* 
November 14, 1948
The military situation in China has reached a new turning point 
and the balance of forces between the two sides in the war has 
undergone a fundamental change. The People¹s Liberation Army, 
long superior in quality, has now become superior in numbers as well. 
This is a sign that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the 
realization of peace in China are at hand. 
At the end of the second year of the war, that is, at the end of 
June this year, the Kuomintang army still had a total of some 3,650,000 
men. This was 650,000 less than the 4,300,000 men the Kuomintang 
had in July 1946 when it started the country-wide civil war. The 
Kuomintang recruited about 2,440,000 men during the two years of 
war, which is the reason why the decrease was only 650,000, although 
in that period approximately 3,090,000 were wiped out or captured, or 
deserted (2,640,000 were wiped out or captured). Recently a sudden 
change took place. In the first four months of the third year of the 
war, from July 1 to November 2 when Shenyang was liberated, the 
Kuomintang army lost 1,000,000 men. Its replacements during these 
four months have not yet been ascertained; supposing it was able to 
recruit 300,000 men, then the net decrease would be 700,000. Thus 
the whole of the Kuomintang¹s armed forces ‹ army, navy and air 
force, regulars and irregulars, combat troops and men in the rearervice 
establishments ‹ are now only some 2,900,000. On the other 
hand, the People¹s Liberation Army, which had 1,200,000 men in 
June 1946, grew to 2,800,000 in June 1948 and has now increased to 
more than 3,000,000. Thus, the numerical superiority long enjoyed 
by the Kuomintang army has rapidly turned into inferiority. This is 
the result of heroic fighting by the People¹s Liberation Army during 
the past four months in all the war theatres of the country; it is 
especially the result of the Sui-Ki and Tsinan campaigns1 on the southern 
front and of the Chinchow, Changchun, Liaohsi and Shenyang 
287

288 MAO TSE-TUNG 
campaigns2 on the northern front. Up to the end of June this year, 
the Kuomintang still had designations for 285 divisions because it had 
frantically incorporated its irregulars into its regular forces. In these 
four months, the battalions and larger units wiped out by the People¹s 
Liberation Army totalled 83 divisions, including 63 whole divisions. 
Accordingly, the war will be much shorter than we originally 
estimated. The original estimate was that the reactionary Kuomintang 
government could be completely overthrown in about five years, 
beginning from July 1946. As we now see it, only another year or so 
may be needed to overthrow it completely. A longer time will be 
needed, however, to eliminate the reactionary forces in all parts of the 
country and complete the liberation of the people. 
The enemy is collapsing rapidly, but the Communists, the People¹s 
Liberation Army and people of all walks of life throughout the country 
must continue to unite as one man and redouble their efforts; only 
thus can we finally and completely wipe out the reactionary forces and 
build a united, democratic people¹s republic in the whole country. 
NOTES 
1 The Sui-Ki campaign, also known as the Eastern Honan campaign, was 
fought by the People¹s Liberation Army in the sector comprising Kaifeng, Suihsien 
and Kihsien. The campaign started on June 17, 1948. On June 22 our army 
captured Kaifeng. To save his critical military situation, Chiang Kai-shek went 
to the front, took personal command and mustered 3 armies under Chiu Ching-chuan, 
Ou Shou-nien and Huang Po-tao to start an attack on Kaifeng from several directions. 
Six columns of our Eastern China Field Army, 2 columns of our Central Plains Field 
Army and our Kwangtung-Kwangsi Column surrounded the armies under Ou Shou-nien 
and Huang Po-tao in the Suihsien-Kihsien sector and, after nine days and nights 
of fierce fighting (June 27-July 6), they wiped out 2 divisions, or 6 brigades, 
of Ou Shou-nien¹s army and a part of Huang Po-tao¹s army, a total of over 90,000 
men. Ou Shou-nien, army commander, and Shen Cheng-nien, Commander of the 
Reorganized 75th Division, were captured. For the Tsinan campaign, see ³The 
Concept of Operations for the Huai-Hai Campaign², Note 2, p. 282 of this volume. 
2 The Chinchow, Changchun, Liaohsi and Shenyang campaigns in northeastern 
China, taken together, were called the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign. See ³The Concept 
of Operations for the Liaohsi-Shenyang Campaign², Note 1, pp. 265-66 of this volume. 
* This commentary was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Hsinhua 
News Agency. Here Comrade Mao Tse-tung, basing himself on the new situation, 
that is, the change in the relation of forces between the enemy and ourselves after 
the Liaohsi-Shenyang campaign, made a new estimate of the time needed to win 
victory in the People¹s War of Liberation and pointed out that the reactionary rule 
of the Kuomintang could be overthrown in no more than a year from November 1948. 
Subsequent developments in China¹s military situation fully confirmed his prediction.

THE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS 
FOR THE PEIPING-TIENTSIN CAMPAIGN1* 
December 11, 1948
1. The enemy forces in Changchiakou, Hsinpao-an and Huailai 
and in the entire area of Peiping, Tientsin, Tangku and Tangshan ‹ 
except a few units, such as certain divisions of the 35th, 62nd and 94th 
Corps, which still have a fairly high combat effectiveness for the 
defence of fortified positions ‹ have little offensive spirit; they are 
like birds startled by the mere twang of a bow-string. This is especially 
the case since you advanced south of the Great Wall. You should 
on no account overrate the enemy¹s combat effectiveness. Some of 
our comrades have suffered through overrating the enemy¹s combat 
effectiveness, but they have arrived at a correct understanding after 
being criticized. The enemy at both Changchiakou and Hsinpao-an 
is definitely encircled and will in all probability find it extremely difficult 
to break through and escape. About half the 16th Corps has 
been speedily wiped out. The enemy¹s 104th Corps at Huailai has 
hurriedly fled south and will probably be wiped out today or tomorrow. 
After that is done, you will be ready to dispatch the 4th Column 
from the southwest2 to the northeast to cut the link between Nankow 
and Peiping. We think this may not be easy to accomplish; for, either 
the remnants of the 94th and 16th Corps will quickly withdraw to 
Peiping, or the 94th, 16th and 92nd Corps will concentrate in the 
Nankow-Changping-Shahochen region for joint defence. But this 
move by our 4th Column will directly menace the northwestern and 
northern suburbs of Peiping and tie down those enemy forces so that 
they dare not move. If they should dare to move further west to 
reinforce the 35th Corps, we could either directly cut off their retreat 
or launch a direct attack on Peiping; therefore they will probably not 
dare to move further west. The army in northern China commanded 
by Yang Teh-chih, Lo Jui-ching and Keng Piao is employing 9 divisions 
289

290 MAO TSE-TUNG 
to encircle 3 divisions of the enemy¹s 35th Corps; this is absolute superiority. 
They have proposed to wipe out these enemy divisions at an 
early date, but we intend to ask them not to attack for the time being 
so as to lure the enemy at Peiping and Tientsin and make it difficult 
for him to come to a decision to flee by sea. They have employed 2 
columns to encircle the 35th Corps and 1 column to check the 104th 
Corps and have beaten back both these enemy forces. 
2. We now agree to your sending the 5th Column immediately 
to the vicinity of Nankow to menace the enemy at Peiping, Nankow 
and Huaijou from the northeast. This column will remain there so 
that later (in about ten or fifteen days, that is, when the army in 
northern China commanded by Yang Teh-chih, Lo Jui-ching and Keng 
Piao has annihilated the 35th Corps) your 4th Column can be released 
for service in the east. Therefore, please order the 5th Column to 
continue its march west today. 
3. The 3rd Column should on no account go to Nankow but, in 
accordance with our telegram of the 9th, should move to the region 
east of Peiping and south of Tunghsien to threaten Peiping from the 
east and, together with the 4th, 11th and 5th Columns, form an encirclement 
around Peiping. 
4. But our real aim is not to encircle Peiping first but rather to 
encircle Tientsin, Tangku, Lutai and Tangshan first. 
5. We estimate that your 10th, 9th, 6th and 8th Columns, your 
Artillery Column and your 7th Column will have assembled in the 
region around Yutien by about December 15. We propose that, in the 
few days between December 20 and 25, you move with lightning speed 
and employ the 6 columns ‹ the 3rd (which is to march east from the 
eastern suburbs of Peiping), the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th ‹ to encircle 
the enemy at Tientsin, Tangku, Lutai and Tangshan, provided that the 
enemy¹s situation at those points remains roughly the same as now. 
The method is to place 2 columns around Wuching ‹ at Langfang, 
Hohsiwu and Yangtsun ‹ and to use 5 columns as wedges to be driven 
* This was a telegram drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Revolutionary 
Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
and addressed to Lin Piao, Lo Jung-huan and other comrades. The Peiping-Tientsin 
campaign was the last of the three greatest campaigns of decisive significance in 
the Chinese People¹s War of Liberation. In this campaign, we wiped out or reorganized 
over 520,000 Kuomintang troops, liberated the important cities of Peiping, 
Tientsin and Changchiakou and concluded, in the main, the fighting for the liberation 
of northern China. The concept of operations for the campaign, set forth here by 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung, was fully realized in practice.

291 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR PEIPING-TIENTSIN CAMPAIGN 
between enemy positions at Tientsin, Tangku, Lutai, Tangshan and 
Kuyeh and so cut off contacts between the enemy forces. All these 
columns should build two-way blocking positions to ensure that the 
enemy cannot escape. Then they should rest and consolidate their 
troops and, after recovering from fatigue, attack and wipe out some 
small enemy groups. In the meantime the 4th Column should move 
from northwest to east of Peiping. Before the 4th Column starts to 
move, the army in northern China commanded by Yang Teh-chih, Lo 
Jui-ching and Keng Piao should wipe out the enemy in Hsinpao-an. 
In the east, according to circumstances, every effort should be made to 
wipe out the enemy in Tangku first and control that seaport. If these 
two points, Tangku (the most important) and Hsinpao-an, are captured, 
you will have the initiative on the whole chessboard. The above 
dispositions constitute, in reality, the wholesale encirclement of the 
enemy in Changchiakou, Hsinpao-an, Nankow, Peiping, Huaijou, 
Shunyi, Tunghsien, Wanping (Chohsien and Lianghsiang have been 
captured), Fengtai, Tientsin, Tangku, Lutai, Tangshan and Kaiping. 
6. This method is generally the same as that you used in the 
fighting along the line through Ihsien, Chinchow, Chinhsi, Hsingcheng, 
Suichung, Shanhaikuan and Luanhsien.3 
7. In the two weeks beginning from today (December 11-25), the 
basic principle is to encircle without attacking (in the case of Changchiakou 
and Hsinpao-an) and, in some cases, to cut off without encircling 
(in the case of Peiping, Tientsin and Tungchow, to make only 
a strategic encirclement and cut the links between the enemy forces, 
but not to make a tactical encirclement) in order to wait for the completion 
of our dispositions and then wipe out the enemy forces one 
by one. In particular, you must not wipe out all the enemy forces 
at Changchiakou, Hsinpao-an and Nankow because that would compel 
the enemy east of Nankow to make a quick decision to bolt. Please 
make sure you understand this point. 
8. In order not to prompt Chiang Kai-shek quickly to decide to 
ship his troops in the Peiping-Tientsin area south by sea, we are going 
to order Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping, Chen Yi and Su Yu, after 
they have wiped out Huang Wei¹s army, to spare the remainder of 
Tu Yu-ming¹s armies under Chiu Ching-chuan, Li Mi and Sun Yuanliang 
(about half of which have already been destroyed) and for two 
weeks to make no dispositions for their final annihilation. 
9. To prevent the enemy from fleeing towards Tsingtao, we are 
going to order our troops in Shantung to mass certain forces to control

292 MAO TSE-TUNG 
a section of the Yellow River near Tsinan and to make preparations 
along the Tsingtao-Tsinan Railway. 
10. There is little or no possibility that the enemy will flee towards 
Hsuchow, Chengchow, Sian or Suiyuan. 
11. The main or the only concern is that the enemy might flee by 
sea. Therefore, in the coming two weeks the general method should 
be to encircle without attacking or to cut off without encircling. 
12. This plan is beyond the enemy¹s range of expectation, and it 
will be very difficult for him to discern it before you complete your final 
dispositions. At present, the enemy is probably calculating that you 
will attack Peiping. 
13. The enemy always underrates the energy of our army and 
overrates his own strength, though at the same time he is like a bird 
startled by the mere twang of a bow-string. The enemy at Peiping 
and Tientsin will never expect you to be able to complete the above 
dispositions by December 25. 
14. In order to complete these dispositions by December 25, you 
should inspire your troops in the next two weeks to ignore fatigue, 
to have no fear of depletion of numbers and have no fear of cold and 
hunger; after these dispositions have been made, they can rest and 
consolidate and take their time in attacking. 
15. The sequence of attacks will be roughly the following: first, 
the Tangku-Lutai sector; second, Hsinpao-an; third, the Tangshan 
sector; fourth, the Tientsin and Changchiakou sectors; and, lastly, the 
Peiping sector. 
16. What are your views on this plan? What are its shortcomings? 
Are there any difficulties in its execution? Please consider 
all this and reply by telegraph. 
NOTES 
1 The Peiping-Tientsin campaign, fought by the Northeast Field Army and 
two armies of the Northern China People¹s Liberation Army under the command 
of Lin Piao, Lo Jung-huan, Nieh Jung-chen and other comrades, began early in 
December 1948, immediately after the victorious conclusion of the Liaohsi-Shenyang 
campaign in the Northeast. Acting upon Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s instructions, the 
Northeast Field Army, immediately after it had victoriously fulfilled its task of 
liberating the whole Northeast, swept south of the Great Wall and joined the armies 
of the People¹s Liberation Army in northern China in co-ordinated actions to

293 CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS FOR PEIPING-TIENTSIN CAMPAIGN 
encircle and wipe out the Kuomintang troops in northern China. Greatly alarmed 
by the victory of the People¹s Liberation Army in the Northeast, more than 600,000 
Kuomintang troops under Fu Tso-yi, Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang¹s 
Northern China ³Bandit Suppression² Headquarters, hurriedly shortened their lines 
of defence with the intention of fleeing south by sea or west to Suiyuan Province. Our 
army, moving with lightning speed, cut apart the enemy forces and surrounded them 
separately at five strong-points ‹ Peiping, Tientsin, Changchiakou, Hsinpao-an and 
Tangku ‹ thus blocking their escape routes to the south and west. On December 
22, the enemy¹s main force at Hsinpao-an (the headquarters of his 35th Corps and 2 
divisions) was surrounded and wiped out. On the 24th, Changchiakou was taken 
and a corps headquarters and 7 divisions of the enemy¹s 11th Army, over 54,000 men 
in all, were wiped out. On January 14, 1949, our troops surrounding Tientsin launched 
a general offensive against the city after Chen Chang-chieh, commander of the 
enemy garrison, refused to surrender. The city was liberated after twenty-nine 
hours¹ fierce fighting, the enemy garrison of over 130,000 men was wiped out and 
Chen Chang-chieh was captured. As a result, more than 200,000 enemy troops garrisoning 
Peiping were tightly surrounded by our troops and their fate was sealed. 
Owing to the efforts we made to win it over, the enemy¹s Peiping garrison, commanded 
by General Fu Tso-yi, accepted peaceful reorganization. On January 31, our troops 
entered Peiping, the city was proclaimed peacefully liberated and the Peiping-Tientsin 
campaign came to a victorious close. During this campaign, with the exception 
of the enemy garrison of over 50,000 men in Tangku, which fled by sea, over 520,000 
Kuomintang troops were put out of action and reorganized by our army. In September 
1949 the Kuomintang troops in Suiyuan Province declared by telegram that they 
had revolted and come over to the people and that they would accept reorganization. 
2 This means the area southwest of Nankow. 
3 In September 1948, to prevent the enemy forces in Ihsien, Chinchow, Chinhsi 
Hsingcheng, Suichung, Shanhaikuan, Luanhsien and Changli, all points along the 
Peiping-Liaoning Railway, from shortening their lines and concentrating, the Northeast 
Field Army, then operating along that railway, adopted the method of first 
using part of its troops to encircle and cut apart the enemy units at these points 
and then wiping them out one by one.

TO SURRENDER* 
December 17, 1948
General Tu Yu-ming, General Chiu Ching-chuan, General Li Mi and 
all corps, division and regiment commanders of the two armies under 
Generals Chiu Ching-chuan and Li Mi: 
You are now at the end of your rope. Huang Wei¹s army was 
completely wiped out on the night of the 15th, Li Yen-nien¹s army has 
taken to its heels and fled south, and it is hopeless for you to think 
of joining them. Are you hoping to break through? How can you 
break through when the People¹s Liberation Army is all around? 
During the last few days you have tried to break through, but what 
came of it? Your planes and tanks, too, are useless. We have more 
planes and tanks than you, that is, artillery and explosives which 
people call our home-made planes and tanks. Aren¹t they ten times 
more formidable than your foreign-made planes and tanks? Your 
army under Sun Yuan-liang is finished, and more than half the men 
in your two remaining armies have been wounded or captured. You 
have brought many miscellaneous and idle personnel of various organizations 
and many young students from Hsuchow and forced them 
into your army, but how can these people fight? For more than ten 
days, you have been surrounded ring upon ring and received blow 
upon blow, and your position has shrunk greatly. You have such a 
tiny place, only a little more than ten li square, and so many people 
are crowded together that a single shell from us can kill a lot of you. 
Your wounded soldiers and the families who have followed the army 
are complaining to high heaven. Your soldiers and many of your 
officers have no stomach for any more fighting. You, as deputy 
commander-in-chief, as commanders of armies, corps, divisions and 
regiments, should understand and sympathize with the feelings of your 
subordinates and families, hold their lives dear, find a way out for 
them as early as possible and stop sending them to a senseless death. 
295

296 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Now that Huang Wei¹s army has been completely wiped out and 
Li Yen-nien¹s army has fled towards Pengpu, we are able to concentrate 
an attacking force several times your strength. This time 
we have fought for only forty days, and you have already lost 10 
divisions under Huang Po-tao, II under Huang Wei, 4 under Sun Yuanliang, 
4 under Feng Chih-an, 2 under Sun Liang-cheng, 1 under Liu 
Ju-ming, 1 division in Suhsien and another in Lingpi - altogether you 
have lost 34 whole divisions. Of these, 27 divisions were completely 
wiped out by our army; the only exceptions were the 3 
divisions led by Ho Chi-feng and Chang Ke-hsia and 1 division led 
by Liao Yun-chou, which revolted and came over to our side, and 1 
division led by Sun Liang-cheng and the 2 half-divisions led by Chao 
Pi-kuang and Huang Tse-hua, which surrendered.1 You have seen 
with your own eyes the fate of the 3 armies under Huang Po-tao, 
Huang Wei and Sun Yuan-liang. You should learn from the example 
of General Cheng Tung-kuo in Changchun2 and from the current 
example of corps commander Sun Liang-cheng and division commanders 
Chao Pi-kuang and Huang Tse-hua and immediately order 
all your troops to lay down their arms and cease resistance. Our 
army will guarantee life and safety to you, high-ranking officers, and 
to all officers and men. This is your only way out. Think it over! 
If you feel this is right, then do it. If you still want to fight another 
round, you can have it, but you will be finished off anyway.3

3rd Pacification Zone, revolted against the Kuomintang in the Chiawang sector, northeast 
of Hsuchow, on November 8, 1948, during the first stage of the Huai-Hai 
campaign, and came over to the People¹s Liberation Army with 1 corps headquarters, 
3 divisions and 1 regiment, totalling more than 20,000 men. Liao Yun-chou, Commander 
of the 110th Division of the Kuomintang¹s 85th Corps, revolted against the 
Kuomintang at Lochi, southwest of Suhsien, Anhwei Province, on November 27, 
1948, during the second stage of the Huai-Hai campaign, and came over to the 
People¹s Liberation Army with his division headquarters and 2 full regiments, 
totalling 5,500 men. Sun Liang-cheng, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 
1st Pacification Zone and Commander of the 107th Corps, came over to the People¹s 
Liberation Army with his corps headquarters and 1 division, totalling 5,800 men, 
northwest of Suining, Kiangsu Province, on November 13, 1948, during the first 
stage of the Huai-Hai campaign. Chao Pi-kuang, Commander of the 150th Division 
of the Kuomintang¹s 44th Corps, came over to the People¹s Liberation Army with 
over 2,000 of his remaining troops in the Nienchuang sector, east of Hsuchow, 
Kiangsu Province, on November 18, 1948, during the first stage of the Huai-Hai 
campaign. Huang Tse-hua, Commander of the 23rd Division of the Kuomintang¹s

Anhwei Province, in December 1948, during the second stage of the Huai-Hai 
campaign. 
2 Changchun had been besieged by the Northeast People¹s Liberation Army 
since the winter of 1947. After the capture of Chinchow by our army, when all the 
enemy troops in the Northeast were in a shaky position, Cheng Tung-kuo, 
Kuomintang commander in Changchun and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 
Kuomintang¹s Northeast ³Bandit Suppression² Headquarters, led the army troops 
of the 1st Army and the officers and men of the New 7th Corps to surrender on 
October 19, 1948. 
3 After receiving this message, Tu Yu-ming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of 
the Kuomintang¹s Hsuchow ³Bandit Suppression² Headquarters, Chiu Ching-chuan, 
Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 2nd Army, and Li Mi, Commander of the Kuomintang¹s 
13th Army, continued to resist desperately with the result that all their 
troops were wiped out by our army¹s powerful offensive. Tu Yu-ming was captured, 
Chiu Ching-chuan was killed and only Li Mi managed to escape.


CARRY THE REVOLUTION THROUGH 
TO THE END* 
December 30, 1948
The Chinese people will win final victory in the great War of 
Liberation. Even our enemy no longer doubts the outcome. 
The war has followed a tortuous course. When the reactionary 
Kuomintang government started the counter-revolutionary war, it 
had approximately three and a half times as many troops as the 
People¹s Liberation Army; the equipment, manpower and material 
resources of its army were far superior to those of the People¹s Liberation 
Army; it had modern industries and modern means of 
communication, which the People¹s Liberation Army lacked; it had 
received large-scale military and economic aid from U.S. imperialism 
and had made long preparations. Therefore, during the first year 
of the war July 1946-June 1947) the Kuomintang was on the offensive 
and the People¹s Liberation Army on the defensive. In 1946 
in the Northeast, the Kuomintang occupied Shenyang, Szepingkai, 
Changchun, Kirin, Antung and other cities and most of Liaoning, 
Liaopei and Antung Provinces;1 south of the Yellow River, it occupied 
the cities of Huaiyin and Hotse and most of the Hupeh-Honan- 
Anhwei, Kiangsu-Anhwei, Honan-Anhwei-Kiangsu and Southwestern 
Shantung Liberated Areas; and north of the Great Wall, it occupied 
the cities of Chengteh, Chining and Changchiakou and most of Jehol, 
Suiyuan and Chahar Provinces. The Kuomintang blustered and 
swaggered like a conquering hero. The People¹s Liberation Army 
adopted the correct strategy, which had as its main objective to wipe 
out the Kuomintang¹s effective strength rather than to hold territory, 
and in each month destroyed an average of some eight brigades of 
the Kuomintang regular troops (the equivalent of eight present-day 
divisions). As a result, the Kuomintang was finally compelled to 
abandon its plan for the over-all offensive and by the first half of 1947 
299

300 MAO TSE-TUNG 
it had to limit the major targets of its attack to the two wings of the 
southern front, i.e., Shantung and northern Shensi. In the second 
year (July 1947-June 1948) a fundamental change took place in the 
war. Having wiped out large numbers of Kuomintang regulars, the 
People¹s Liberation Army went over from the defensive to the offensive 
on the southern and northern fronts, while the Kuomintang had 
to turn from the offensive to the defensive. The People¹s Liberation 
Army not only recovered most of the territories lost in northeastern 
China, Shantung and northern Shensi but also extended the battle front 
into the Kuomintang areas north of the Yangtse and Weishui Rivers. 
Moreover, in the course of attacking and capturing Shihchiachuang, 
Yuncheng, Szepingkai, Loyang, Yichuan, Paoki, Weihsien, Linfen and 
Kaifeng, our army mastered the tactics of storming heavily fortified 
points.2 The People¹s Liberation Army formed its own artillery and 
engineer corps. Don¹t forget that the People¹s Liberation Army had 
neither aircraft nor tanks, but once it had formed an artillery and an 
engineer corps superior to those of the Kuomintang army, the defensive 
system of the Kuomintang, with all its aircraft and tanks, appeared 
negligible by contrast. The People¹s Liberation Army was already 
able to conduct not only mobile warfare but positional warfare as 
well. In the first half of the third year of the war (July-December 
1948), another fundamental change has occurred. The People¹s Liberation 
Army, so long outnumbered, has gained numerical superiority. 
It has been able not only to capture the Kuomintang¹s heavily fortified 
cities but also to surround and destroy strong formations of 
Kuomintang crack troops, a hundred thousand or several hundred 
thousand at a time. The rate at which the People¹s Liberation Army 
is wiping out Kuomintang troops has become much faster. Look at 
the statistics on the number of Kuomintang regular units of battalion 
level and above which we have destroyed (including enemy troops 
who have revolted and come over to our side). In the first year, 97 
brigades, including 46 brigades entirely wiped out; in the second year, 
94 brigades, including 50 brigades entirely wiped out; and in the first 
half of the third year, according to incomplete figures, 147 divisions, 
including 111 divisions entirely wiped out.3 In these six months, the 
number of enemy divisions entirely wiped out was 15 more than the 
grand total for the previous two years. The enemy front as a whole 
* This New Year message for 1949 was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the 
Hsinhua News Agency.

301 CARRY THE REVOLUTION THROUGH TO THE END 
has completely crumbled. The enemy troops in the Northeast have 
been entirely wiped out; those in northern China will soon be entirely 
wiped out, and in eastern China and the Central Plains only a few 
enemy forces are left. The annihilation of the Kuomintang¹s main 
forces north of the Yangtse River greatly facilitates the forthcoming 
crossing of the Yangtse by the People¹s Liberation Army and its southward 
drive to liberate all China. Simultaneously with victory on the 
military front, the Chinese people have scored tremendous victories 
on the political and economic fronts. For this reason public opinion 
the world over, including the entire imperialist press, no longer disputes 
the certainty of the country-wide victory of the Chinese People¹s 
War of Liberation. 
The enemy will not perish of himself. Neither the Chinese reactionaries 
nor the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism in China will 
step down from the stage of history of their own accord. Precisely 
because they realize that the country-wide victory of the Chinese People¹s 
War of Liberation can no longer be prevented by purely military 
struggle, they are placing more and more importance each day on 
political struggle. On the one hand, the Chinese reactionaries and 
the U.S. aggressors are using the existing Kuomintang government for 
their ³peace² plot; on the other hand, they are scheming to use certain 
persons who have connections both with them and with the revolutionary 
camp, inciting and instigating these persons to work artfully, 
strive to infiltrate the revolutionary camp and form a so-called opposition 
faction within it. The purpose is to preserve the reactionary 
forces and undermine the revolutionary forces. According to reliable 
information, the U.S. government has decided on this scheme and 
begun to carry it out in China. The U.S. government has changed 
its policy of simply backing the Kuomintang¹s counter-revolutionary 
war to a policy embracing two forms of struggle: 
1. Organizing the remnants of the Kuomintang¹s armed forces 
and the so-called local forces to continue to resist the People¹s 
Liberation Army south of the Yangtse River and in the remote 
border provinces, and 
2. Organizing an opposition faction within the revolutionary 
camp to strive with might and main to halt the revolution where 
it is or, if it must advance, to moderate it and prevent it from 
encroaching too far on the interests of the imperialists and their 
running dogs.

302 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The British and French imperialists support this U.S. policy. Many 
people do not yet see this situation clearly, but it probably will not 
be long before they do. 
The question now facing the Chinese people, all democratic parties 
and all people¹s organizations is whether to carry the revolution 
through to the end or to abandon it half-way. If the revolution is to 
be carried through to the end, we must use the revolutionary method to 
wipe out all the forces of reaction resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and 
completely; we must unswervingly persist in overthrowing imperialism, 
feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism; and we must overthrow the 
reactionary rule of the Kuomintang on a country-wide scale and set 
up a republic that is a people¹s democratic dictatorship under the 
leadership of the proletariat and with the worker-peasant alliance as 
its main body. In this way, the Chinese nation will completely throw 
off the oppressor; the country will be transformed from a semi-colony 
into a genuinely independent state; the Chinese people will be fully 
emancipated, overthrowing once and for all both feudal oppression 
and oppression by bureaucrat-capital (Chinese monopoly capital) and 
will thus achieve unity, democracy and peace, create the prerequisites 
for transforming China from an agricultural into an industrial country 
and make it possible for her to develop from a society with exploitation 
of man by man into a socialist society. If the revolution is abandoned 
half-way, it will mean going against the will of the people, bowing 
to the will of the foreign aggressors and Chinese reactionaries and 
giving the Kuomintang a chance to heal its wounds, so that one day 
it may pounce suddenly to strangle the revolution and again plunge 
the whole country into darkness. That is how clearly and sharply 
the question is now posed. Which of these two roads to choose? 
Every democratic party, every people¹s organization in China must 
consider this question, must choose its road and clarify its stand. 
Whether China¹s democratic parties and people¹s organizations can 
sincerely co-operate without parting company half-way depends on 
whether they are agreed on this question and take unanimous action to 
overthrow the common enemy of the Chinese people. What is needed 
here is unanimity and co-operation, not the setting up of any ³opposition 
faction² or the pursuit of any ³middle road².4 
In the long period of more than twenty years from the counterrevolutionary 
coup d¹état of April 12, 19275 to this day, have the 
Chinese reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk not given 
proof enough that they are a gang of blood-stained executioners, who

303 CARRY THE REVOLUTION THROUGH TO THE END 
slaughter people without blinking? Have they not given proof enough 
that they are a band of professional traitors and the running dogs 
of imperialism? Think it over, everybody! How magnanimous the 
Chinese people have been towards this gang of bandits in the hope 
of achieving internal peace with them, since the Sian Incident of 
December 1936, since the Chungking negotiations of October 1945 and 
since the Political Consultative Conference of January 1946! But has 
all this goodwill changed their class nature by one jot or title? In 
their history not a single one of these bandits can be separated from 
U.S. imperialism. Relying on U.S. imperialism, they have plunged 475 
million of our compatriots into a huge civil war of unprecedented 
brutality and slaughtered millions upon millions of men and women, 
young and old, with bombers, fighter planes, guns, tanks, rocketlaunchers, 
automatic rifles, gasoline bombs, gas projectiles and other 
weapons, all supplied by U.S. imperialism. And relying on these 
criminals, U.S. imperialism on its part has seized China¹s sovereign 
rights over her own territory, waters and air space, seized inland 
navigation rights and special commercial privileges, seized special 
privileges in China¹s domestic and foreign affairs and even seized the 
privilege of killing people, beating them up, driving cars over them 
and raping women, all with impunity. Can it be said that the Chinese 
people, who have been compelled to fight such a long and bloody war, 
should still show affection and tenderness towards these most vicious 
enemies and should not completely destroy or expel them? Only by 
completely destroying the Chinese reactionaries and expelling the 
aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism can China gain independence, 
democracy and peace. Isn¹t this truth clear enough by now? 
What deserves attention is that all of a sudden the enemies of the 
Chinese people are doing their best to assume a harmless and even 
a pitiable look (readers, please remember that in the future they will 
try to look pitiable again). Didn¹t Sun Fo, who has now become 
president of the Kuomintang¹s Executive Yuan, state in June last year 
that a ³settlement will finally come, provided militarily we fight to the 
end²? But this time, the moment he took office he talked glibly about 
an ³honourable peace² and said that ³the Government has been 
striving for peace and only resorted to fighting because peace could 
not be realized, but the ultimate objective of fighting is still to restore 
peace². Immediately afterwards, on December 21, a United Press 
dispatch from Shanghai predicted that Sun Fo¹s statement would meet 
with widespread approval in U.S. official quarters and among the

304 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Kuomintang liberals. At present, U.S. officials have not only become 
deeply interested in ³peace² in China but also repeatedly assert that 
ever since the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet 
Union, the United States and Britain in December 1945, the United 
States has adhered to a ³policy of non-interference in China¹s internal 
affairs². How are we to deal with these worthies from the ³Land of 
Gentlemen²? Here, it is fitting to quote an ancient Greek fable. 
One winter¹s day, a farmhand found a snake frozen by the cold. 
Moved by compassion, he picked it up and put it in his bosom. The 
snake was revived by the warmth, its natural instincts returned, and 
it gave its benefactor a fatal bite. The dying farmhand said, ³I¹ve 
got what I deserve for taking pity on an evil creature.²6 Venomous 
snakes, foreign and Chinese, hope that the Chinese people will die 
like the farmhand, that like him the Chinese Communist Party and all 
Chinese revolutionary democrats will be kind-hearted to them. But 
the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party and the genuine 
revolutionary democrats of China have heard the labourer¹s dying 
words and will well remember them. Moreover, the serpents infesting 
most of China, big or small, black or white, baring their poisonous 
fangs or assuming the guise of beautiful girls, are not yet frozen by 
the cold, although they already sense the threat of winter. 
The Chinese people will never take pity on snake-like scoundrels, 
and they honestly believe that no one is their true friend who guilefully 
says that pity should be shown these scoundrels and says that 
anything else would be out of keeping with China¹s traditions, fall 
short of greatness, etc. Why should one take pity on snake-like 
scoundrels? What worker, what peasant, what soldier, says that such 
scoundrels should be pitied? True, there are ³Kuomintang liberals² 
or non-Kuomintang ³liberals² who advise the Chinese people to accept 
the ³peace² offered by the United States and the Kuomintang, 
that is, to enshrine and worship the remnants of imperialism, feudalism 
and bureaucrat-capitalism so that these treasures shall not become 
extinct on earth. But they are decidedly not workers, peasants or 
soldiers, nor are they the friends of workers, peasants and soldiers. 
We hold that the Chinese people¹s revolutionary camp must be 
expanded and must embrace all who are willing to join the revolutionary 
cause at the present stage. The Chinese people¹s revolution needs 
a main force and also needs allies, for an army without allies cannot 
defeat the enemy. The Chinese people, now at the high tide of 
revolution, need friends and they should remember their friends and

305 CARRY THE REVOLUTION THROUGH TO THE END 
not forget them. In China there are undoubtedly many friends faithful 
to the people¹s revolutionary cause, who try to protect the people¹s 
interests and are opposed to protecting the enemy¹s interests, 
and undoubtedly none of these friends should be forgotten or coldshouldered. 
Also, we hold that we must consolidate the Chinese 
people¹s revolutionary camp and not allow bad elements to sneak in 
or wrong views to prevail. Besides keeping their friends in mind, 
the Chinese people, now at the high tide of revolution, should also 
keep their enemies and the friends of their enemies firmly in mind. 
As we said above, since the enemy is cunningly using the method of 
³peace² and the method of sneaking into the revolutionary camp to 
preserve and strengthen his position, whereas the fundamental interests 
of the people demand that all reactionary forces be destroyed 
thoroughly and that the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism be driven 
out of China, those who advise the people to take pity on the enemy 
and preserve the forces of reaction are not friends of the people, but 
friends of the enemy. 
The raging tide of China¹s revolution is forcing all social strata 
to decide their attitude. A new change is taking place in the balance 
of class forces in China. Multitudes of people are breaking away 
from Kuomintang influence and control and coming over to the revolutionary 
camp; and the Chinese reactionaries have fallen into hopeless 
straits, isolated and abandoned. As the People¹s War of Liberation 
draws closer and closer to final victory, all the revolutionary people 
and all friends of the people will unite more solidly and, led by the 
Communist Party of China, resolutely demand the complete destruction 
of the reactionary forces and the thoroughgoing development of the 
revolutionary forces until a people¹s democratic republic on a countrywide 
scale is founded and a peace based on unity and democracy is 
achieved. The U.S. imperialists, the Chinese reactionaries and their 
friends, on the contrary, are incapable of uniting solidly and will 
indulge in endless squabbles, mutual abuse, recrimination and betrayal. 
On one point, however, they will co-operate ‹ in striving by every 
means to undermine the revolutionary forces and preserve the reactionary 
forces. They will use every means, open and secret, direct 
and indirect. But it can definitely be stated that their political 
intrigues will meet with the same defeats as their military attacks. 
Having had plenty of experience, the Chinese people and their 
general staff, the Communist Party of China, are certain to smash the 
enemy¹s political intrigues, just as they have shattered his military

306 MAO TSE-TUNG 
attacks, and to carry the great People¹s War of Liberation through to 
the end. 
In 1949, the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army will advance south 
of the Yangtse River and will win even greater victories than in 1948. 
In 1949, on the economic front we shall achieve even greater 
successes than in 1948. Our agricultural and industrial production will 
rise to a higher level than before, and rail and highway traffic will be 
completely restored. In their operations the main formations of the 
People¹s Liberation Army will discard certain survivals of guerrilla 
habits and reach a higher level of regularization. 
In 1949, the Political Consultative Conference, with no reactionaries 
participating and having as its aim the fulfilment of the tasks of the 
people¹s revolution, will be convened, the People¹s Republic of China 
will be proclaimed, and the Central Government of the Republic will be 
established. This government will be a democratic coalition government 
under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with 
the participation of appropriate persons representing the democratic 
parties and people¹s organizations. 
These are the main concrete tasks which the Chinese people, the 
Communist Party of China and all the democratic parties and people¹s 
organizations in China should strive to fulfil in 1949. We shall brave 
all difficulties and unite as one to fulfil these tasks. 
In our struggle we shall overthrow once and for all the feudal 
oppression of thousands of years and the imperialist oppression of a 
hundred years. The year 1949 will be a year of tremendous importance. 
We should redouble our efforts. 
NOTES 
1 Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Kuomintang government divided 
the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Kirin and Heilungkiang into nine 
provinces, Liaoning, Liaopei, Antung, Kirin, Hokiang, Sungkiang, Heilungkiang, 
Nunkiang and Hsingan. In 1949 our Northeast Administrative Commission redivided 
the area into five provinces, Liaotung, Liaohsi, Kirin, Heilungkiang and Sungkiang. 
Together with Jehol, these provinces were then referred to as the six northeastern 
provinces. In 1954 the Central People¹s Government Council merged the two provinces 
of Liaotung and Liaohsi into the one province of Liaoning and the two provinces of 
Sungkiang and Heilungkiang into the one province of Heilungkiang, while Kirin 
remained unchanged. In 1955 Jehol Province was abolished and the area previously 
under its jurisdiction was divided and incorporated into the provinces of Hopei and 
Liaoning and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.

2 The dates of the taking of these key points were: Shihchiachuang, November 
12, 1947; Yuncheng, December 28, 1947; Szepingkai, March 13, 1948; Loyang first on 
March 1,1948, and again on April 5, 1948; Yichuan, March 3, 1948; Paoki, April 26, 1948; 
Weihsien, April 27, 1948; Linfen, May 17, 1948; and Kaifeng, June 22, 1948. All these 
cities were fortified with many groups of blockhouses, and some had high, thick city 
walls; also, they all had auxiliary defence works, including multiple lines of trenches 
barbed-wire entanglements and abatis. Our army at the time had neither planes nor 
tanks, and little or no artillery. In attacking and taking these cities, our army learned 
a complete set of tactics for taking strong fortifications. These tactics were: 
(1) successive demolition ‹ using explosives to demolish the enemy¹s 
different defence installations in succession; 
(2) tunnel operations ‹ secretly digging tunnels to and under the enemy¹s 
blockhouses or city walls, then blowing them up with explosives and following 
up with fierce attacks; 
(3) approach trench operations ‹ digging trenches towards the enemy¹s 
fortifications, then approaching under cover to make sudden attacks; 
(4) explosive package projectors ‹ shooting packages of explosives from 
missile-projectors or mortars to destroy the enemy¹s defences; 
(5) ³sharp knife² tactics ‹ concentrating manpower and firepower to effect 
a breakthrough and to cut up the enemy forces. 
3 The brigades mentioned here were those designated as brigades after the 
reorganization of the Kuomintang army, while the divisions were pre-reorganization 
divisions (which were practically the same as the reorganized brigades).

ON THE WAR CRIMINAL¹S SUING FOR PEACE* 
January 5, 1949
In order to preserve the forces of Chinese reaction and U.S. 
aggression in China, Chiang Kai-shek, China¹s No. 1 war criminal and 
chieftain of the Kuomintang bandit gang, issued a statement on New 
Year¹s Day suing for peace. The war criminal Chiang Kai-shek says: 
I have no desire of my own other than that the peace negotiations 
should not impair the country¹s independence and integrity 
but instead should help the rehabilitation of the people; that the 
sacred constitution should not be violated by my action and that 
democratic constitutionalism should not be thereby undermined; 
that the form of government of the Republic of China should be 
guaranteed and the legally constituted authority of the Republic 
of China should not be interrupted; that the armed forces should 
be definitely preserved and that the people should be allowed to 
continue their free way of life and maintain their present minimum 
standard of living. 
. . . If only peace can be realized, I certainly do not care whether 
I remain in office or retire, but will abide by the common will of 
the people. 
People should not think that there is something ridiculous about a 
war criminal suing for peace, nor should they think that such a bid 
for peace is really disgusting. It should be understood that for the 
No. 1 war criminal and chieftain of the Kuomintang bandit gang to 
sue personally for peace and issue such a statement is obviously of 
some benefit to the Chinese people, because it enables them to 
see through the plots of the Kuomintang bandit gang and the U.S. 
imperialists. For the Chinese people can tell from this that the 
³peace² about which there has lately been so much clamour is exactly 
what this Chiang Kai-shek gang of murderers and their U.S. master 
urgently need. 
309

310 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Chiang Kai-shek has confessed the gang¹s whole plot. The main 
points of this plot are as follows: 
³The peace negotiations should not impair the country¹s independence 
and integrity² ‹ this is first in importance. ³Peace² is all right, 
but ³peace² is a million times wrong if it impairs the ³independence 
and integrity² of the state of the four big families and the comprador 
and landlord classes. ³Peace² is absolutely all wrong if it impairs 
such treaties as the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and 
Navigation, the Sino-U.S. Air Transport Agreement1 and the Sino- 
U.S. bilateral agreement,2 or if it impairs such prerogatives enjoyed 
by the United States in China as the stationing of ground, naval and 
air forces, the building of military bases, the exploitation of mines 
and the monopoly of trade, or if it interferes with China¹s becoming 
a U.S. colony ‹ in short, if it impairs any such measures as protect 
the ³independence and integrity² of Chiang Kai-shek¹s reactionary 
state. 
³Help the rehabilitation of the people² ‹ that is, ³peace² must 
help the rehabilitation of the Chinese reactionaries, who have been 
defeated but not yet wiped out, so that, once rehabilitated, they can 
stage a comeback and extinguish the revolution. This is exactly what 
³peace² is for. The war has been going on for two and a half years, 
³the running dog can no longer run² and the Americans are angry; 
a rest-cure, however brief, is better than none. 
³The sacred constitution should not be violated by my action and 
democratic constitutionalism should not be thereby undermined; the 
form of government of the Republic of China should be guaranteed 
and the legally constituted authority of the Republic of China should 
not be interrupted² ‹ all this means guaranteeing the ruling position 
of China¹s reactionary classes and reactionary government and guaranteeing 
that the ³legally constituted authority² of these classes and 
their government will not be ³interrupted². This ³legally constituted 
authority² certainly must not be ³interrupted², for to ³interrupt² it 
would be very dangerous ‹ it would mean the finish of the whole 
of the comprador and landlord classes, the end of the Kuomintang 
* This commentary was the first of a series written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung 
for the Hsinhua News Agency to expose the Kuomintang¹s use of peace negotiations 
in order to preserve the counter-revolutionary forces. Other commentaries in the 
series included ³Why Do the Badly Split Reactionaries Still Idly Clamour for 
ŒTotal Peace¹?², ³The Kuomintang Reactionaries Turn from an ŒAppeal for Peace¹ 
to an Appeal for War², ³On the Kuomintang¹s Different Answers to the Question of 
Responsibility for the War² and ³Whither the Nanking Government?²

311 ON WAR CRIMINAL¹S SUING FOR PEACE 
gang of bandits and the arrest and punishment of all the war criminals, 
big, medium and small. 
³The armed forces should be definitely preserved² ‹ they are the 
lifeline of the comprador and landlord classes, and although several 
millions have been wiped out by the detested People¹s Liberation Army, 
there still remain one million several hundred thousand troops which 
must be ³preserved², and ³definitely² so. If they were ³preserved², 
but not ³definitely², the comprador and landlord classes would lose 
their capital, their ³legally constituted authority² would still be ³interrupted², 
the Kuomintang bandit gang would still be finished, all the 
war criminals, big, medium and small, would still be arrested and 
punished. Just as the life of Chia Pao-yu of the Grand View Garden 
depended upon a piece of jade in his necklace,3 the life of the Kuomintang 
depends upon its army, so how can one say that its army 
should not be ³preserved², or should only be ³preserved² but not 
³definitely² so? 
³The people should be allowed to continue their free way of life 
and maintain their present minimum standard of living² ‹ this means 
the Chinese comprador and landlord classes must preserve their freedom 
to oppress and exploit the people of the whole country and their 
freedom to maintain their present standard of lordly, luxurious, loose 
and idle living, while the Chinese working people must preserve their 
freedom to be oppressed and exploited and maintain their present 
standard of living, a life of cold and hunger. That is the ultimate 
aim of the war criminals in suing for peace. What is the use of 
peace, if the war criminals and the classes to which they belong cannot 
preserve their freedom to oppress and exploit and cannot maintain 
their standard of lordly, luxurious, loose and idle living? To preserve 
all this, it is of course necessary for the workers, peasants, intellectuals, 
government employees and teachers to maintain their present 
³free way of life and minimum standard of living², a life of cold and 
hunger. Once our beloved President Chiang puts forward this condition, 
the tens of millions of workers, handicraftsmen and professionals, 
the hundreds of millions of peasants, and the millions of intellectuals, 
government employees and teachers can only clap their hands in 
unison, prostrate themselves and shout, ³Long live the President!² 
If the Communist Party still refuses peace, so that this wonderful way 
of life and standard of living cannot be maintained, then it will be guilty 
of a crime for which it deserves to die ten thousand deaths, and ³the 
Communist Party will be held responsible for all the consequences².

312 MAO TSE-TUNG 
In saying all this, however, we have not exhausted the whole 
treasury of wonderful ideas in the war criminal¹s statement of January 
1 suing for peace. Here is another gem ‹ what Chiang Kai-shek 
in his New Year message calls ³a decisive battle in the Nanking- 
Shanghai sector². Where is the strength for such a ³decisive battle²? 
Chiang Kai-shek says, ³It must be understood that today the strength 
of the government in the military, political, economic or any other 
field is several times or even tens of times greater than that of 
the Communist Party.² Oh! Ho! How can people not be scared to 
death by such immense strength? Leaving political and economic 
strength aside and taking only military strength, one sees that the 
People¹s Liberation Army now has over three million men, that two 
times ³greater² than this number is over six million and that ten times 
³greater² is over thirty million. And how many will ³tens of times² 
be? All right, let¹s take twenty times, which gives over sixty million 
men; no wonder President Chiang says he has ³full confidence in winning 
the decisive battle². Why then should he beg for peace? Certainly 
not because he can no longer fight. For if he were to bring the pressure 
of over sixty million troops to bear, could there be any chance 
of survival for the Communist Party or any other party in the world? 
All of course would be crushed to powder. It is clear then that when 
he begs for peace, it is certainly for no other reason than ³to plead 
for the life of the people². 
But is everything going well, without any hitch? There is a hitch, 
it is said. What is the hitch? President Chiang says: 
It is regrettable that there are people in our government who 
have come under the influence of malicious Communist propaganda 
and are consequently in a wavering state of mind, having almost 
lost their self-confidence. Spiritually menaced by the Communists, 
they see only the enemy¹s strength but not our own huge strength, 
which is tens of times greater than the enemy¹s. 
Well, every year brings its crop of news, but this year¹s is something 
very special. Isn¹t it an extra-special piece of news that members of 
the Kuomintang, with their sixty million odd officers and men, see 
only the People¹s Liberation Army of three million odd men but not 
their own army of over sixty million? 
One may ask, ³Is there a market for such news?² and ³Is it worth 
even a glance?² According to information received from inside the 
city of Peiping, ³On New Year¹s Day prices dropped slightly in the

313 ON WAR CRIMINAL¹S SUING FOR PEACE 
morning but recovered in the afternoon.² And a foreign news agency 
reports, ³Shanghai¹s response to Chiang Kai-shek¹s New Year message 
is cold.² This answers the question as to whether the war criminal 
Chiang Kai-shek has any market. As we said long ago, Chiang Kaishek 
has lost his soul, is merely a corpse, and no one believes him 
any more. 
NOTES 
1 The ³Sino-U.S. Air Transport Agreement² between the Chiang Kai-shek 
government and U.S. imperialism was signed on December 20, 1946. In this agreement, 
Chiang Kai-shek completely sold out China¹s sovereignty over her air space. 
According to its provisions, U.S. aircraft were allowed to fly, load and unload or 
trans-ship anywhere within China, and the United States gained complete control of the 
country¹s air transport. U.S. aircraft were also accorded the right of ³non-traffic stop² 
that is, of military landings on Chinese territory. 
2 The ³Sino-U.S. bilateral agreement² was the so-called Sino-U.S. Economic 
Aid Agreement signed at Nanking on July 3, 1948 between the representatives of the 
Chiang Kai-shek government and U.S. imperialism. It stipulated that U.S. imperialism 
was to have supreme authority to supervise and decide the financial and economic 
affairs of the Chiang Kai-shek government, that U.S. personnel exercising direct 
control in China were to enjoy ³extraterritorial rights², and that U.S. imperialism could 
obtain from China any strategic materials it needed and was to be kept informed 
regularly by the Chiang Kai-shek government about their availability. In this agreement 
the Chiang Kai-shek government also guaranteed that U.S. goods could be 
dumped in China.

century Chinese novel, and the Grand View Garden was his family garden. It was 
said that Chia Pao-yu was born with a piece of jade in his mouth. This jade was 
³the root of his life² and had to be worn constantly around his neck. He was not to 
part with it. If he lost it, he would lose his wits.


STATEMENT ON THE PRESENT SITUATION 
BY MAO TSE-TUNG, CHAIRMAN OF 
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA 
January 14, 1949
Two and a half years have gone by since July 1946, when the 
reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government, with the aid of the 
U.S. imperialists, violated the will of the people, tore up the truce 
agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference 
and launched the country-wide counter-revolutionary civil war. In 
these two and a half years of war, the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang 
government has, in violation of the will of the people, convened a bogus 
National Assembly, promulgated a bogus constitution, elected a bogus 
president and issued a bogus decree on the so-called ³mobilization for 
putting down the rebellion²; sold out the national interest wholesale 
to the U.S. government and received loans amounting to thousands of 
millions of U.S. dollars; invited the U.S. navy and air force to occupy 
China¹s territory and territorial sea and air; signed a large batch of 
treasonable treaties with the U.S. government and accepted the U.S. 
Military Advisory Group¹s participation in China¹s civil war; and 
obtained from the U.S. government huge quantities of aircraft, tanks, 
light and heavy artillery, machine-guns, rifles, shells, bullets and other 
war materiel for slaughtering the Chinese people. And it was on 
the basis of these reactionary and traitorous basic policies, domestic 
and foreign, that the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government 
ordered millions of troops to launch ruthless attacks on the Chinese 
People¹s Liberated Areas and the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army. 
All the People¹s Liberated Areas in eastern China, the Central Plains, 
northern China, the Northwest and the Northeast were, without exception, 
trampled upon by the Kuomintang troops. The leading cities 
in the Liberated Areas, such as Yenan, Changchiakou, Huaiyin, 
315

316 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Hotse, Taming, Linyi, Yentai, Chengteh, Szepingkai, Changchun, 
Kirin and Antung, were all occupied by these bandit troops at one 
time or another. Wherever they went, they massacred and raped, 
burned and looted, and stopped at nothing. In the areas under its 
rule, the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government sucks the 
life-blood of the broad masses of the people ‹ the workers, peasants, 
soldiers, intellectuals and businessmen ‹ by exacting grain levies, taxes 
and forced labour for ³putting down the rebellion and suppressing 
the bandits². The reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government 
deprives the people of all their freedoms and rights; it oppresses all 
the democratic parties and the people¹s organizations, denying them 
their legal status; it suppresses the righteous movement of the students 
against civil war, hunger and persecution and against U.S. interference 
in China¹s internal affairs and U.S. fostering of the forces of aggression 
in Japan; it floods the country with the bogus national currency and 
the bogus gold yuan notes, thus ruining the economic life of the people 
and reducing the broad masses to bankruptcy; and by various means 
of expropriation it concentrates the greatest part of the nation¹s wealth 
in the hands of the bureaucrat-capitalists headed by the four big 
families of Chiang, Soong, Kung and Chen. In short, the reactionary 
Nanking Kuomintang government has plunged the whole nation 
into dire suffering by waging a civil war based on its reactionary 
and traitorous basic policies, domestic and foreign; it absolutely cannot 
escape full responsibility. In contrast to the Kuomintang, the 
Communist Party of China did all it could after Japan¹s surrender 
to press the Kuomintang government to prevent and stop the civil 
war and realize domestic peace. Basing itself on this policy, the 
Communist Party of China struggled steadfastly and, with the support 
of the people of the whole country, first secured the signing of 
the Summary of Conversations between the Kuomintang and the 
Communist Party in October 1945. In January 1946 the Party again 
signed a truce agreement with the Kuomintang and, in co-operation 
with the democratic parties, forced the Kuomintang to accept the joint 
resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. From then on 
the Communist Party of China, together with the democratic parties 
and people¹s organizations, strove to uphold the agreement and the 
resolutions. But it is regrettable that the reactionary Kuomintang 
government showed no respect for any of the actions we took in defence 
of internal peace and the democratic rights of the people. On the 
contrary, they were taken as signs of weakness and as beneath notice.

317 STATEMENT ON THE PRESENT SITUATION 
The reactionary Kuomintang government thought that the people could 
be bullied, that the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political 
Consultative Conference could be torn up at will, that the People¹s 
Liberation Army could not withstand even a single blow while its 
own troops several million strong could overrun the country, and that 
aid from the U.S. government was inexhaustible. Therefore, the 
reactionary Kuomintang government had the audacity to violate the 
will of the people of the whole country and unleash the counterrevolutionary 
war. In these circumstances, the Communist Party of 
China had no choice but to rise resolutely against the Kuomintang 
government¹s reactionary policies and fight to safeguard the country¹s 
independence and the people¹s democratic rights. Since July 1946, the 
Communist Party of China has led the heroic People¹s Liberation Army 
to repulse the attacks of 4,300,000 troops of the reactionary Kuomintang 
government and then to go over to the counter-offensive, 
recover all the lost territories of the Liberated Areas and liberate 
many large cities, such as Shihchiachuang, Loyang, Tsinan, Chengchow, 
Kaifeng, Shenyang, Hsuchow and Tangshan. The People¹s Liberation 
Army has overcome unparalleled difficulties, grown in strength and 
equipped itself with huge quantities of arms given to the Kuomintang 
government by the U.S. government. In two and a half years, it has 
wiped out the main military forces of the reactionary Kuomintang 
government and all its crack divisions. Today the People¹s Liberation 
Army is superior to the remnant military forces of the reactionary 
Kuomintang government in numbers, morale and equipment. It is 
only now that the Chinese people can begin to breathe freely. The 
present situation is quite clear ‹ the whole structure of the reactionary 
Kuomintang regime will crumble and perish if the People¹s Liberation 
Army launches a few more powerful attacks against its remnant 
forces. Having pursued a policy of civil war, the reactionary Kuomintang 
government is now reaping what it has sown, the masses are 
in rebellion, its close followers are deserting, and it can no longer 
maintain itself. In these circumstances, in order to preserve the 
remnant forces of the Kuomintang government and in order to gain 
a breathing space before making new onslaughts to destroy the revolutionary 
forces, Chiang Kai-shek, China¹s No. 1 war criminal, chieftain 
of the Kuomintang bandit gang and bogus president of the Nanking 
government, advanced the proposal on January 1 of this year that he 
was willing to hold peace negotiations with the Communist Party 
of China. The Communist Party of China considers this proposal

318 MAO TSE-TUNG 
hypocritical. The reason is that Chiang Kai-shek has proposed as 
the basis for the peace negotiations such terms as preserving the 
bogus constitution, preserving the bogus ³constituted authority² and 
preserving the armed forces of reaction, terms which the people 
throughout the country cannot accept. These are terms for continuing 
the war, not for peace. In the last ten days the people throughout 
the country have made their will clear. They eagerly hope for an 
early peace, but they do not approve the so-called peace of the war 
criminals, do not approve their reactionary terms. Basing itself on 
the will of the people, the Communist Party of China declares that 
although the People¹s Liberation Army has ample strength and abundant 
reason to wipe out completely the remnant armed forces of the 
reactionary Kuomintang government in not too long a period and 
has full confidence that it can do so, nevertheless, in order to hasten 
the end of the war, bring about genuine peace and alleviate the people¹s 
sufferings, the Communist Party of China is willing to hold peace 
negotiations with the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government 
or with any local governments or military groups of the Kuomintang 
on the basis of the following terms: 
(1) Punish the war criminals; 
(2) Abolish the bogus constitution; 
(3) Abolish the bogus ³constituted authority²; 
(4) Reorganize all reactionary troops on democratic principles; 
(5) Confiscate bureaucrat-capital; 
(6) Reform the land system; 
(7) Abrogate treasonable treaties; 
(8) Convene a political consultative conference without the participation 
of reactionary elements, and form a democratic 
coalition government to take over all the powers of the 
reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government and of its 
subordinate governments at all levels.1 
The Communist Party of China holds that the above terms express the 
common will of the people throughout the country and that only a 
peace based on these terms can be called a genuine democratic peace. 
If the persons in the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government 
wish to achieve a genuine democratic peace, and not a false reactionary 
peace, they should give up their reactionary terms and accept the eight 
terms put forth by the Communist Party of China as the basis for 
peace negotiations. Otherwise their so-called peace will prove to

319 STATEMENT ON THE PRESENT SITUATION 
be nothing but a fraud. We hope that the people throughout the 
country and all democratic parties and people¹s organizations will rise 
to fight for a genuine democratic peace and against a false reactionary 
peace. The patriots in the Nanking Kuomintang governmental system 
should also support this peace proposal. Comrade commanders and 
fighters of the People¹s Liberation Army, attention! You should not 
slacken your fighting efforts in the slightest until the reactionary Nanking 
Kuomintang government has accepted a genuine democratic 
peace and carried it out. Any reactionaries who dare to resist must 
be resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely annihilated. 
NOTES 
1 The eight terms for peace put forward by Comrade Mao Tse-tung in this 
statement became the basis for the peace negotiations held in April 1949 between the 
delegation of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang government delegation 
headed by Chang Chih-chung. The Agreement on Internal Peace, drafted in the 
course of these negotiations, set forth concrete provisions for the eight peace terms.

COMMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN 
FOR THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA 
ON THE RESOLUTION OF 
THE NANKING EXECUTIVE YUAN 
January 21, 1949
The Central News Agency, the official news agency of the reactionary 
Nanking Kuomintang government, said in a dispatch of January 
19 that the Executive Yuan, at a meeting at 9 a.m. on the same 
day, had extensively discussed the current situation and passed the 
following resolution: 
In deference to the desire of the people of the whole country 
to realize an early peace, the Government hereby expresses its 
considered wish, first, together with the Communist Party of 
China, to effect an immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities, 
and then, to appoint delegates to enter into peace negotiations. 
The spokesman for the Communist Party of China states: This resolution 
of the Nanking Executive Yuan makes no mention of the 
statement proposing peace negotiations issued on January 1 by Chiang 
Kai-shek, the bogus Nanking president, or of the statement proposing 
peace negotiations issued on January 14 by Chairman Mao Tse-tung 
of the Communist Party of China; nor does it indicate which of the 
two statements it supports and which it opposes, but instead puts 
forward a proposal of its own, as if neither the Kuomintang nor the 
Communist Party had made any proposals on January 1 and January 
14; all this is utterly incomprehensible. As a matter of fact, the 
Nanking Executive Yuan has not only completely ignored the Chinese 
Communist Party¹s proposal of January 14 but has also flatly 
repudiated the proposal made on January 1 by the bogus President 
Chiang Kai-shek. He said in his January 1 proposal: 
321

322 MAO TSE-TUNG 
As soon as the Communist Party has a sincere desire for peace 
and can give definite indications of this, the Government will 
certainly meet it in all sincerity and be willing to discuss concrete 
measures for ending hostilities and restoring peace. 
Now, nineteen days later, an organ of this selfsame government, that 
is, the ³Executive Yuan² of the Nanking government, repudiates the 
statement made by the ³president² of that government and, instead of 
saying that the government ³will certainly meet² the Communist Party 
³in all sincerity and be willing to discuss concrete measures for ending 
hostilities and restoring peace², it says, ³first, effect an immediate and 
unconditional cessation of hostilities, and then, appoint delegates to 
enter into peace negotiations.² We should like to ask the gentlemen 
of the ³Executive Yuan² at Nanking: after all, which proposal stands, 
yours or that of your ³president²? Your ³president² regarded ³ending 
hostilities and restoring peace² as one and the same thing and professed 
sincerity and willingness to discuss concrete measures for doing so with 
the Communist Party of China, whereas you divorce war from peace as 
two separate things and are reluctant to appoint delegates to discuss 
with us concrete measures for ending hostilities and, instead, indulge 
in the wildest fantasy, proposing ³first, to effect an immediate and 
unconditional cessation of hostilities² and then to appoint delegates 
to ³enter into peace negotiations². Which proposal is right, yours or 
that of your ³president²? We hold that the bogus Executive Yuan 
at Nanking has acted beyond its authority; it has no right to cast aside 
the proposal of its bogus president and arbitrarily make a new proposal 
of its own. We regard this new proposal as unreasonable; having 
fought such a large-scale, protracted and cruel war, both sides should 
as a matter of course appoint delegates to discuss basic peace terms 
and work out a mutually acceptable truce agreement; only thus can 
the war be stopped. Not only do the people desire this, even on the 
Kuomintang side many persons have expressed this desire. If the 
absolutely groundless ³resolution² of the Nanking Executive Yuan is 
followed and the Kuomintang is unwilling to carry on peace negotiations 
unless there is first a cessation of hostilities, then where is its 
sincere desire for peace? The ³resolution² of the Nanking Executive 
Yuan has been adopted, there can be no peace negotiations unless 
there is first a cessation of hostilities, and from now on the door to peace 
is shut tight; if there are to be negotiations, the only thing to do is to 
annul this absolutely groundless ³resolution². It must be one or the

323 ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE NANKING EXECUTIVE YUAN 
other. If the Nanking Executive Yuan is unwilling to annul its own 
³resolution², this will only show that the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang 
government has no sincere desire to hold peace negotiations 
with the opposing side. People will ask, if Nanking is sincere, why 
is it unwilling to discuss concrete peace terms? Hasn¹t the conclusion 
been confirmed that Nanking¹s peace proposal is hypocritical? 
The spokesman for the Communist Party says: Nanking has now 
fallen into a state of anarchy, the bogus president has one proposal 
and the bogus Executive Yuan has another. With whom is one 
to deal?


ON ORDERING THE REACTIONARY 
KUOMINTANG GOVERNMENT 
TO RE-ARREST YASUJI OKAMURA, 
FORMER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF 
THE JAPANESE FORCES OF AGGRESSION 
IN CHINA, AND TO ARREST 
THE KUOMINTANG CIVIL WAR CRIMINALS 
‹ STATEMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN FOR 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA 
January 28, 1949
The Central News Agency of the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang 
government reported in a dispatch dated January 26: 
A Government spokesman made the following statement. In 
the past month the Government has taken various measures and 
steps for an early conclusion of the war in order to alleviate 
the sufferings of the people. Furthermore, on the 22nd of this 
month, the Government formally appointed a delegation1 to the 
peace negotiations. During the last few days, the Government has 
only been waiting for the Communist Party of China to appoint 
its delegation and agree on a meeting place so that the negotiations 
may proceed. But in the statement broadcast from northern 
Shensi by the Hsinhua News Agency on the 25th,2 a spokesman 
for the Communist Party of China, while indicating willingness 
to negotiate a peaceful settlement with the Government, resorted 
to unbridled insults and vilification and used absurd and offensive 
language. He also said that the place for the negotiations could 
not be fixed until Peiping was completely liberated. We should 
like to ask, if the Communist Party of China, on the pretext of 
325

326 MAO TSE-TUNG 
awaiting the so-called complete liberation of Peiping, does not immediately 
appoint its delegation and agree on a meeting place and 
furthermore does not stop military operations, is it not stalling 
for time and prolonging the disaster of war? One should know 
that the hope of the people of the whole country to put an end to 
the disaster of war brooks no delay. To demonstrate its profound 
sincerity, the Government once again expresses the wish that the 
Communist Party of China will clearly realize that the salvation 
of the people should be the primary consideration today and that 
it will therefore appoint a delegation to the negotiations as soon as 
possible, so that peace can be realized at an early date. 
In another dispatch dated January 26, Nanking¹s Central News Agency 
reported from Shanghai: 
Following a review of his case on the 26th by the National 
Defence Ministry¹s Military Court for the Trial of War Criminals, 
the Japanese war criminal General Yasuji Okamura, former 
Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in 
China, was declared not guilty at 4 o¹clock this afternoon by Shih 
Mei-yu, the president of the court. The atmosphere in the courtroom 
was tense. Okamura, standing at attention, smiled a little 
on hearing the verdict. 
In view of the above, the spokesman for the Communist Party of 
China makes the following statement: 
1. The Communist Party of China and the General Headquarters 
of the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army declare that it is impermissible 
for the Military Court for the Trial of War Criminals set 
up by the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government to return a 
verdict of ³not guilty² on the Japanese war criminal General Yasuji 
Okamura, former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary 
Forces in China and the arch-criminal among all war criminals in 
the Japanese Expeditionary Forces of aggression against China.3 The 
Chinese people, after untold human and material sacrifices during the 
eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, finally won victory 
and captured this war criminal, and they will never allow the 
reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government arbitrarily to declare 
him not guilty. The people of the whole country, all the democratic 
parties and people¹s organizations and also the patriots in the reactionary 
Nanking Kuomintang governmental system must rise at once

327 ON ARRESTING OKAMURA AND KMT CIVIL WAR CRIMINALS 
to oppose the criminal act of that government in betraying the national 
interests and collaborating with the Japanese fascist militarists. We 
hereby give a serious warning to the gentlemen of the reactionary 
Nanking government. You must re-arrest Yasuji Okamura immediately 
and return him to prison without fail. This matter is closely 
related to your request for negotiations with us. We hold that all 
your present actions are an attempt to use fake peace negotiations 
to cover up your new preparations for war, which include your conspiracy 
to induce Japanese reactionaries to come to China and join 
you in massacring the Chinese people; it is exactly for this purpose 
that you have set Yasuji Okamura free. Therefore, we absolutely will 
not permit you to do it. We have the right to order you to re-arrest 
Yasuji Okamura and be responsible for turning him over to the People¹s 
Liberation Army at a time and place to be specified by us. As 
to the other Japanese war criminals, they are to be in your temporary 
custody, pending further instructions, and you must not take it upon 
yourselves to release any of them or let any escape; those of you 
who disobey will be severely punished. 
2. We have learned from the January 26 statement of the spokesman 
for the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government that you 
gentlemen of Nanking are all so very tense, eager, solicitous and anxious 
about peace negotiations, all, it is said, for the sake of ³shortening 
the duration of the war², ³alleviating the sufferings of the people² 
and ³treating the salvation of the people as the primary consideration²; 
we have also learned that you feel that the Communist Party 
of China is so very untense, uneager, unsolicitous and unanxious in 
its response to your wish and ³furthermore does not stop military 
operations² and is in reality ³stalling for time and prolonging the 
disaster of war². We tell you gentlemen of Nanking frankly: you 
are war criminals, you will be brought to trial. We have no faith 
in your mouthings about ³peace² or ³the will of the people². You 
relied on the power of the United States, violated the will of the people, 
tore up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative 
Conference and launched this most ruthless, anti-popular, 
anti-democratic, counter-revolutionary civil war. You were then so 
tense, eager, solicitous and anxious that you would not listen to advice 
from anybody. And when you convened a bogus National Assembly, 
drew up a bogus constitution, elected a bogus president and promulgated 
a bogus decree of ³mobilization for putting down the rebellion², 
you were again so tense, eager, solicitous and anxious about it all that

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 


328 
again you would not listen to advice from anybody. At that time in 
Shanghai, Nanking and other major cities, the so-called consultative 
councils, chambers of commerce, trade unions, peasant associations, 
women¹s organizations and cultural organizations, all of which are 
either run by your government or serve as your tools, kicked up such 
a fuss about ³supporting the mobilization for putting down the rebellion² 
and ³annihilating the Communist bandits² and once again were 
so tense, eager, solicitous and anxious about it all that they would 
not listen to advice from anybody. Two and a half years have now 
passed, and during this period the number of people slaughtered by 
you has run into many millions, and the villages burned down, the 
women raped and the wealth plundered by you, as well as the lives 
and property destroyed by your air force, are beyond count; you 
have committed heinous crimes, and we must settle accounts with you. 
We hear that you are quite opposed to the struggle for settling accounts. 
But this time there is good cause for the struggle to settle accounts, 
there must be an accounting, there must be a settlement, there must 
be a fight, there must be a struggle. You are defeated. You have 
enraged the people. And the people have all risen against you in a 
life-and-death struggle. The people do not like you, the people condemn 
you, the people have risen, and you are isolated; that is why 
you have been defeated. You proposed five terms4 for peace negotiations 
and we proposed eight;5 the people at once gave their support 
to our eight terms, not to your five. You don¹t dare to rebut our eight 
terms or insist upon your five. You declare that you are willing to 
take our eight terms as the basis for the negotiations. Isn¹t that fine? 
Then why not hurry up and negotiate? So it seems that you are very 
tense, eager, solicitous and anxious and that you are very much for 
³unconditional cessation of hostilities², for ³shortening the duration 
of the war², for ³alleviating the sufferings of the people² and for 
³treating the salvation of the people as the primary consideration². 
And we? We, obviously, are not tense, not eager, not solicitous nor 
anxious and we are ³stalling for time and prolonging the disaster of 
war². But wait a moment, gentlemen of Nanking. We are going 
to be tense, eager, solicitous and anxious; the duration of the war will 
surely be shortened; and the sufferings of the people will surely be 
alleviated. Since you have already agreed to our eight terms as the 
basis for the negotiations, you and we are both going to be busy. The 
carrying out of these eight terms will keep you, us, all the democratic 
parties, people¹s organizations and people in all walks of life through

329 ON ARRESTING OKAMURA AND KMT CIVIL WAR CRIMINALS 
out the country busy for several months, half a year, a whole year, or 
several years ‹ perhaps even then we shall not have finished the job! 
Listen, gentlemen of Nanking! The eight terms are not abstract 
items, they must have concrete content; during the present short period 
it is important for everybody to do some thinking, and the people will 
forgive us a little delay. To speak frankly, the opinion of the people 
is that we should prepare well for these negotiations. There will certainly 
be negotiations, and it absolutely will not be permitted that 
anyone break them off in the middle and refuse to negotiate. Therefore 
your delegates must get ready to come. But we still need some time to 
complete our preparations and we will not allow war criminals to set 
the date of the negotiations for us. We and the people of Peiping 
are now doing an important job; we are working out a peaceful 
settlement of the Peiping question on the basis of the eight terms. 
Your men in Peiping, such as General Fu Tso-yi, are also participating 
in this work, which you admitted to be proper in the communiqué of 
your news agency.6 This will not only provide a place for the peace 
negotiations, but will set an example of peaceful settlement for Nanking, 
Shanghai, Wuhan, Sian, Taiyuan, Kueisui, Lanchow, Tihua, 
Chengtu, Kunming, Changsha, Nanchang, Hangchow, Foochow, Canton, 
Taiwan, Hainan Island, etc. This work is therefore praiseworthy, 
and you gentlemen of Nanking should not adopt a casual attitude 
towards it. We are now discussing with the democratic parties, 
people¹s organizations and the democrats without party affiliation in 
both our areas and yours the problem of drawing up a list of war 
criminals and working out the concrete details of the first of our eight 
terms. It will probably not be long before this list is officially issued. 
Gentlemen of Nanking, as you know, we have not yet had time to discuss 
such a list with the democratic parties and people¹s organizations 
and officially publish it. For this we beg your pardon. The reason for 
the delay is that your request for peace negotiations came a little late. 
Had it come earlier, our preparations might have been completed by 
now. But this does not mean you have nothing to do. Besides arresting 
the Japanese war criminal Yasuji Okamura, you must at once set 
about arresting a batch of civil war criminals and, first of all, those in 
Nanking, Shanghai, Fenghua and Taiwan who were among the fortythree 
war criminals listed in the statement by an authoritative person 
in the Communist Party of China on December 25, 1948. The most 
important among them are Chiang Kai-shek, T. V. Soong, Chen Cheng, 
Ho Ying-chin, Ku Chu-tung, Chen Li-fu, Chen Kuo-fu, Chu Chia-hua,

330 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Wang Shih-chieh, Wu Kuo-chen, Tai Chuan-hsien, Tang En-po, Chou 
Chih-jou, Wang Shu-ming and Kuei Yung-ching.7 Of particular importance 
is Chiang Kai-shek, who has now fled to Fenghua8 and will 
very likely flee abroad and seek the protection of U.S. or British 
imperialism; therefore, you must quickly arrest this criminal and not 
let him escape. You shall assume full responsibility for this matter. 
Should there be any escapes, you shall be punished for the crime of 
setting bandits free, and no leniency whatsoever shall be shown. Let 
no one say he has not been warned. We hold that only by arresting 
these war criminals will one do a serious job in shortening the duration 
of the war and alleviating the people¹s sufferings. As long as the 
war criminals are at large, the duration of the war will be lengthened 
and the sufferings of the people will be aggravated. 
3. We demand that the reactionary Nanking government reply 
to the above two points. 
4. Nanking will be notified at another time concerning the preparations 
both sides should make in connection with the remainder 
of the eight terms.

1 The delegation appointed by the reactionary Kuomintang government for the 
peace negotiations consisted of Shao Li-tse, Chang Chih-chung, Huang Shao-hung, 
Peng Chao-hsien and Chung Tien-hsin. 
2 On January 25, 1949, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party pointed 
out in his statement concerning the peace negotiations: ³We have permitted the 
reactionary Nanking government to send a delegation for peace negotiations with 
us not because we recognize that government as still qualified to represent the 
Chinese people, but because it still has some remnants of the reactionary armed 
forces. If that government feels that it has completely forfeited the people¹s confidence 
and that the remnants of its reactionary armed forces are unable to resist the powerful 
People¹s Liberation Army and if that government is willing to accept the eight terms 
for peace proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, then it is of course preferable 
and beneficial to the cause of the liberation of the people to settle the matter by 
negotiations, so as to lessen the people¹s sufferings.² As to the meeting place, the 
statement said, ³It can be decided only after the complete liberation of Peiping and 
will probably be Peiping.² As to the Nanking delegates, it stated, ³Peng Chao-hsien 
is one of the key figures of the Kuomintang CC clique, which has been most 
vehemently clamouring for war, and people consider him a war criminal; the Chinese 
Communist Party cannot receive such a delegate.² 
3 Yasuji Okamura was one of the Japanese war criminals with the longest and 
blackest record of crimes of aggression against China. From 1925 t o 1927, he was 
military adviser to Sun Chuan-fang, one of the Northern warlords. In 1928, as

331 ON ARRESTING OKAMURA AND KMT CIVIL WAR CRIMINALS 
commanding officer of a Japanese infantry regiment, he took part in the war in 
which Japan attacked and seized Tsinan and was the butcher in the Tsinan Massacre. 
In 1932 he served as deputy chief of staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces which 
attacked and occupied Shanghai. In 1933 he represented the Japanese government 
at the signing of the ³Tangku Agreement² with the traitorous Kuomintang government. 
From 1937 t o 1945, he was successively the Commander of Japan¹s 11th Corps, Northern 
China Front Army and 6th Front Army and the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese 
Expeditionary Forces in China. He enforced the extremely brutal policy of ³burn 
all, kill all, loot all² in China. He was among the chief Japanese war criminals 
on the list published at Yenan in August 1945. During the People¹s War of Liberation 
he was Chiang Kai-shek¹s secret military adviser and planned Chiang¹s attacks on 
the Liberated Areas. In January 1949 he was declared not guilty and set free by the 
reactionary Kuomintang government and returned to Japan. In 1950 he accepted 
Chiang Kai-shek¹s offer of the post of senior training officer in the so-called Research 
Institute of Revolutionary Practice. Since 1955 he has organized ex-servicemen of the 
Japanese army and navy into the ³League of Comrades in Arms² (later called the 
League of Retired Comrades in Arms) and has played a vigorous role in the reactionary 
activities to revive Japanese militarism. 
4 The ³five terms² proposed by the reactionary Kuomintang government for the 
peace negotiations were put forward in Chiang Kai-shek¹s statement on New Year¹s 
Day, 1949. They were: 1. The peace negotiations ³should not impair the country¹s 
independence and integrity². 2. The peace negotiations ³should help the rehabilitation 
of the people². 3. ³The sacred constitution should not be violated by my action and 
democratic constitutionalism should not be thereby undermined; the form of government 
of the Republic of China should be guaranteed and the legally constituted 
authority of the Republic of China should not be interrupted². 4. ³The armed forces 
should be definitely preserved². 5. ³The people should be allowed to continue their 
free way of life and maintain their present minimum standard of living². Comrade 
Mao Tse-tung promptly and sternly refuted these five terms. See ³On the War 
Criminal¹s Suing for Peace², pp. 309-13 of this volume. 
5 The ³eight terms² proposed by the Communist Party of China for the peace 
negotiations were put forward in Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s statement of January 
14, 1949, on the current situation. See ³Statement on the Present Situation by 
Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China², 
pp. 315-319 of this volume. 
6 According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch dated January 27, 1949, 
the Ministry of National Defence of the Nanking government stated: ³In northern 
China, in order to shorten the war, secure peace and thereby preserve the foundations 
of the ancient capital, Peiping, and its cultural objects and historic monuments, 
Commander-in-Chief Fu Tso-yi issued a proclamation on January 22 to the effect 
that hostilities were to cease as from 10 o¹clock that day. On orders from General 
Headquarters, the bulk of our troops in Peiping have withdrawn from the city limits 
to certain designated areas.² It further stated, ³Cessation of hostilities will be 
effected also in Suiyuan and Tatung.² 
7 T. V. Soong, a plutocrat of the Kuomintang regime, had served as minister 
of finance, president of the Executive Yuan, minister of foreign affairs and special 
emissary of the Kuomintang government in the United States. Chen Cheng, formerly 
chief of the general staff, was then the Kuomintang governor of Taiwan Province. 
Ho Ying-chin had been the Kuomintang¹s chief of the general staff and minister 
of national defence. Ku Chu-tung was then chief of the general staff of the

332 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Kuomintang army. Chen Li-fu, Chen Kuo-fu and Chu Chia-hua were all chieftains 
of the Kuomintang CC clique. Wang Shih-chieh had been Kuomintang minister 
of foreign affairs. Wu Kuo-chen was the Kuomintang mayor of Shanghai. Tai 
Chuan-hsien, also known as Tai Chi-tao, had long been a member of Chiang Kai-shek¹s 
³brain trust² and was then a member of the Standing Committee of the Kuomintang 
Central Executive Committee. Tang En-po was commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang 
garrison forces in the Nanking-Shanghai-Hangchow area. Chou Chih-jou 
was commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang¹s air force. Wang Shu-ming was deputy 
commander-in-chief and chief of staff of the air force. Kuei Yung-ching was commander-
in-chief of the Kuomintang navy.

PEACE TERMS MUST INCLUDE 
THE PUNISHMENT OF JAPANESE WAR CRIMINALS 
AND KUOMINTANG WAR CRIMINALS 
‹ STATEMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN 
FOR THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA 
February 5, 1949
The statement on the question of peace negotiations made on 
January 28 by the spokesman for the Communist Party of China was 
answered on January 31 by a spokesman of the reactionary traitorous 
Kuomintang government. In his reply, the spokesman of the reactionary 
traitorous Kuomintang government quibbled about the points 
raised by the spokesman for the Communist Party of China. Concerning 
the demand of the Communist Party of China that the 
reactionary traitorous Kuomintang government should be responsible 
for re-arresting Yasuji Okamura, the chief criminal in Japan¹s invasion 
of China, turning him over to the People¹s Liberation Army, keeping 
the other Japanese war criminals in custody and preventing their 
escape, the Kuomintang spokesman said, ³This is a judicial question. 
It has nothing whatsoever to do with peace negotiations, much less 
can it be made a precondition for peace negotiations.² Concerning 
the demand of the Communist Party of China that the reactionary 
traitorous Kuomintang government should be responsible for arresting 
Chiang Kai-shek and other war criminals, the Kuomintang spokesman 
said, ³For genuine peace, no preconditions should be imposed.² The 
statement of the spokesman for the Communist Party of China, he 
added, ³does not seem to be serious enough in its attitude² and, 
moreover, ³causes complications². On this, the spokesman for the 
Communist Party of China states: As recently as January 28, our 
attitude was indeed not serious enough insofar as we still spoke of 
the reactionary traitorous Kuomintang government as a government. 
333

334 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Does this so-called ³government² still really exist? Does it exist in 
Nanking? There is no longer any administrative organ in Nanking. 
Does it exist in Canton? There is no administrative head in Canton. 
Does it exist in Shanghai? There is neither an administrative organ 
nor an administrative head in Shanghai. Does it exist in Fenghua? In 
Fenghua there is only a bogus president, who has already announced 
his ³retirement²; there is nothing else. Therefore, speaking seriously, 
we should not have regarded it as a government; it is, at most, a 
hypothetical or token government. But let us go on supposing that 
there is such a token ³government² and that there is a spokesman who 
can speak for that ³government². Then its spokesman should realize 
that this hypothetical, token, reactionary, traitorous Kuomintang government 
has not only contributed nothing towards peace negotiations, 
but has in fact caused endless complications. Didn¹t you cause complication, 
for instance, by suddenly declaring Yasuji Okamura not 
guilty at a time when you were so anxious for negotiations? Didn¹t 
you cause further complication by sending him to Japan, along with 
260 other Japanese war criminals, after the Communist Party of China 
had demanded his re-arrest? Who rules Japan today? Can it be 
said that the Japanese people rule Japan, and not the imperialists? 
Japan is a place you love so much that you believe the Japanese war 
criminals will enjoy greater security and comfort and receive more 
appropriate treatment there than in the areas you rule. Is that a 
judicial question? And why has this judicial question arisen? Can 
it be that you have forgotten that the Japanese aggressors fought 
against us for eight whole years? Does this question have nothing 
whatsoever to do with peace negotiations? When the Communist 
Party of China put forward the eight terms for peace negotiations on 
January 14, the release of Yasuji Okamura had not yet occurred. That 
occurred on January 26, and so it should be raised; it is certainly 
relevant to the peace negotiations. On January 31 you obeyed Mac- 
Arthur¹s orders and sent 260 Japanese war criminals to Japan, together 
with Yasuji Okamura; the matter thus became even more relevant to 
the peace negotiations. Why do you sue for peace? Because you have 
been defeated in war. And why have you been defeated? Because 
you launched a civil war against the people. And when did you 
launch this civil war? After the Japanese surrender. And against 
whom did you launch this war? Against the People¹s Liberation 
Army and the People¹s Liberated Areas, which had rendered extraordinary 
service in the War of Resistance Against Japan. And by

335 PEACE TERMS MUST INCLUDE PUNISHMENT OF WAR CRIMINALS 
what means have you waged the civil war? In addition to U.S. aid 
by means of the men you have snatched and the wealth you have 
plundered from the people in the areas under your rule. No sooner 
had the Chinese people¹s great decisive fight with the Japanese 
aggressors ended, no sooner had the external war ended, than you 
launched this civil war. You were defeated and you asked for 
negotiations, but suddenly you declared the chief Japanese war 
criminal Yasuji Okamura not guilty. And no sooner had we lodged 
a protest, demanding that you put him back in prison and be ready 
to hand him over to the People¹s Liberation Army, than you hurriedly 
sent him to Japan with 260 other Japanese war criminals. Gentlemen 
of the reactionary traitorous Kuomintang government, this action of 
yours is too unreasonable and is too gross a violation of the people¹s 
will. We have now deliberately added the word ³traitorous² to your 
title, and you ought to accept it. Your government has long been 
traitorous, and it was only for the sake of brevity that we sometimes 
omitted the word; now we can omit it no longer. In addition to 
all the crimes of treason you committed in the past, you have now 
committed another, and a very serious one, which must be discussed 
at the meeting for peace negotiations. Whether or not you call 
it causing complication, the matter must be discussed; and since it 
happened after January 14 and was not included in the eight terms 
we originally presented, we therefore deem it necessary to add to the 
first term a new item, the punishment of Japanese war criminals. So 
the first term now contains two items, (a) the punishment of Japanese 
war criminals and (b) the punishment of civil war criminals. We are 
justified in adding this new item; it reflects the will of the people of 
the whole country. The people of the whole country demand that 
the Japanese war criminals be punished. Even within the Kuomintang, 
many think that the punishment of Yasuji Okamura and other 
Japanese war criminals and the punishment of Chiang Kai-shek and 
other civil war criminals are both natural and right. Whether you say 
we are sincere about peace or not, the question of these two types of 
war criminal must be negotiated, and both types must be punished. 
As to our demand that you arrest a batch of civil war criminals before 
the negotiations begin and prevent their escape, you hold that ³no 
preconditions should be imposed². Gentlemen of the reactionary 
traitorous Kuomintang government, this is not a precondition but a 
demand which follows naturally from your acceptance of the term 
concerning the punishment of war criminals as a basis for negotiations.

336 MAO TSE-TUNG 
We instructed you to arrest them for fear that they would escape. At 
this time, when we have not yet completed preparations for the negotiations, 
you are pathetically anxious to negotiate and you are restless 
because you have too much leisure; therefore we have assigned you 
a reasonable job. These war criminals have to be arrested; even if 
they flee to the remotest corners of the globe, they must be arrested. 
Since you are all infinitely compassionate and merciful saviours of 
afflicted mankind, since you desire to ³shorten the duration of the war², 
!¹alleviate the sufferings of the people² and ³treat the salvation of the 
people as the primary consideration², and since you are great-hearted 
people, you should not cherish those who are responsible for the 
slaughter of millions of our fellow-countrymen. Judging by your willingness 
to accept the punishment of war criminals as part of the basis for 
negotiations, it seems you do not cherish these creatures very much. 
But, since you state that you find it rather difficult to arrest them 
immediately ‹ all right, then, prevent them from escaping; under no 
circumstances must you let these creatures run away. Just imagine, 
gentlemen, after you have taken all the trouble to send a delegation 
to discuss with us the question of punishing these war criminals, what 
would we talk about if it should turn out that they have escaped? 
What a loss of face for the gentlemen of your delegation! How then 
would you show your great ³sincerity for peace²? How then could 
you gentlemen prove that you really wish to ³shorten the duration of 
the war², ³alleviate the sufferings of the people² and ³treat the salvation 
of the people as the primary consideration², and that you are not at 
all hypocritical? The Kuomintang spokesman also talked a great deal 
of other nonsense; such nonsense can fool nobody, and we consider 
it unnecessary to reply. Gentlemen of the hypothetical, token, reactionary, 
traitorous Kuomintang ³government² (mind you, the word 
government is in inverted commas) at Nanking or Canton or Fenghua 
or Shanghai! If you think that our attitude in this statement is again 
not serious enough, please excuse us, for it is the only attitude we can 
take towards you.

TURN THE ARMY INTO A WORKING FORCE* 
February 8, 1949
Your telegram of the 4th has been received. It is very good that 
you are speeding training and consolidation and preparing to start moving 
one month ahead of schedule.1 Please proceed along these lines and 
do not slacken. Actually, however, training and consolidation must 
continue in March; the study of policy must be stressed and preparations 
must be made to take over and administer the large cities. From now 
on, the formula followed in the past twenty years, ³first the rural areas, 
then the cities², will be reversed and changed to the formula, ³first 
the cities, then the rural areas². The army is not only a fighting force, 
it is mainly a working force. All army cadres should learn how to 
take over and administer cities. In urban work they should learn how 
to be good at dealing with the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, 
good at dealing with the bourgeoisie, good at leading the 
workers and organizing trade unions, good at mobilizing and organizing 
the youth, good at uniting with and training cadres in the new 
Liberated Areas, good at managing industry and commerce, good at 
running schools, newspapers, news agencies and broadcasting stations, 
good at handling foreign affairs, good at handling problems relating 
to the democratic parties and people¹s organizations, good at adjusting 
the relations between the cities and the rural areas and solving the 
problems of food, coal and other daily necessities and good at handling 
monetary and financial problems. In short, all urban problems, with 
which in the past our army cadres and fighters were unfamiliar, should 
from now on be shouldered by them. You are to advance and occupy 
four or five provinces, and in addition to the cities you will have to 
attend to vast rural areas. Since in the south all the rural areas will 
be newly liberated, the work will be fundamentally different from that 
in the old Liberated Areas of the north. In the first year, the policy 
of reducing rent and interest cannot be applied, and rent and interest 
337

338 MAO TSE-TUNG 
will have to be paid in roughly the same way as before. Our rural 
work will have to proceed under these conditions. Therefore, rural 
work must also be learned afresh. However, as compared with urban 
work, rural work is easy to learn. Urban work is more difficult and 
is the main subject you are studying. If our cadres cannot quickly 
master the administration of cities, we shall encounter extreme difficulties. 
Consequently you must settle all other problems in February 
and use the whole month of March to learn how to work in the cities 
and in the new Liberated Areas. The Kuomintang has only one 
million several hundred thousand troops, scattered over a huge territory. 
Of course, there are still many battles to fight, but there is 
little possibility of such large-scale fighting as in the Huai-Hai campaign, 
and it may even be said that there is no such possibility and that 
the period of severe fighting is over. The army is still a fighting force, 
and in this respect there must be absolutely no relaxing; to relax would 
be a mistake. Nevertheless, the time has come for us to set ourselves 
the task of turning the army into a working force. If we do not now 
set ourselves this task and resolve to perform it, we shall be making 
an extremely big mistake. We are preparing to send 53,000 cadres 
south with the army, but this is a very small number. The occupation 
of eight or nine provinces and scores of big cities will require a huge 
number of working cadres, and to solve this problem the army must 
rely chiefly on itself. The army is a school. Our field armies of 
2,100,000 are equivalent to several thousand universities and secondary 
schools. We have to rely chiefly on the army to supply our working 
cadres. You must understand this point clearly. Since severe fighting 
is basically over, replenishment of the army¹s manpower and 
equipment should be kept within suitable limits, and too much must 
* This telegram was written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the Revolutionary 
Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
in reply to one from the Second and Third Field Armies. It was sent also to the 
other field armies concerned and to the bureaus of the Central Committee concerned. 
Considering that the period of severe fighting had ended after the three great campaigns 
of Liaohsi-Shenyang, Huai-Hai and Peiping-Tientsin, Comrade Mao Tse-tung 
in this telegram pointed out in good time that the People¹s Liberation Army was not 
only a fighting force but at the same time had to be a working force and that under 
certain conditions it should function mainly as a working force. This policy played 
a very important role in solving the cadre problem of that period in the new Liberated 
Areas and in ensuring the smooth development of the people¹s revolutionary cause. 
On the nature of the People¹s Liberation Army as both a fighting and a working 
force, see also ³Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China², Section 2, pp. 362-63 of this volume.

not be demanded as regards quantity, quality and completeness, lest 
this should cause financial crisis. That is another point you should 
seriously consider. The above policies apply fully to the Fourth Field 
Army, and Comrades Lin Piao and Lo Jung-huan are likewise asked 
to pay attention to them. We have talked at length with Comrade 
Kang Sheng and asked him to hurry to your place by the 12th to confer 
with you. After conferring, please inform us promptly by telegram 
of your views and what you propose to do. The Eastern China 
Bureau and the Eastern China Military Area Headquarters should 
move at once to Hsuchow to work jointly with the General Front 
Committee2 and with the Front Committee of the Third Field Army 
in a concentrated effort to plan the march to the south. Turn all your 
rear-area work over to the Shantung Sub-Bureau. 
NOTES 
1 The Second and Third Field Armies had planned to advance the date of 
crossing the Yangtse River from April to March 1949. The crossing was postponed 
to late April because of the peace negotiations with the reactionary Kuomintang 
government. 
2 In order to meet the needs of the Huai-Hai campaign, the Revolutionary 
Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
decided on November 16, 1948 to form a General Front Committee consisting of 
Comrades Liu Po-cheng, Chen Yi, Teng Hsiao-ping, Su Yu and Tan Chen-lin, with 
Comrade Teng Hsiao-ping as secretary, to assume unified leadership of the Central 
Plains Field Army and the Eastern China Field Army and to exercise command 
over military affairs and operations on the Huai-Hai front.


WHY DO THE BADLY SPLIT REACTIONARIES 
STILL IDLY CLAMOUR FOR 
³TOTAL PEACE²? 
February 15, 1949
The reactionary Kuomintang rule is collapsing more rapidly than 
was expected. It is only a little over four months since the People¹s 
Liberation Army captured Tsinan and only a little over three months 
since it captured Shenyang, but all the remnant forces of the Kuomintang 
in the military, political, economic, cultural and propaganda fields 
are already hopelessly split and disintegrated. The general collapse 
of Kuomintang rule began with the Liaohsi-Shenyang and Peiping- 
Tientsin campaigns on the northern front and the Huai-Hai campaign 
on the southern front. In less than four months, from early October 
last year to the end of January this year, these three campaigns cost 
the Kuomintang a total of more than 1,540,000 men, including 144 entire 
divisions of its regular army. The general collapse of Kuomintang 
rule is the inevitable outcome of the great victories of the Chinese 
People¹s War of Liberation and of the revolutionary movement of the 
Chinese people, but the clamour for ³peace² by the Kuomintang and 
its U.S. masters has played a considerable part in hastening this collapse. 
On January 1 of this year, the Kuomintang reactionaries began 
to lift a rock called the ³peace offensive²; they intended to hurl it 
at the Chinese people, but now it has dropped on their own feet. 
To be more exact, the rock has smashed the Kuomintang to pieces. 
Besides General Fu Tso-yi, who has helped the People¹s Liberation 
Army to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Peiping question, there 
are plenty of people everywhere who hope for a peaceful settlement. 
The Americans are looking on in impotent fury because their brats 
have failed them. In fact, this magic weapon, the peace offensive, 
was made in U.S. factories and was delivered to the Kuomintang more 
than half a year ago. It was Leighton Stuart himself who let out the 
341

342 MAO TSE-TUNG 
secret. After Chiang Kai-shek issued his so-called New Year¹s Day 
message, Stuart told a correspondent of the Central News Agency that 
this was ³what I myself have consistently worked for². According to 
U.S. news agencies, that correspondent lost his rice bowl for publishing 
this ³off the record² remark. The reason the Chiang Kai-shek 
clique did not dare to obey this American order for quite a long time 
was clearly explained in a directive issued by the Propaganda 
Department of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee on 
December 27, 1948: 
If we cannot fight, we cannot make peace. If we can fight, 
then to talk about peace will only demoralize the troops and the 
people. Hence, whether we can fight or not, we have everything 
to lose and nothing to gain by talking about peace. 
The Kuomintang issued this directive at that time because some Kuomintang 
factions other than Chiang¹s were already advocating peace 
talks. Last December 25, Pai Chung-hsi and the Hupeh Provincial 
Council under his direction raised the question of a ³peaceful settlement²
1 with Chiang Kai-shek, who was compelled to issue a statement 
on January 1 about holding peace negotiations on the basis of his five 
terms. He hoped to snatch the patent for inventing the peace offensive 
from Pai Chung-hsi and to continue his old rule under a new 
trade mark. On January 8 he sent Chang Chun to Hankow to enlist 
the support of Pai Chung-hsi and on the same day he asked the governments 
of the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union 
to intervene in China¹s civil war.2 But all these moves failed 
completely. The statement by Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the Communist 
Party of China on January 14 dealt a fatal blow to Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s plot for a sham peace and compelled him to ³retire² backstage 
a week later. Although Chiang Kai-shek and Li Tsung-jen 
and the Americans had made all kinds of arrangements for this plot 
and hoped to put on a fairly good puppet show, the result was contrary 
to their expectations; not only did the audience dwindle, but even the 
actors themselves vanished from the stage one after another. In 
Fenghua, Chiang Kai-shek continues to direct his remnant forces in 
his ³status of retirement², but he has lost his legal status and those 
people who believe in him are getting fewer and fewer. On its own 
initiative, Sun Fo¹s ³Executive Yuan² has proclaimed ³the moving 
of the Government to Canton²; it has broken away not only from the 
³president² and ³acting president² of the government but also from

343 REACTIONARIES CLAMOUR FOR ³TOTAL PEACE² 
the ³Legislative Yuan² and ³Control Yuan². Sun Fo¹s ³Executive 
Yuan² calls for war,3 but the ³Ministry of National Defence², which 
is charged with conducting the war, is neither in Canton nor in Nanking, 
and the only thing that is known of it is that its spokesman is 
in Shanghai. Thus, all that is left for Li Tsung-jen to see from the ramparts 
of the ³Stone City² is, 
The sky br ooding low over the land of Wu and Chu, 
With nothing between to meet the eye .4 
None of the orders issued by Li Tsung-jen since he assumed office on 
January 21 has been carried out. Although the Kuomintang no longer 
has any ³total² ³government² and although activities for local peace 
are going on in many places, the Kuomintang die-hards oppose local 
peace and demand a so-called ³total peace², and they actually aim 
at rejecting peace in the vain hope of carrying on the war; they are 
terribly afraid that these local peace activities will spread and get out 
of hand. The farce of the badly split and disintegrating Kuomintang¹s 
demand for a ³total peace² reached its climax in the statement issued 
on February 9 in Shanghai by the war criminal Teng Wen-yi, head of 
the Bureau for Political Work of the bogus Ministry of National Defence. 
Like Sun Fo, Teng Wen-yi repudiated Li Tsung-jen¹s January 
22 statement, which accepted the eight terms of the Communist Party 
of China as the basis for peace negotiations; instead he demanded a 
so-called ³peace on an equal footing, a total peace², failing which, he 
said, ³we will stop at no sacrifices in order to fight the Communists 
to the bitter end². But Teng Wen-yi failed to mention with whom 
we, his opponents, should now negotiate for a ³peace on an equal 
footing, a total peace². It seems that to approach Teng Wen-yi will 
get us nowhere and that not to approach Teng Wen-yi or anyone else 
will also get us nowhere. How very trying this is! According to a 
Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on February 9: 
Teng Wen-yi was asked by a reporter, ³Has Acting President 
Li approved the four points in your public statement?²5 Teng 
Wen-yi answered, ³I am speaking from the stand of the Ministry 
of National Defence, and the four points made today were not 
submitted beforehand to Acting President Li.² 
Here, Teng Wen-yi is not only inventing a partial stand of the bogus 
Ministry of National Defence, as distinct from the total stand of the 
bogus Kuomintang government, but is in fact inventing a smaller

344 MAO TSE-TUNG 
partial stand of the Bureau for Political Work of the bogus Ministry 
of National Defence, as distinct from the larger partial stand of the 
bogus Ministry of National Defence. For Teng Wen-yi openly opposes 
and maligns the peaceful settlement in Peiping, while the bogus 
Ministry of National Defence hailed it on January 27 as an act ³to 
shorten the war, secure peace and thereby preserve the foundations 
of the ancient capital, Peiping, and its cultural objects and historic 
monuments² and declared that ³cessation of hostilities will be effected² 
in the same way in places like Tatung and Suiyuan.6 From this it 
can be seen that those reactionaries who are the most energetic in their 
clamour for ³total peace² are the very reactionaries with the least 
total stand. A Bureau for Political Work of the Ministry of National 
Defence can contradict the Ministry of National Defence as 
well as the acting president. These reactionaries are the greatest 
obstacle to the realization of peace in China today. They dream of 
agitating for a total war under the slogan of a ³total peace²; in their 
own words, ³if there is to be war, let it be a total war; if there is to 
be peace, let it be a total peace.² But as a matter of fact they have 
neither the power to bring about a total peace nor the power to wage 
a total war. Total power is in the hands of the Chinese people, the 
Chinese People¹s Liberation Army, the Communist Party of China and 
the other democratic parties, not in the hands of the badly split and 
disintegrating Kuomintang. One side wields total power, while the 
other is hopelessly split and disintegrated, and this is the result of the 
prolonged struggle of the Chinese people and the prolonged evil-doing 
of the Kuomintang. No serious person can ignore this basic fact of 
the political situation in China today. 
NOTES 
1 Taking advantage of the extremely unfavourable situation then facing Chiang 
Kai-shek, Pai Chung-hsi, Commander-in-Chief of the Central China ³Bandit Suppression¹ 
Headquarters of the Kuomintang, proposed a ³peaceful settlement² of the 
civil war to Chiang, with the purpose of forcing him to step down and of raising 
the position of the Kwangsi clique to which Pai belonged. Under Pai Chung-hsi¹s 
direction the bogus Hupeh Provincial Council sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, 
warning him that ³if the disaster of war continues to spread and no attempt is made 
to change the course immediately, both the state and the people will be ruined², 
and advising him to ³follow the normal course of political settlement and seek ways 
to resume peace negotiations².

345 REACTIONARIES CLAMOUR FOR ³TOTAL PEACE² 
2 The request for intervention was rejected by the governments of the United 
States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union. In its aide-mémoire to the Kuomintang 
government on January 12, the U.S. government explained that the United States 
had rejected the request of the Kuomintang government because ³it is not believed that 
any useful purpose would be served². This meant that the U.S. government was 
already aware that it could no longer avert the doom of the reactionary Chiang 
Kai-shek regime it had fostered. 
3 On February 6 and 7, 1949, Sun Fo, president of the bogus Executive Yuan 
of the Kuomintang government, made two statements at Canton opposing Li Tsung-jen¹s 
statement about accepting the eight terms for peace put forward by the Communist 
Party of China as the basis for negotiations. He said that ³the Government has 
begun functioning in Canton where it has moved, and we should make a critical 
review of our past². He also said that ³the term on the punishment of war criminals 
proposed by the Communists is absolutely unacceptable². 
4 Lines from an ode by the 14th century Chinese poet, Sadul, of the Yuan 
Dynasty. The first half of the ode reads: 
From the ramparts of the Stone City 
One sees the sky br ooding low over the land of Wu and Chu, 
With nothing between to meet the eye. 
Pointing to strategic points famous in the Six Dynasties, 
Only the green bills stand like walls. 
Where army flags blotted the sun 
And masts of war vessels touched the clouds 
Snow-white skeletons lie scattered. 
North and south of the River 
How many warriors died! 
The ³Stone City² was an ancient name for Nanking. 
5 In his written statement on the ³Development of Peace and War², Teng 
Wen-yi set forth the following ³four points²: (1) ³The Government wants peace²; 
(2) ³The Chinese Communist Party wants war²; (3) ³The local peace at Peiping has 
become a hoax²; (4) ³We will stop at no sacrifices in order to fight the Communists 
to the bitter end². 
6 After the liberation of Tientsin and Peiping, only a few isolated strong-points 
in northern China remained in the hands of the Kuomintang forces. They included 
Taiyuan, Tatung, Hsinhsiang, Anyang and Kueisui. The enemy at Taiyuan was 
completely wiped out on April 24, 1949. The enemy at Tatung submitted to peaceful 
reorganization on May 1. The enemy at Hsinhsiang surrendered on May 5. The 
enemy at Anyang was wiped out on May 6. Kueisui was peacefully liberated on 
September 19.


THE KUOMINTANG REACTIONARIES 
TURN FROM AN ³APPEAL FOR PEACE² 
TO AN APPEAL FOR WAR 
February 16, 1949
From the time the bandit Chiang Kai-shek launched his peace offensive 
on January 1, the heroes of the reactionary Kuomintang clique 
kept on repeating at great length their willingness to ³shorten the 
duration of the war², ³alleviate the sufferings of the people² and ³treat 
the salvation of the people as the primary consideration². But early 
in February they suddenly began to play down their peace tune and 
strike up the old tune of ³fighting the Communists to the bitter end². 
This has been especially so in the last few days. On February 13 
the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang Central Executive 
Committee issued a ³Special Directive for Propaganda² to ³all party 
headquarters and party papers² which stated: 
Yeh Chien-ying has been spreading propaganda over our rear 
areas about the Chinese Communist Party¹s good faith in seeking 
peace, while condemning the Government¹s military moves as 
showing a lack of good faith in seeking peace. All our papers 
must emphatically refute this, directly and indirectly, in accordance 
with the following points. 
The ³Special Directive² gives quite a number of reasons why this 
³refutation² should be made: 
Rather than surrender unconditionally, the Government should 
fight to the bitter end. 
The eight terms Mao Tse-tung put forward in his January 14 
statement would ruin the nation, and the Government should not 
have accepted them. 
The Communist Party of China should bear the responsibility 
for wrecking peace. Instead, it has now drawn up a list of 
347

348 MAO TSE-TUNG 
so-called war criminals which includes all the Government leaders 
and has even demanded that the Government first arrest them; 
this clearly shows how truculent and unreasonable the Communist 
Party is. Unless the Communist Party of China changes 
this behaviour, it will indeed be difficult to find a way to peace 
negotiations. 
There is no more of the pathetic anxiety for peace negotiations of 
two weeks ago. There is no further mention of those famous phrases, 
³shorten the duration of the war², ³alleviate the sufferings of the 
people² and ³treat the salvation of the people as the primary consideration², 
phrases which gladdened the heart and spread everywhere. 
If the Communist Party of China is unwilling to change its ³behaviour² 
and insists on the punishment of the war criminals, then peace talks 
will be impossible. Which, then, is the primary consideration ‹ 
the salvation of the people or the salvation of the war criminals? According 
to the ³Special Directive for Propaganda² issued by these 
heroes of the Kuomintang, they prefer the latter. The Communist 
Party of China is still consulting the democratic parties and people¹s 
organizations about the list of war criminals, and opinions have now 
been received from several quarters. Judging by the opinions so far 
received, they all disapprove of the list put forward on December 25 
last year by an authoritative person in the Communist Party of China. 
They consider that a list containing the names of only forty-three war 
criminals is too short; they consider that those to be held responsible 
for launching the counter-revolutionary war and butchering several 
million people should certainly not be limited to forty-three, but should 
be well over a hundred. For the time being, let us suppose that the 
number of war criminals will be set at well over a hundred. Then we 
should like to ask the heroes of the Kuomintang, why do you oppose 
the punishment of war criminals? Aren¹t you willing to ³shorten the 
duration of the war² and ³alleviate the sufferings of the people²? If 
the war continues because of this opposition of yours, won¹t that be 
stalling for time and prolonging the disaster of war? ³Stalling for time 
and prolonging the disaster of war² was the very accusation you made 
against the Communist Party of China in the statement issued in the 
name of the Nanking government spokesman on January 26, 1949; 
can it be that now you want to take it back, write it on a placard 
and hang it on yourselves as a badge of honour? You are men of 
infinite compassion and mercy, who profess to ³treat the salvation of

349 KUOMINTANG TURNS FROM ³APPEAL FOR PEACE² TO WAR 
the people as the primary consideration². Then why do you suddenly 
change and treat the salvation of the war criminals as the primary 
consideration? According to the statistics of your government¹s 
Ministry of the Interior, the number of the Chinese people is not 450 
million, but 475 million; compare that with 100 odd war criminals ‹ 
which number is bigger? You heroes have studied arithmetic; please 
do a careful sum in accordance with your arithmetic textbook and 
then draw your conclusion. If, without doing this sum, you hastily 
change your original formula of ³treating the salvation of the people 
as the primary consideration² ‹ a good formula with which we agree 
and the people of the whole country agree ‹ into the formula of 
³treating the salvation of more than a hundred war criminals as the 
primary consideration², then be careful, for you certainly will not be 
able to maintain your ground. After having ³appealed for peace² 
over several weeks, those individuals who have repeatedly mouthed 
the phrase, ³treat the salvation of the people as the primary consideration², 
are no longer ³appealing for peace² but are appealing for war. 
The reason the Kuomintang die-hards are in trouble is this: they have 
stubbornly opposed the people, ridden roughshod over them and thus 
have isolated themselves on the pinnacle of a pagoda; moreover, they 
will not repent, even unto death. All you broad masses of the people 
of the Yangtse valley and the south ‹ workers, peasants, intellectuals, 
urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry and 
Kuomintang members with a conscience ‹ your attention, please! The 
days of the Kuomintang die-hards who have been riding roughshod 
over you are numbered. You and we are on the same side. The 
handful of die-hards will soon topple from their pinnacle, and a people¹s 
China will soon emerge.


ON THE KUOMINTANG¹S DIFFERENT ANSWERS 
TO THE QUESTION OF 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR 
February 18, 1949
³After the conclusion of the War of Resistance, the Government, 
following a policy of peace and national reconstruction, 
endeavoured to solve peacefully the problem of the Communist 
Party of China. For a period of a year and a half the Communist 
Party of China broke every agreement and therefore it should 
bear the responsibility for wrecking peace. Instead, it has now 
drawn up a list of so-called war criminals which includes all the 
Government leaders and has even demanded that the Government 
first arrest them; this clearly shows how truculent and unreasonable 
the Communist Party is. Unless the Communist Party of China 
changes this behaviour, it will indeed be difficult to find a way to 
peace negotiations.² 
The above is the entire argument on the question of the responsibility 
for the war which the Propaganda Department of the Central Executive 
Committee of the Kuomintang advanced in a ³Special Directive 
for Propaganda², issued on February 13, 1949. 
It is the argument of none other than War Criminal No. 1, Chiang 
Kai-shek. In his New Year¹s Day statement he said: 
As a devoted adherent of the Three People¹s Principles and 
the teachings of the Father of the Republic, I was reluctant to 
follow the conclusion of the war against Japan with the armed 
suppression of the bandits and thereby to aggravate the sufferings 
of the people. Therefore, as soon as the War of Resistance came 
to an end, our Government proclaimed its policy of peace and 
national reconstruction and moreover sought to solve the Communist 
problem by means of political consultation and military 
351

352 MAO TSE-TUNG 
mediation. But contrary to our expectations, the Communist 
Party for a period of a year and a half wilfully obstructed all 
agreements and proposals and made it impossible to carry them 
out by the measures which were originally intended. Finally, it 
even started an all-out armed rebellion which threatened the very 
existence of the state. This Government was thus driven to the 
painful necessity of mobilization to put down the rebellion. 
On December 25, 1948, seven days before Chiang Kai-shek made 
this statement, an authoritative person in the Communist Party of 
China put forward a list of forty-three war criminals and illustrious 
at the head of the list was none other than this same Chiang Kaishek. 
The war criminals, who want both to sue for peace and to 
shirk their responsibility, have no alternative but to shift the blame 
onto the Communist Party. But the two are irreconcilable. Since 
the Communist Party should bear the responsibility for launching the 
war, then the Communist Party should be punished. Since the Communists 
are ³bandits², then the ³bandits² should be ³suppressed². 
Since they ³started an all-out armed rebellion², then the ³rebellion² 
should be ³put down². ³Bandit suppression² and ³the putting down 
of rebellion² are a hundred per cent right, so why should they be 
abandoned? Why has the term ³Communist bandits² been changed 
into ³Communist Party² in all Kuomintang public documents issued 
since January 1, 1949? 
Sun Fo, feeling that something was amiss, put forward a different 
argument about the responsibility for the war in a speech broadcast 
on the evening of the same day Chiang Kai-shek issued his New 
Year¹s Day statement. Sun Fo said: 
We remember that in the early period following the victory of 
the War of Resistance, three years ago, because the people needed 
rehabilitation, the country needed active reconstruction and there 
was still common understanding of these needs among the various 
parties, we called together representatives from various quarters and 
public personages for a Political Consultative Conference. After 
three weeks¹ effort and thanks especially to the kind mediation of 
Mr. Marshall, President Truman¹s special envoy, we agreed upon 
a programme for peace and national reconstruction and upon 
specific measures for settling various disputes. If we had then 
carried out all these measures in good time, just think how prosperous 
China would be today, and how happy her people would

353 KUOMINTANG¹S ANSWERS ABOUT WAR RESPONSIBILITY 
be! Unfortunately, at the time none of the various parties concerned 
would entirely forgo its selfish interests, the people throughout 
the country did not exert themselves to the utmost to promote 
the success of the peace movement, and so the disaster of war again 
occurred, plunging the people into misery and suffering. 
Sun Fo is a little bit more ³fair² than Chiang Kai-shek. You see, 
unlike Chiang Kai-shek, he does not shift the responsibility for the 
war entirely onto the Communist Party, but divides the blame equally 
among ³the various parties concerned² by the method of ³equalization 
of landownership².1 Those involved are the Kuomintang, also the 
Communist Party, also the Democratic League and also the public 
personages. That isn¹t all; ³the people throughout the country² are also 
involved; not one of our 475 million fellow-countrymen can escape 
responsibility. While Chiang Kai-shek caned the Communist Party 
alone, Sun Fo canes all the parties, all the people without party 
affiliation, every one of his fellow-countrymen; even Chiang Kai-shek, 
and perhaps even Sun Fo himself, will get a caning. Here you see 
two Kuomintangites at loggerheads, Sun Fo and Chiang Kai-shek. 
A third Kuomintangite has come forward, saying, ³No, in my 
opinion, the responsibility should be borne entirely by the Kuomintang.² 
His name is Li Tsung-jen. On January 22, 1949, Li Tsung-jen 
issued a statement in his capacity as ³acting president². Regarding 
the responsibility for the war, he said: 
The three years¹ civil war that followed the eight years¹ War 
of Resistance has not only completely destroyed the country¹s last 
hope of recovery after the victory in the War of Resistance but 
has also spread ruin everywhere north and south of the Yellow 
River, devastating innumerable farmsteads and houses, killing and 
wounding thousands upon thousands of innocent people, breaking 
up countless families and causing people everywhere to lament in 
hunger and cold. Such a terrible holocaust is really without 
parallel in the history of civil wars in our country. 
Here Li Tsung-jen makes a statement but names no names; he 
fixes the responsibility neither on the Kuomintang, nor on the Communist 
Party, nor on any other quarter; yet he has stated one fact, that 
this ³terrible holocaust² has occurred in no other place than ³north 
and south of the Yellow River². Wherefore, let us examine who 
caused this ³terrible holocaust² in the area from the Yellow River

354 MAO TSE-TUNG 
south to the Yangtse River and north to the Sungari River. Could 
it have been caused by the people and the people¹s army there, fighting 
among themselves? Since Li Tsung-jen was once Chief of Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s Peiping Headquarters and since the troops of his Kwangsi 
clique together with Chiang¹s troops once fought into the Yi-Meng 
mountain area in Shantung Province,2 he has reliable information 
about where and how this ³holocaust² took place. If there is nothing 
else good about Li Tsung-jen, at least it is good that he has made this 
one honest statement. What is more, instead of speaking about ³putting 
down the rebellion² or ³suppressing the bandits², he calls the 
war a ³civil war², and this, for the Kuomintang, may be said to be 
quite novel. 
Following his own logic, Li Tsung-jen declared in the same statement 
that ³the Government is willing to start negotiations immediately 
on the basis of the eight terms proposed by the Communist Party of 
China². Li Tsung-jen knows that the first of the eight terms is the 
punishment of war criminals and that his own honourable name is 
among them. That the war criminals should be punished is a logical 
conclusion from the ³holocaust². For this reason the Kuomintang 
die-hards are even now muttering complaints against Li Tsung-jen, 
saying that ³the eight terms Mao Tse-tung put forward in his January 
14 statement would ruin the nation, and the Government should not 
have accepted them². 
There are reasons why the die-hards can only mutter and dare 
not speak out openly. Before Chiang Kai-shek ³retired², the diehards 
had thought of rejecting our eight terms, but then Chiang 
Kai-shek on second thoughts decided not to do so, probably because 
he considered that to reject them would leave no way out; this was 
the state of affairs on January 19. On that morning, Chang Chun-mai3 
upon his return-to Shanghai from Nanking said that ³the Government 
may issue another statement soon in reply to the eight terms 
put forward by the Communist Party of China², whereupon the Central 
News Agency sent a service message the same evening, saying: 
Add the following note to the Shanghai dispatch on Chang 
Chun-mai¹s statement that has just come through. As regards 
his assertion that the Government will soon issue another statement, 
a Central News Agency correspondent has just learned from 
the quarters concerned that the Government has no intention of 
making another statement.

355 KUOMINTANG¹S ANSWERS ABOUT WAR RESPONSIBILITY 
In the January 21 statement on his ³retirement², Chiang Kai-shek said 
not a single word in criticism of the eight terms and even revoked his 
own five terms, changing them into ³attaining peace on the principle 
that the integrity of territory and sovereignty is maintained, that the 
historic culture and social order are not destroyed and that the people¹s 
livelihood and right to freedom are safeguarded². He no longer dared 
raise such matters as the constitution, the legally constituted authority 
or the army. That is why on January 22 Li Tsung-jen dared to accept 
the eight terms of the Communist Party of China as the basis for 
negotiations and why the Kuomintang die-hards dared not openly 
reject them, but could only mutter that ³the Government should not 
have accepted them². 
Did Sun Fo consistently maintain his policy of ³equalization of 
landownership²? No. After he ³moved the Government to Canton² 
on February 5, 1949, he made a speech on February 7 about the question 
of war responsibility, saying: 
In the last six months the spread of the disaster of war has 
brought about serious changes in the situation and inflicted untold 
suffering on the people. All this has its origin in past mistakes, 
failures and unreasonableness, and today¹s grave situation is the 
consequence. We are all convinced that China needs the Three 
People¹s Principles. So long as the Three People¹s Principles are 
not put into effect, China¹s problems can never be solved. It 
may be recalled that twenty years ago the Tsungli of our party 
personally entrusted the Three People¹s Principles to our party 
as his legacy in the hope that they would be put into effect step 
by step. If they had been put into effect, the situation would 
never have developed into such a hopeless mess. 
People will please note that here the president of the Executive Yuan 
of the Kuomintang government is not apportioning responsibility 
for the war equally among the various parties and all his fellowcountrymen 
but is putting it on the Kuomintang itself. It makes 
people feel exceedingly good to see Sun Fo applying the cane to the 
backside of the Kuomintang alone. What about the Communist Party? 
President Sun says: 
We can see that the Communist Party of China has been able 
to lure and dupe the people merely by appealing for the equalization 
of landownership, which is one part of the Three People¹s 
Principles, the Principle of the People¹s Livelihood. We ought to

356 MAO TSE-TUNG 
feel deeply ashamed, sharpen our vigilance and examine afresh 
our past mistakes. 
Thank you, dear President! Although the Communist Party is still 
charged with the crime of ³luring and duping the people², at least 
it is innocent of other horrible crimes and hence escapes a caning and 
is let off with its head and its backside unscathed. 
Nor is President Sun lovable for this reason alone. In the same 
speech, he says: 
The spread of Communist influence today is a result of our 
failure to put into effect the principles we believe in. Our party¹s 
greatest mistake in the past was that certain members worshipped 
force too much and scrambled for power among themselves, thus 
giving the enemy opportunities to sow dissension in our ranks. 
The conclusion of the eight years¹ War of Resistance should have 
been the occasion for realizing the country¹s peaceful unification, an 
opportunity of a thousand years, and originally the Government 
had a plan of settling domestic disputes by political means, but 
unfortunately it was not carried out. After years of war and 
chaos the people urgently needed rehabilitation. The renewal of 
armed conflict made life impossible for the people, and the suffering 
was great; it also lowered the morale of the troops and caused 
repeated military setbacks. In deference to the feelings of the 
people and because he realized that military means had failed to 
solve the problem, President Chiang issued a New Year¹s Day 
message calling for peace. 
Good! Here this war criminal Sun Fo has made a voluntary confession, 
and a frank and truthful one too, although he has not been 
arrested or caned. Who was it who worshipped force, launched the 
war and sued for peace only after military means had failed to solve 
the problem? None other than the Kuomintang, none other than 
Chiang Kai-shek himself. President Sun is very precise in his choice 
of words when he says that ³certain members² of his party worshipped 
force too much. This conforms with the demand of the 
Communist Party of China that only a certain number of Kuomintang 
members be punished and branded as war criminals, but no more than 
this number, and of course not its entire membership. 
So we have no dispute with Sun Fo over the number. We differ 
with him as to the conclusion to be drawn. We hold that ³certain 
members² of the Kuomintang must be punished as war criminals

357 KUOMINTANG¹S ANSWERS ABOUT WAR RESPONSIBILITY 
because they ³worshipped force² and caused the ³renewal of armed 
conflict², which ³made life impossible for the people². But Sun Fo 
does not agree. He says: 
In delaying the appointment of its delegation and constantly 
stalling for time, the Communist Party has shown that it also 
worships force, believes it has now become full-fledged and can 
conquer the whole country by force; it therefore refuses to cease 
hostilities as a first step. Its motive is all too clear. I hereby 
propose in all seriousness that in order to obtain lasting peace 
negotiations should be conducted by the two parties on an equal 
footing and that the terms should be fair and reasonable and 
acceptable to the people of the whole country. 
From this you can see that President Sun is not quite so lovable. He 
seems to think that the punishment of war criminals is not a fair and 
reasonable term. On the question of war criminals, his words reveal 
an attitude similar to that of the ³Special Directive for Propaganda² 
issued by the Kuomintang Propaganda Department on February 13, 
and similarly he only mutters and dares not openly object. He differs 
sharply from Li Tsung-jen who dares to accept the punishment of war 
criminals as one of the basic terms for negotiations. 
But there is still something lovable about President Sun, for he 
says that although the Communist Party ³also worships force², as 
shown by two points, ³delaying the appointment of its delegation² and 
³refusing to cease hostilities as a first step², yet it is not like the 
Kuomintang, which worshipped force as early as 1946 and unleashed 
a most cruel war. Well, the Communist Party has ³delayed the 
appointment of its delegation² because making a list of war criminals 
is an important matter, it must be ³acceptable to the people of the 
whole country² and a list that is too long or too short would be 
unrealistic and unacceptable to ³the people of the whole country² 
(whose ranks do not include the war criminals and their accomplices). 
This requires consultation with the democratic parties and 
people¹s organizations; it has therefore caused some ³stalling², and 
we were not able to appoint our delegates quickly, thus arousing the 
displeasure of Sun Fo and his like. But from this, one cannot jump 
to the conclusion that the Communist Party ³also worships force². 
It is probable that before long the list of war criminals will be published, 
our delegates named and the negotiations started; and then 
President Sun will not be able to say that we ³worship force².

358 MAO TSE-TUNG 
As for ³refusing to cease hostilities as a first step², this is a correct 
attitude adopted in obedience to President Chiang¹s New Year¹s Day 
message. In that message President Chiang said: 
As soon as the Communist Party has a sincere desire for peace 
and can give definite indications of this, the Government will 
certainly meet it in all sincerity and be willing to discuss concrete 
measures for ending hostilities and restoring peace. 
On January 19 Sun Fo¹s Executive Yuan passed a resolution in violation 
of Chiang Kai-shek¹s message, saying ³first, effect an immediate 
and unconditional cessation of hostilities, and then, appoint delegates 
to enter into peace negotiations². On January 21 a Chinese Communist 
Party spokesman sternly criticized this absurd resolution.4 
Curiously enough, the president of the Executive Yuan turned a deaf 
ear to the criticism and on February 7 again nonsensically said that the 
Communist Party¹s ³refusal to cease hostilities as a first step² was 
proof that it ³also worships force². Even such a war criminal as 
Chiang Kai-shek knows that without negotiations it is impossible to 
cease hostilities and restore peace; on this point Sun Fo is far behind 
Chiang Kai-shek. 
As is generally known, Sun Fo is listed as a war criminal because 
he has all along supported Chiang Kai-shek in launching and continuing 
the war. As late as June 22, 1947, he was still saying that 
a ³settlement will finally come, provided militarily we fight to the 
end² and that ³at present peace negotiations are out of the question, 
and the Government must crush the Communist Party of China or 
be overthrown by it².5 Sun Fo himself is one of those ³certain members² 
of the Kuomintang who worshipped force. But now he is 
making irresponsible and carping comments from the side-lines, as if 
he himself had never worshipped force and bore no responsibility for 
the failure to carry out the Three People¹s Principles. This is dishonest. 
Whether tried according to the law of the state or judged 
according to the party discipline of the Kuomintang, Sun Fo cannot 
escape the caning he deserves.

REPORT TO THE SECOND PLENARY SESSION 
OF THE SEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF 
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA* 
March 5, 1949
I 
With the conclusion of the Liaohsi-Shenyang, Huai-Hai and 
Peiping-Tientsin campaigns, the main force of the Kuomintang army 
has been destroyed. Only a million odd of its combat troops are left, 
dispersed over vast areas from Sinkiang to Taiwan and over extremely 
long fronts. From now on there can be only three patterns for disposing 
of these Kuomintang troops ‹ the Tientsin pattern, the Peiping pattern 
or the Suiyuan pattern.1 To dispose of the enemy forces by fighting, 
as we did in Tientsin, must still be the primary object of our attention 
and preparations. The commanders and fighters of the entire Chinese 
People¹s Liberation Army absolutely must not relax in the least their 
will to fight; any thinking that relaxes the will to fight and belittles 
the enemy is wrong. The possibility has increased for solutions on 
the Peiping pattern, that is, to compel enemy troops to reorganize 
peacefully, quickly and thoroughly into the People¹s Liberation Army 
in conformity with the latter ¹s system. For the purpose of rapidly 
eliminating the vestiges of counter-revolution and liquidating its 
political influence, this solution is not quite as effective as the solution 
by fighting. However, it is bound to occur and is unavoidable after 
the main force of the enemy has been destroyed; furthermore, it is 
advantageous to our army and the people because casualties and 
destruction can be avoided. Therefore, the leading comrades of the 
various field armies should all pay attention to this form of struggle 
and learn how to use it. This is one form of struggle, a form of struggle 
without bloodshed; it does not mean that problems can be solved 
361

362 MAO TSE-TUNG 
without struggle. The Suiyuan pattern is deliberately to keep part 
of the Kuomintang troops wholly or nearly intact, that is, to make temporary 
concessions to these troops in order to help win them over to our 
side or neutralize them politically. Thereby, we can concentrate our 
forces to finish off the main part of the remnant Kuomintang forces first 
and then, after a certain period (say, a few months, half a year or a year 
later), proceed to reorganize these troops into the People¹s Liberation 
Army in conformity with its system. That is another form of struggle. 
It will preserve more of the vestiges and political influence 
of counter-revolution than the Peiping form and for a longer period. 
But there is not the slightest doubt that they will eventually be 
eliminated. It must never be assumed that, once they yield to us, the 
counter-revolutionaries turn into revolutionaries, that their counterrevolutionary 
ideas and designs cease to exist. Definitely not. Many 
of the counter-revolutionaries will be remoulded, some will be sifted 
out, and certain die-hard counter-revolutionaries will be suppressed. 
II 
The People¹s Liberation Army is always a fighting force. Even 
after country-wide victory, our army will remain a fighting force during 
the historical period in which classes have not been abolished in our 
country and the imperialist system still exists in the world. On this 
point there should be no misunderstanding or wavering. The People¹s 
Liberation Army is also a working force; this will be the case especially 
when the Peiping or the Suiyuan pattern of solution is used in the 
* The Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its 
Second Plenary Session in Hsipaipo Village, Pingshan County, Hopei Province, from 
March 5 t o 13, 1949. Thirty-four members and nineteen alternate members of the 
Central Committee were present. This session, which was convened on the eve of the 
country-wide victory of the Chinese people¹s revolution, was extremely important. In 
his report at the session, Comrade Mao Tse-tung set forth policies to promote the speedy 
achievement of the country-wide victory of the revolution and to organize this victory. 
He explained that with this victory the centre of gravity of the Party¹s work should 
be shifted from the village to the city, defined the basic political, economic and 
foreign policies the Party should adopt after victory and set the general tasks and 
main course for transforming China from an agricultural into an industrial country, 
from a new-democratic into a socialist society. In particular, he analysed the current 
conditions in the different sectors of China¹s economy and the correct policies the 
Party had to adopt, pointed out the necessary ways to realize the socialist transforma

south. With the gradual decrease in hostilities, its function as a working 
force will increase. There is a possibility that before very long 
the entire People¹s Liberation Army will be turned into a working 
force, and we must take this possibility into account. The 53,000 
cadres now ready to leave with the army for the south are very inadequate 
for the vast new areas we shall soon hold, and we must prepare 
to turn all the field armies, 2,100,000 strong, into a working force. 
In that event, there will be enough cadres and the work can develop 
over large areas. We must look upon the field armies with their 
2,100,000 men as a gigantic school for cadres. 
III 
From 1927 to the present the centre of gravity of our work has 
been in the villages ‹ gathering strength in the villages, using the 
villages in order to surround the cities and then taking the cities. 
The period for this method of work has now ended. The period of 
³from the city to the village² and of the city leading the village has 
now begun. The centre of gravity of the Party¹s work has shifted 
from the village to the city. In the south the People¹s Liberation 
Army will occupy first the cities and then the villages. Attention 
must be given to both city and village and it is necessary to link closely 
urban and rural work, workers and peasants, industry and agriculture. 
Under no circumstances should the village be ignored and only the 
city given attention; such thinking is entirely wrong. Nevertheless, 
the centre of gravity of the work of the Party and the army must be 
tion in China, criticized various ³Left² and Right deviations on this question and 
expressed the firm conviction that China¹s economy would develop at a comparatively 
high speed. Comrade Mao Tse-tung appraised the new situation in the class struggle 
both at home and abroad following the victory of the Chinese people¹s democratic 
revolution and gave timely warning that the ³sugar-coated bullets² of the bourgeoisie 
would become the main danger to the proletariat. All this gives the document great 
significance for a long historical period. This report and his article On the People¹s 
Democratic Dictatorship, written in June of the same year, formed the basis for the 
policies embodied in the Common Programme adopted by the First Plenary Session 
of the Chinese People¹s Political Consultative Conference, which served as a provisional 
constitution after the founding of New China. The Second Plenary Session of the 
Seventh Central Committee of the Party adopted a resolution based on Comrade 
Mao Tse-tung¹s report. After the session, the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of China moved from Hsipaipo, Pingshan County, Hopei Province to Peiping.

364 MAO TSE-TUNG 
in the cities; we must do our utmost to learn how to administer and 
build the cities. In the cities we must learn how to wage political, 
economic and cultural struggles against the imperialists, the Kuomintang 
and the bourgeoisie and also how to wage diplomatic struggles 
against the imperialists. We must learn how to carry on overt struggles 
against them, we must also learn how to carry on covert struggles 
against them. If we do not pay attention to these problems, if we do 
not learn how to wage these struggles against them and win victory 
in the struggles, we shall be unable to maintain our political power, 
we shall be unable to stand on our feet, we shall fail. After the 
enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies 
without guns; they are bound to struggle desperately against us; we 
must never regard these enemies lightly. If we do not now raise and 
understand the problem in this way, we shall commit very grave 
mistakes. 
IV 
On whom shall we rely in our struggles in the cities? Some 
muddle-headed comrades think we should rely not on the working 
class but on the masses of the poor. Some comrades who are even more 
muddle-headed think we should rely on the bourgeoisie. As for the 
direction of industrial development, some muddle-headed comrades 
maintain that we should chiefly help the development of private enterprise 
and not state enterprise, whereas others hold the opposite view 
that it suffices to pay attention to state enterprise and that private 
enterprise is of little importance. We must criticize these muddled 
views. We must whole-heartedly rely on the working class, unite 
with the rest of the labouring masses, win over the intellectuals and 
win over to our side as many as possible of the national bourgeois 
elements and their representatives who can co-operate with us ‹ or 
neutralize them ‹ so that we can wage a determined struggle against 
the imperialists, the Kuomintang and the bureaucrat-capitalist class 
and defeat these enemies step by step. Meanwhile we shall set about 
our task of construction and learn, step by step, how to administer cities 
and restore and develop their production. Regarding the problem 
of restoring and developing production we must be clear about the 
following: first comes the production of state industry, second the

365 REPORT TO SECOND SESSION OF SEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
production of private industry and third handicraft production. From 
the very first day we take over a city, we should direct our attention 
to restoring and developing its production. We must not go about 
our work blindly and haphazardly and forget our central task, lest 
several months after taking over a city its production and construction 
should still not be on the right track and many industries should 
be at a standstill, with the result that the workers are unemployed, 
their livelihood deteriorates and they become dissatisfied with the 
Communist Party. Such a state of affairs is entirely impermissible. 
Therefore, our comrades must do their utmost to learn the techniques 
of production and the methods of managing production as well as 
other closely related work such as commerce and banking. Only when 
production in the cities is restored and developed, when consumer-cities 
are transformed into producer-cities, can the people¹s political power 
be consolidated. Other work in the cities, for example, in Party 
organization, in organs of political power, in trade unions and other 
people¹s organizations, in culture and education, in the suppression of 
counter-revolutionaries, in news agencies, newspapers and broadcasting 
stations ‹ all this work revolves around and serves the central task, 
production and construction. If we know nothing about production 
and do not master it quickly, if we cannot restore and develop production 
as speedily as possible and achieve solid successes so that the 
livelihood of the workers, first of all, and that of the people in general 
is improved, we shall be unable to maintain our political power, we 
shall be unable to stand on our feet, we shall fail. 
V 
Conditions in the south are different from those in the north, 
and the Party¹s tasks must also be different. The south is still under 
Kuomintang rule. There, the tasks of the Party and the People¹s 
Liberation Army are to wipe out the Kuomintang¹s reactionary armed 
forces in city and countryside, set up Party organizations, set up 
organs of political power, arouse the masses, establish trade unions, 
peasant associations and other people¹s organizations, build the people¹s 
armed forces, mop up the remnant Kuomintang forces and restore 
and develop production. In the countryside, our first tasks are to 
wage struggles step by step, to clean out the bandits and to oppose the

366 MAO TSE-TUNG 
local tyrants (the section of the landlord class in power) in order to 
complete preparations for the reduction of rent and interest; this 
reduction can then be accomplished within a year or two after the 
arrival of the People¹s Liberation Army, and the precondition for the 
distribution of land will thus be created. At the same time care must 
be taken to maintain the present level of agricultural production as far 
as possible and to prevent it from declining. In the north, except for 
the few new Liberated Areas, conditions are completely different. 
Here the Kuomintang rule has been overthrown, the people¹s rule has 
been established and the land problem has been fundamentally solved. 
Here the central task of the Party is to mobilize all forces to restore 
and develop production; this should be the centre of gravity in all 
work. It is also necessary to restore and develop cultural and educational 
work, wipe out the remnants of the reactionary forces, consolidate 
the entire north and support the People¹s Liberation Army. 
VI 
We have already carried out extensive economic construction, and 
the Party¹s economic policy has been implemented in practice and 
has achieved marked success. However, there are still many muddled 
views within the Party on the question of why we should adopt this 
kind of economic policy and not another, i.e., on a question of theory 
and principle. How should this question be answered? In our opinion, 
the answer should be as follows. Before the War of Resistance 
Against Japan, the proportions of industry and agriculture in the 
entire national economy of China were, modern industry about 10 
per cent, and agriculture and handicrafts about 90 per cent. This was 
the result of imperialist and feudal oppression; this was the economic 
expression of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal character of the society 
of old China; and this is our basic point of departure for all questions 
during the period of the Chinese revolution and for a fairly long period 
after victory. This gives rise to a series of problems regarding our 
Party¹s strategy, tactics and policy. An important task for our Party 
at present is to reach a clearer understanding of these problems and 
their solution. That is to say: 
1. China already has a modern industry constituting about 10 
per cent of her economy; this is progressive, this is different from

367 REPORT TO SECOND SESSION OF SEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
ancient times. As a result, China has new classes and new political 
parties ‹ the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, proletarian and bourgeois 
parties. The proletariat and its party, because they have been 
oppressed by manifold enemies, have become steeled and are qualified 
to lead the Chinese people¹s revolution. Whoever overlooks or belittles 
this point will commit Right opportunist mistakes. 
2. China still has scattered and individual agriculture and handicrafts, 
constituting about 90 per cent of her entire economy; this is 
backward, this is not very different from ancient times ‹ about 90 
per cent of our economic life remains the same as in ancient times. 
We have abolished, or will soon abolish, the age-old feudal ownership 
of land. In this respect, we have become, or will soon become, different 
from what we were in ancient times, and have or will soon 
have the possibility of modernizing our agriculture and handicrafts 
step by step. In their basic form, however, our agriculture and handicrafts 
today are still scattered and individual, somewhat as they were 
in ancient times, and they will remain so for a fairly long time to 
come. Whoever overlooks or belittles this point will commit ³Left² 
opportunist mistakes. 
3. China¹s modern industry, though the value of its output amounts 
to only about 10 per cent of the total value of output of the national 
economy, is extremely concentrated; the largest and most important 
part of the capital is concentrated in the hands of the imperialists and 
their lackeys, the Chinese bureaucrat-capitalists. The confiscation of 
this capital and its transfer to the people¹s republic led by the proletariat 
will enable the people¹s republic to control the economic 
lifelines of the country and will enable the state-owned economy to 
become the leading sector of the entire national economy. This sector 
of the economy is socialist, not capitalist, in character. Whoever 
overlooks or belittles this point will commit Right opportunist mistakes. 
4. China¹s private capitalist industry, which occupies second place 
in her modern industry, is a force which must not be ignored. Because 
they have been oppressed or hemmed in by imperialism, feudalism 
and bureaucrat-capitalism, the national bourgeoisie of China and its 
representatives have often taken part in the people¹s democratic revolutionary 
struggles or maintained a neutral stand. For this reason 
and because China¹s economy is still backward, there will be need, 
for a fairly long period after the victory of the revolution, to make 
use of the positive qualities of urban and rural private capitalism as 
far as possible, in the interest of developing the national economy.

their solution. That is to say: 
1. China already has a modern industry constituting about 10 
per cent of her economy; this is progressive, this is different from

369 REPORT TO SECOND SESSION OF SEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
developed. If there were only a state-owned economy and no cooperative 
economy, it would be impossible for us to lead the individual 
economy of the labouring people step by step towards collectivization, 
impossible to develop from the new-democratic society to the future 
socialist society and impossible to consolidate the leadership of the 
proletariat in the state power. Whoever overlooks or belittles this 
point will also commit extremely serious mistakes. The state-owned 
economy is socialist in character and the co-operative economy is 
semi-socialist; these plus private capitalism, plus the individual 
economy, plus the state-capitalist economy in which the state and 
private capitalists work jointly, will be the chief sectors of the economy 
of the people¹s republic and will constitute the new-democratic 
economic structure. 
6. The restoration and development of the national economy 
of the people¹s republic would be impossible without a policy of 
controlling foreign trade. When imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratcapitalism 
and the concentrated expression of all three, the Kuomintang 
regime, have been eliminated in China, the problem of establishing 
an independent and integrated industrial system will remain unsolved 
and it will be finally solved only when our country has greatly 
developed economically and changed from a backward agricultural 
into an advanced industrial country. It will be impossible to achieve 
this aim without controlling foreign trade. After the country-wide 
victory of the Chinese revolution and the solution of the land problem, 
two basic contradictions will still exist in China. The first is internal, 
that is, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. 
The second is external, that is, the contradiction between 
China and the imperialist countries. Consequently, after the victory 
of the people¹s democratic revolution, the state power of the people¹s 
republic under the leadership of the working class must not be weakened 
but must be strengthened. The two basic policies of the state in 
the economic struggle will be regulation of capital at home and control 
of foreign trade. Whoever overlooks or belittles this point will commit 
extremely serious mistakes. 
7. China has inherited a backward economy. But the Chinese 
people are brave and industrious. With the victory of the Chinese 
people¹s revolution and the founding of the people¹s republic, and with 
the leadership of the Communist Party of China, plus the support of 
the working class of the countries of the world and chiefly the support 
of the Soviet Union, the speed of China¹s economic construction will

370 MAO TSE-TUNG 
not be very slow, but may be fairly fast. The day is not far off when 
China will attain prosperity. There is absolutely no ground for 
pessimism about China¹s economic resurgence. 
VII 
Old China was a semi-colonial country under imperialist domination. 
Thoroughly anti-imperialist in character, the Chinese people¹s 
democratic revolution has incurred the bitter hatred of the imperialists 
who have done their utmost to help the Kuomintang. This has 
aroused the Chinese people to even deeper indignation against the 
imperialists and deprived them of their last shred of prestige among 
the Chinese people. At the same time the whole imperialist system 
is very much weakened after World War II, while the strength of 
the world anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union is greater 
than ever before. In these circumstances, we can and should adopt a 
policy of systematically and completely destroying imperialist domination 
in China. This imperialist domination manifests itself in the 
political, economic and cultural fields. In each city or place where the 
Kuomintang troops are wiped out and the Kuomintang government is 
overthrown, imperialist political domination is overthrown with it, 
and so is imperialist economic and cultural domination. But the 
economic and cultural establishments run directly by the imperialists 
are still there, and so are the diplomatic personnel and the journalists 
recognized by the Kuomintang. We must deal with all these properly 
in their order of urgency. Refuse to recognize the legal status of any 
foreign diplomatic establishments and personnel of the Kuomintang 
period, refuse to recognize all the treasonable treaties of the Kuomintang 
period, abolish all imperialist propaganda agencies in China, take 
immediate control of foreign trade and reform the customs system ‹ 
these are the first steps we must take upon entering the big cities. 
When they have acted thus, the Chinese people will have stood up 
in the face of imperialism. As for the remaining imperialist economic 
and cultural establishments, they can be allowed to exist for the time 
being, subject to our supervision and control, to be dealt with by 
us after country-wide victory. As for ordinary foreign nationals, their 
legitimate interests will be protected and not encroached upon. As 
for the question of the recognition of our country by the imperialist

371 REPORT TO SECOND SESSION OF SEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
countries, we should not be in a hurry to solve it now and need not 
be in a hurry to solve it even for a fairly long period after countrywide 
victory. We are willing to establish diplomatic relations with 
all countries on the principle of equality, but the imperialists, who 
have always been hostile to the Chinese people, will definitely not 
be in a hurry to treat us as equals. As long as the imperialist countries 
do not change their hostile attitude, we shall not grant them 
legal status in China. As for doing business with foreigners, there 
is no question; wherever there is business to do, we shall do it and 
we have already started; the businessmen of several capitalist countries 
are competing for such business. So far as possible, we must 
first of all trade with the socialist and people¹s democratic countries; 
at the same time we will also trade with capitalist countries. 
VII 
All the conditions are ripe for convening the Political Consultative 
Conference and forming a democratic coalition government. All the 
democratic parties, people¹s organizations and democrats without party 
affiliation are on our side. The bourgeoisie in Shanghai and in the 
Yangtse valley are trying to establish contacts with us. Navigation 
and postal communications between north and south have been 
resumed. The disintegrating Kuomintang has alienated itself from all 
the masses. We are preparing to have negotiations with the reactionary 
Nanking government.3 Its moving forces for negotiating with us 
are the warlords of the Kwangsi clique, those factions of the Kuomintang 
favouring peace and the Shanghai bourgeoisie. Their aims are to 
obtain a share in the coalition government, retain as many troops as 
possible, preserve the interests of the bourgeoisie in Shanghai and the 
south and do their best to moderate the revolution. These groups 
recognize our eight terms as the basis for negotiations, but they want to 
bargain so that their losses will not be too great. Those trying to 
wreck the negotiations are Chiang Kai-shek and his sworn followers. 
Chiang Kai-shek still has sixty divisions south of the Yangtse and they 
are preparing to fight. Our policy is not to refuse negotiations, but to 
demand that the other side accept the eight terms in their entirety and 
to allow no bargaining. In return, we would refrain from fighting 
the Kwangsi clique and the other Kuomintang factions which favour

372 MAO TSE-TUNG 
peace, postpone the reorganization of their troops for about a year, 
allow some individuals in the Nanking government to take part in 
the Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government 
and agree to protect certain interests of the bourgeoisie in Shanghai 
and in the south. The negotiations are to be on an over-all basis and, 
if successful, they will reduce many obstacles to our advance into the 
south and to the take-over of the big cities there, which will have great 
advantages. If they are not successful, then separate negotiations on 
a local basis will be held after our army advances. The negotiations 
on an over-all basis are tentatively fixed for late March. We hope to 
occupy Nanking by April or May, then convene the Political Consultative 
Conference in Peiping, form a coalition government and make 
Peiping the capital. Since we have agreed to hold negotiations, we 
should be prepared for the many troubles which will arise after the 
success of the negotiations, and we should be ready with clear heads 
to deal with the tactics the other side will adopt, the tactics of the 
Monkey who gets into the stomach of the Princess of the Iron Fan to 
play the devil.4 As long as we are fully prepared mentally, we can 
beat any devilish Monkey. Whether the peace negotiations are overall 
or local, we should be prepared for such an eventuality. We 
should not refuse to enter into negotiations because we are afraid of 
trouble and want to avoid complications, nor should we enter into 
negotiations with our minds in a haze. We should be firm in principle; 
we should also have all the flexibility permissible and necessary 
for carrying out our principles. 
IX 
The people¹s democratic dictatorship, led by the proletariat and 
based on the worker-peasant alliance, requires that our Party conscientiously 
unite the entire working class, the entire peasantry and 
the broad masses of revolutionary intellectuals; these are the leading 
and basic forces of the dictatorship. Without this unity, the dictatorship 
cannot be consolidated. It is also required that our Party unite 
with as many as possible of the representatives of the urban petty 
bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie who can co-operate with us and 
with their intellectuals and political groups, so that, during the revolutionary 
period, we can isolate the counter-revolutionary forces and 
completely overthrow both the counter-revolutionary and imperialist

373 REPORT TO SECOND SESSION OF SEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
forces in China and so that, after the victory of the revolution, 
we can speedily restore and develop production, cope with foreign 
imperialism, steadily transform China from an agricultural into an 
industrial country and build China into a great socialist state. Therefore, 
our Party¹s policy of long-term co-operation with non-Party 
democrats should be clearly established in the thinking and work of the 
whole Party. We must regard the majority of non-Party democrats 
as we do our own cadres, consult with them sincerely and frankly 
to solve those problems that call for consultation and solution, give 
them work, entrust them with the responsibility and authority that 
should go with their posts and help them do their work well. Proceeding 
from the desire to unite with them, we should carry out serious and 
appropriate criticism or struggle against their errors and shortcomings 
in order to attain the objective of unity. It would be wrong to adopt 
an accommodating attitude towards their errors or shortcomings. It 
would also be wrong to adopt a closed-door or perfunctory attitude 
towards them. In each big or medium city, each strategic region and 
each province, we should develop a group of non-Party democrats 
who have prestige and can co-operate with us. The incorrect attitude 
towards non-Party democrats, fostered by the closed-door style in 
our Party during the War of Agrarian Revolution, was not entirely 
overcome during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it reappeared 
in 1947 during the high tide of the land reform in the base 
areas. This attitude would serve only to isolate our Party, prevent 
the consolidation of the people¹s democratic dictatorship and enable the 
enemy to obtain allies. Now that China¹s first Political Consultative 
Conference under the leadership of our Party will soon be convened, 
that a democratic coalition government will soon be formed and that 
the revolution will soon be victorious throughout the country, the whole 
Party must make a serious and self-critical examination of this problem 
and understand it correctly; it must oppose the two deviations, the 
Right deviation of accommodation and the closed-door and perfunctory 
³Left² deviation, and adopt an entirely correct attitude. 
IX 
Very soon we shall be victorious throughout the country. This 
victory will breach the eastern front of imperialism and will have 
great international significance. To win this victory will not require

374 MAO TSE-TUNG 
much more time and effort, but to consolidate it will. The bourgeoisie 
doubts our ability to construct. The imperialists reckon that eventually 
we will beg alms from them in order to live. With victory, 
certain moods may grow within the Party ‹ arrogance, the airs of a 
self-styled hero, inertia and unwillingness to make progress, love of 
pleasure and distaste for continued hard living. With victory, the 
people will be grateful to us and the bourgeoisie will come forward to 
flatter us. It has been proved that the enemy cannot conquer us by 
force of arms. However, the flattery of the bourgeoisie may conquer 
the weak-willed in our ranks. There may be some Communists, who 
were not conquered by enemies with guns and were worthy of the 
name of heroes for standing up to these enemies, but who cannot withstand 
sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated by sugar-coated 
bullets. We must guard against such a situation. To win countrywide 
victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. 
Even if this step is worthy of pride, it is comparatively tiny; what 
will be more worthy of pride is yet to come. After several decades, 
the victory of the Chinese people¹s democratic revolution, viewed in 
retrospect, will seem like only a brief prologue to a long drama. A 
drama begins with a prologue, but the prologue is not the climax. 
The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution will 
be longer, the work greater and more arduous. This must be made 
clear now in the Party. The comrades must be taught to remain 
modest, prudent and free from arrogance and rashness in their style 
of work. The comrades must be taught to preserve the style of plain 
living and hard struggle. We have the Marxist-Leninist weapon of 
criticism and self-criticism. We can get rid of a bad style and keep 
the good. We can learn what we did not know. We are not only 
good at destroying the old world, we are also good at building the 
new. Not only can the Chinese people live without begging alms 
from the imperialists, they will live a better life than that in the 
imperialist countries. 
NOTES 
1 On September 19, 1949, Tung Chi-wu, Kuomintang governor of Suiyuan 
Province, and Sun Lan-feng, Kuomintang army commander, revolted and came over 
with more than forty thousand men. The regrouping of these units began on 
February 21, 1950, under the leadership of the Suiyuan Military Command of the 
People¹s Liberation Army. They were reorganized into the People¹s Liberation Army 
on April 10.

375 REPORT TO SECOND SESSION OF SEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
2 ³Regulation of capital² was one of Sun Yat-sen¹s well-known slogans. The 
Manifesto of the Kuomintang¹s First National Congress, in which the Kuomintang 
and the Communist Party co-operated, was published on January 23, 1924 and gave 
the following interpretation to this slogan: ³Private industries, whether of Chinese 
or of foreign nationals, which are either of a monopolistic nature or are beyond 
the capacity of private individuals to develop, such as banking, railways, and navigation, 
shall be undertaken by the state, so that privately owned capital shall not control 
the economic life of the people.² 
3 Concerning peace negotiations with the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang 
government, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made the 
following decisions on March 26, 1949: 
(1) Time for the negotiations to begin, April 1; 
(2) Place for the negotiations, Peiping; 
(3) Chou En-lai, Lin Po-chu, Lin Piao, Yeh Chien-ying and Li Wei-han 
are appointed as delegates (on April 1, the Central Committee decided to add 
Nieh Jung-chen to the list of delegates), with Chou En-lai as chief delegate, to 
negotiate with the Nanking delegation on the basis of Chairman Mao Tse-tung¹s 
Statement on the Present Situation made on January 14 and the eight terms set 
forth therein; 
(4) The reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government is to be immediately 
notified of the aforesaid by radio broadcast and told to send its delegation 
to the specified place, at the specified time and, in order to facilitate the negotiations, 
to bring all necessary material relating to the eight terms.

insect, found his way into the stomach of the Princess of the Iron Fan and thus defeated 
her, see the Chinese novel, Pilgrimage to the West, Chapter 59.


METHODS OF WORK OF PARTY COMMITTEES* 
March 13, 1949
1. The secretary of a Party committee must be good at being a 
³squad leader². A Party committee has ten to twenty members; it 
is like a squad in the army, and the secretary is like the ³squad leader². 
It is indeed not easy to lead this squad well. Each bureau or subbureau 
of the Central Committee now leads a vast area and shoulders 
very heavy responsibilities. To lead means not only to decide general 
and specific policies but also to devise correct methods of work. Even 
with correct general and specific policies, troubles may still arise if 
methods of work are neglected. To fulfil its task of exercising leadership, 
a Party committee must rely on its ³squad members² and 
enable them to play their parts to the full. To be a good ³squad 
leader², the secretary should study hard and investigate thoroughly. 
A secretary or deputy secretary will find it difficult to direct his ³squad² 
well if he does not take care to do propaganda and organizational 
work among his own ³squad members², is not good at handling his 
relations with committee members or does not study how to run meetings 
successfully. If the ³squad members² do not march in step, they 
can never expect to lead tens of millions of people in fighting and 
construction. Of course, the relation between the secretary and the 
committee members is one in which the minority must obey the majority, 
so it is different from the relation between a squad leader and 
his men. Here we speak only by way of analogy. 
2. Place problems on the table. This should be done not only 
by the ³squad leader² but by the committee members too. Do not 
talk behind people¹s backs. Whenever problems arise, call a meeting, 
place the problems on the table for discussion, take some decisions 
and the problems will be solved. If problems exist and are not 
placed on the table, they will remain unsolved for a long time and 
even drag on for years. The ³squad leader² and the committee 
members should show understanding in their relations with each other. 
377

378 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Nothing is more important than mutual understanding, support 
and friendship between the secretary and the committee members, 
between the Central Committee and its bureaus and between the 
bureaus and the area Party committees. In the past this point 
received little attention, but since the Seventh Party Congress much 
progress has been made in this respect and the ties of friendship and 
unity have been greatly strengthened. We should continue to pay 
constant attention to this point in the future. 
3. ³Exchange information.² This means that members of a 
Party committee should keep each other informed and exchange views 
on matters that have come to their attention. This is of great importance 
in achieving a common language. Some fail to do so and, 
like the people described by Lao Tzu, ³do not visit each other all 
their lives, though the crowing of their cocks and the barking of their 
dogs are within hearing of each other².1 The result is that they lack 
a common language. In the past some of our high-ranking cadres did 
not have a common language even on basic theoretical problems of 
Marxism-Leninism, because they had not studied enough. There is 
more of a common language in the Party today, but the problem has 
not yet been fully solved. For instance, in the land reform there is 
still some difference in the understanding of what is meant by ³middle 
peasants² and ³rich peasants². 
4. Ask your subordinates about matters you don¹t understand or 
don¹t know, and do not lightly express your approval or disapproval. 
Some documents, after having been drafted, are withheld from circulation 
for a time because certain questions in them need to be clarified 
and it is necessary to consult the lower levels first. We should never 
pretend to know what we don¹t know, we should ³not feel ashamed to 
ask and learn from people below²2 and we should listen carefully to the 
views of the cadres at the lower levels. Be a pupil before you become 
a teacher; learn from the cadres at the lower levels before you issue 
orders. In handling problems, this should be the practice of all bureaus 
of the Central Committee and Party committees of the fronts, except 
in military emergencies or when the facts of the matter are already 
clear. To do this will not lower one¹s prestige, but can only raise it. 
Since our decisions incorporate the correct views of the cadres at the 
lower levels, the latter will naturally support them. What the cadres 
at the lower levels say may or may not be correct; we must analyse it. 
* This was part of Comrade Mao Tse-tung¹s concluding speech at the Second 
Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

379 METHODS OF WORK OF PARTY COMMITTEES 
We must heed the correct views and act upon them. The reason 
why the leadership of the Central Committee is correct is chiefly that 
it synthesizes the material, reports and correct views coming from 
different localities. It would be difficult for the Central Committee 
to issue correct orders if the localities did not provide material and 
put forward opinions. Listen also to the mistaken views from below; 
it is wrong not to listen to them at all. Such views, however, are not 
to be acted upon but to be criticized. 
5. Learn to ³play the piano². In playing the piano all ten fingers 
are in motion; it won¹t do to move some fingers only and not others. 
But if all ten fingers press down at once, there is no melody. To 
produce good music, the ten fingers should move rhythmically and in 
co-ordination. A Party committee should keep a firm grasp on its 
central task and at the same time, around the central task, it should 
unfold the work in other fields. At present, we have to take care of 
many fields; we must look after the work in all the areas, armed units 
and departments, and not give all our attention to a few problems, to 
the exclusion of others. Wherever there is a problem, we must put 
our finger on it, and this is a method we must master. Some play the 
piano well and some badly, and there is a great difference in the 
melodies they produce. Members of Party committees must learn 
to ³play the piano² well. 
6. ³Grasp firmly.² That is to say, the Party committee must 
not merely ³grasp², but must ³grasp firmly², its main tasks. One 
can get a grip on something only when it is grasped firmly, without 
the slightest slackening. Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at all. 
Naturally, one cannot get a grip on something with an open hand. 
When the hand is clenched as if grasping something but is not clenched 
tightly, there is still no grip. Some of our comrades do grasp the 
main tasks, but their grasp is not firm and so they cannot make a 
success of their work. It will not do to have no grasp at all, nor will 
it do if the grasp is not firm. 
7. ²Have a head for figures.² That is to say, we must attend 
to the quantitative aspect of a situation or problem and make a 
basic quantitative analysis. Every quality manifests itself in a certain 
quantity, and without quantity there can be no quality. To this day 
many of our comrades still do not understand that they must attend 
to the quantitative aspect of things - the basic statistics, the main 
percentages and the quantitative limits that determine the qualities of 
things. They have no ³figures² in their heads and as a result cannot

380 MAO TSE-TUNG 
help making mistakes. For instance, in carrying out the land reform 
it is essential to have such figures as the percentages of landlords, rich 
peasants, middle peasants and poor peasants among the population 
and the amount of land owned by each group, because only on this 
basis can we formulate correct policies. Whom to call a rich peasant, 
whom a well-to-do middle peasant, and how much income derived from 
exploitation makes a person a rich peasant as distinct from a well-to-do 
middle peasant ‹ in all these cases too, the quantitative limits must be 
ascertained. In all mass movements we must make a basic investigation 
and analysis of the number of active supporters, opponents and 
neutrals and must not decide problems subjectively and without basis. 
8. ³Notice to Reassure the Public.² Notice of meetings should 
be given beforehand; this is like issuing a ³Notice to Reassure the 
Public², so that everybody will know what is going to be discussed and 
what problems are to be solved and can make timely preparations. In 
some places, meetings of cadres are called without first preparing 
reports and draft resolutions, and only when people have arrived for 
the meeting are makeshifts improvised; this is just like the saying, 
³Troops and horses have arrived, but food and fodder are not ready², 
and that is no good. Don¹t call a meeting in a hurry if the preparations 
are not completed. 
9. ³Fewer and better troops and simpler administration.² Talks, 
speeches, articles and resolutions should all be concise and to the 
point. Meetings also should not go on too long. 
10. Pay attention to uniting and working with comrades who 
differ with you. This should be borne in mind both in the localities and 
in the army. It also applies to relations with people outside the Party. 
We have come together from every corner of the country and should 
be good at uniting in our work not only with comrades who hold the 
same views as we but also with those who hold different views. There 
are some among us who have made very serious mistakes; we should 
not be prejudiced against them but should be ready to work with them. 
11. Guard against arrogance. For anyone in a leading position, 
this is a matter of principle and an important condition for maintaining 
unity. Even those who have made no serious mistakes and 
have achieved very great success in their work should not be arrogant. 
Celebration of the birthdays of Party leaders is forbidden. Naming 
places, streets and enterprises after Party leaders is likewise forbidden. 
We must keep to our style of plain living and hard work and put a 
stop to flattery and exaggerated praise.

381 METHODS OF WORK OF PARTY COMMITTEES 
12. Draw two lines of distinction. First, between revolution and 
counter-revolution, between Yenan and Sian.3 Some do not understand 
that they must draw this line of distinction. For example, when 
they combat bureaucracy, they speak of Yenan as though ³nothing 
is right² there and fail to make a comparison and distinguish between 
the bureaucracy in Yenan and the bureaucracy in Sian. This is 
fundamentally wrong. Secondly, within the revolutionary ranks, it 
is necessary to make a clear distinction between right and wrong, 
between achievements and shortcomings and to make clear which of 
the two is primary and which secondary. For instance, do the 
achievements amount to 30 per cent or to 70 per cent of the whole? 
It will not do either to understate or to overstate. We must have a 
fundamental evaluation of a person¹s work and establish whether his 
achievements amount to 30 per cent and his mistakes to 70 per cent, 
or vice versa. If his achievements amount to 70 per cent of the whole, 
then his work should in the main be approved. It would be entirely 
wrong to describe work in which the achievements are primary as 
work in which the mistakes are primary. In our approach to problems 
we must not forget to draw these two lines of distinction, between 
revolution and counter-revolution and between achievements and shortcomings. 
We shall be able to handle things well if we bear these two 
distinctions in mind; otherwise we shall confuse the nature of the 
problems. To draw these distinctions well, careful study and analysis 
are of course necessary. Our attitude towards every person and every 
matter should be one of analysis and study. 
The members of the Political Bureau and I personally feel that 
only by using the above methods can Party committees do their work 
well. In addition to conducting Party congresses well, it is most 
important for the Party committees at all levels to perform their 
work of leadership well. We must make efforts to study and perfect 
the methods of work so as to raise further the Party committees¹ level 
of leadership.

3 Yenan was the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China from January 1937 to March 1947; Sian was the centre of the reactionary 
rule of the Kuomintang in northwestern China. Comrade Mao Tse-tung cited the 
two cities as symbols of revolution and counter-revolution.


WHITHER THE NANKING GOVERNMENT? 
April 4, 1949
Two roads are open to the Nanking Kuomintang government and 
its military and administrative personnel. Either they cling to the 
Chiang Kai-shek clique of war criminals and its master, U.S. imperialism, 
that is, continue to be the enemy of the people and so perish 
together with the Chiang Kai-shek clique of war criminals in the 
People¹s War of Liberation. Or they come over to the people, that 
is, break with the Chiang Kai-shek clique of war criminals and U.S. 
imperialism, perform meritorious service in the People¹s War of Liberation 
to atone for their crimes and so obtain clemency and understanding 
from the people. There is no third road. 
There are three different groups of people in the government of 
Li Tsung-jen and Ho Ying-chin at Nanking.1 One group stubbornly 
persist in following the first road. No matter how plausible they are 
in words, in deeds they are continuing to prepare for war, to betray 
the nation and to oppress and massacre the people who are demanding 
genuine peace. They are Chiang Kai-shek¹s followers even unto 
death. Another group want to follow the second road but have not 
yet been able to take any decisive action. The third group are hesitating 
at the crossroads, and it is uncertain which way they will go. 
They do not want to offend Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. government, 
yet they hope that they will be understood and admitted by the camp 
of people¹s democracy. But this is an illusion and is impossible. 
The Nanking government of Li Tsung-jen and Ho Ying-chin is 
mainly a mixture of people from the first and third groups, with only 
a handful from the second. To this day, this government remains a 
tool of Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. government. 
The massacre which occurred in Nanking on April 12 was no 
accident. It was the inevitable result of the actions taken by the 
government of Li Tsung-jen and Ho Ying-chin to protect Chiang Kai- 
383

384 MAO TSE-TUNG 
shek, his sworn followers and the forces of U.S. aggression. It was 
the result of the absurd trumpeting about ³honourable peace on an 
equal footing² by the government of Li Tsung-jen and Ho Ying-chin 
and by the sworn followers of Chiang Kai-shek, which had the purpose 
of countering the Chinese Communist Party¹s eight terms for 
peace, and particularly the punishment of war criminals. Now that 
the government of Li Tsung-jen and Ho Ying-chin has sent its delegation 
to Peiping to negotiate peace with the Communist Party of China 
and has indicated its willingness to accept the Communist Party¹s 
eight terms as the basis for negotiations, it should, if it has the slightest 
good faith, start by dealing with the Nanking Massacre, arrest and 
severely punish the chief criminals, Chiang Kai-shek, Tang En-po and 
Chang Yao-ming, arrest and severely punish the thugs of the secret 
police in Nanking and Shanghai and arrest and severely punish the 
chief counter-revolutionaries, who are obstinately opposing peace, 
actively disrupting the peace negotiations and actively preparing to 
resist the advance of the People¹s Liberation Army to the south of 
the Yangtse River. ³Until Ching Fu is done away with, the crisis 
in the state of Lu will not be over.²3 Until the war criminals are 
eliminated, there will be no peace in the country. Isn¹t this truth 
clear enough by now? 
We should like to speak plainly to the Nanking government. If 
you are unequal to this job, you should at least help the People¹s 
Liberation Army do it, as our army will soon cross the Yangtse River 
and advance south. At this late hour, you should not indulge in idle 
talk and had better do some real work to atone for your crimes. 
In that case you will not have to flee for your lives, you will not have 
to submit to the bullying of Chiang Kai-shek¹s sworn followers, and 
you will not be spurned for ever by the people. This is your last 
chance. Don¹t lose it. The People¹s Liberation Army will soon 
advance south of the Yangtse River. We are not bluffing. The 
People¹s Liberation Army will advance, whether or not you sign the 
agreement accepting the eight terms. An agreement signed before 
our army advances, will be advantageous to many ‹ to the people, to 
the People¹s Liberation Army, to all those in the Kuomintang government 
who wish to atone for their crimes by performing meritorious 
service, and to the broad ranks of officers and men in the Kuomintang 
army; it will be disadvantageous only to Chiang Kai-shek, his sworn 
followers and the imperialists. If the agreement is not signed, the 
situation will be about the same; solutions can be achieved by local

385 WHITHER NANKING GOVERNMENT? 
negotiations. There may yet be some fighting, but not much. Over 
the vast area and long front extending from Sinkiang to Taiwan, the 
Kuomintang has only about 1,100,000 combat troops left, and so there 
will not be much fighting. Whether a general agreement is signed, or 
whether no such agreement is signed but instead many local agreements 
are signed, it will be all the same for Chiang Kai-shek, for his 
sworn followers and for U.S. imperialism, in a word, for all those 
reactionaries who will not change even unto death; they are irrevocably 
doomed. Perhaps it will be slightly more advantageous to Nanking, 
as well as to ourselves, to sign rather than not to sign a general 
agreement, and that is why we are still striving to conclude it. But 
if a general agreement is to be signed, we must be prepared as a consequence 
to deal with many messy matters. It would be very much 
neater for us not to sign a general agreement but instead to sign many 
local agreements. Nevertheless, we are still ready to sign a general 
agreement. If the Nanking government and its delegation are also 
willing to do so, they must make up their minds in the next few days; 
all illusions and all empty talk should be discarded. We are not 
forcing you to make up your minds. The Nanking government and 
its delegation are free to make up their minds or not to. That is to 
say, you may either listen to Chiang Kai-shek and Leighton Stuart 
and side with them irrevocably, or listen to us and side with us; you 
are free to choose. But there is not much time for you to make your 
choice. The People¹s Liberation Army will soon start its march, and 
there is no opportunity left for hesitation. 
NOTES 
1 After Sun Fo¹s resignation, Li Tsung-jen appointed Ho Ying-chin to succeed 
him as president of the bogus Executive Yuan on March 12, 1949. 
2 On April 1, 1949, over six thousand students from eleven colleges and universities 
in Nanking demonstrated, demanding that the reactionary Kuomintang government 
should accept the eight peace terms of the Chinese Communist Party. On the 
instructions of Chiang Kai-shek, Chang Yao-ming, commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang 
garrison forces at Nanking, ordered soldiers, policemen and secret agents 
to beat the students brutally; two were killed and more than a hundred wounded. 
3 According to Tso Chuan, an ancient Chinese historical work dealing with the 
important events of the Spring and Autumn Era (770-475 B.C.), Ching Fu, a noble 
in the state of Lu, repeatedly stirred up internal strife and murdered two reigning 
princes of that state. The saying in the text was then current among the people of Lu, 
and Ching Fu¹s name has since become a byword for those who stir up internal strife.


ORDER TO THE ARMY 
FOR THE COUNTRY-WIDE ADVANCE* 
April 21, 1949
Comrade commanders and fighters of all field armies, comrades of 
the People¹s Liberation Army in the guerrilla areas of the south! 
The Agreement on Internal Peace, drafted after long negotiations 
between the delegation of the Communist Party of China and the 
delegation of the Nanking Kuomintang government, has been rejected 
by that government.1 The responsible members of the Nanking Kuomintang 
government have rejected the agreement because they are 
still obeying the orders of U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, the 
chieftain of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and because they are trying 
to block the progress of the cause of the Chinese people¹s liberation 
and prevent the internal problem from being solved by peaceful 
means. The Agreement on Internal Peace, comprising eight sections 
with twenty-four articles formulated by the two delegations in the 
negotiations, is lenient on the problem of war criminals, is lenient 
towards the Kuomintang officers, soldiers and government personnel 
and provides appropriate solutions for other problems, all proceeding 
from the interests of the nation and the people. The rejection of this 
agreement shows that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined 
to fight to the finish the counter-revolutionary war which they started. 
The rejection of this agreement shows that in proposing peace negotiations 
on January 1 of this year the Kuomintang reactionaries were 
only trying to check the advance of the People¹s Liberation Army 
and thus gain a breathing space for a later comeback to crush the 
revolutionary forces. The rejection of this agreement shows that 
the Li Tsung-jen government at Nanking was utterly hypocritical in 
professing to accept the Chinese Communist Party¹s eight terms for 
peace as the basis for negotiations. Inasmuch as the Li Tsung-jen 
government had already accepted such fundamental terms as the 
387

388 MAO TSE-TUNG 
punishment of war criminals, the reorganization of all the reactionary 
Kuomintang troops on democratic principles and the handing over of 
all power and authority by the Nanking government and its subordinate 
governments at all levels, it had no reason to reject the 
specific measures which were drawn up on the basis of these fundamental 
terms and which are most lenient. In these circumstances, 
we order you as follows: 
1. Advance bravely and annihilate resolutely, thoroughly, wholly 
and completely all the Kuomintang reactionaries within China¹s 
borders who dare to resist. Liberate the people of the whole 
country. Safeguard China¹s territorial integrity, sovereignty and 
independence. 
2. Advance bravely and arrest all the incorrigible war criminals. 
No matter where they may flee, they must be brought to justice and 
punished according to law. Pay special attention to arresting the 
bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek. 
3. Proclaim to all Kuomintang local governments and local military 
groups the final amended version of the Agreement on Internal 
Peace. In accordance with its general ideas, you may conclude local 
* This order was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung. After the reactionary 
Kuomintang government refused to sign the Agreement on Internal Peace, the People¹s 
Liberation Army acted on this order issued by Chairman Mao Tse-tung and 
Commander-in-Chief Chu Teh and embarked upon a general advance, unprecedented 
in scale, into the vast areas which had not yet been liberated. On the morning of April 
21, 1949, the Second Field Army led by Liu Po-cheng, Teng Hsiao-ping and other 
comrades and the Third Field Army led by Chen Yi, Su Yu, Tan Chen-lin and other 
comrades, forced the Yangtse River on a front extending more than five hundred 
kilometres from Hukou (northeast of Kiukiang) in the west to Kiangyin in the east 
and completely destroyed the defence line along the Yangtse which the enemy had 
painstakingly built in three and a half months. On April 23 these forces liberated 
Nanking, which had been the centre of the counter-revolutionary rule of the Kuomintang 
for twenty-two years, and proclaimed the downfall of the reactionary Kuomintang 
regime. Then they thrust south along separate routes, liberated Hangchow on May 3 
and Nanchang on May 22 and captured Shanghai, China¹s biggest city, on May 27. 
In June they began their march into Fukien Province; they liberated Foochow on 
August 17 and Amoy on October 17. On May 14 the Fourth Field Army led by Lin 
Piao, Lo Jung-huan and other comrades forced the Yangtse on a front of more than 
one hundred kilometres in the Tuanfeng-Wuhsueh sector east of Wuhan. On May 16 
and 17 it liberated Wuchang, Hanyang and Hankow, cities of strategic importance in 
central China. Then it marched south into Hunan. Cheng Chien, Kuomintang 
governor of Hunan Province, and Chen Ming-jen, Commander of the 1st Army, 
renounced their allegiance to the Kuomintang on August 4, and Hunan Province 
was peacefully liberated. The Fourth Field Army fought the Hengyang-Paoching 
campaign in September and October, wiped out the main force of the Kuomintang 
troops under Pai Chung-hsi and then pushed on to Kwangtung and Kwangsi Provinces.

agreements with those who are willing to cease hostilities and to settle 
matters by peaceful means. 
4. After the People¹s Liberation Army has encircled Nanking, 
we are willing to give the Li Tsung-jen government at Nanking 
another opportunity to sign the Agreement on Internal Peace, if that 
government has not yet fled and dispersed and desires to sign it. 
It liberated Canton on October 14, Kweilin on November 22 and Nanning on December 
4. While the Second and Third Field Armies were forcing the Yangtse River, the 
armies in northern China led by Nieh Jung-chen, Hsu Hsiang-chien and other comrades 
captured Taiyuan on April 24, 1949. The First Field Army led by Peng Teh-huai, 
Ho Lung and other comrades, after liberating Sian on May 20, continued its march 
into the Kuomintang areas in the Northwest together with two armies from northern 
China. They captured Lanchow on August 26, liberated - on September 5 and 
Yinchuan on September 23 and completely annihilated the Kuomintang troops under 
Ma Pu-fang and Ma Hung-kuei. Late in September Tao Chih-yueh, Kuomintang 
Garrison Commander-in-Chief of Sinkiang Province, and Burhan, the governor, 
renounced their allegiance to the Kuomintang, and Sinkiang was peacefully liberated. 
At the beginning of November the Second Field Army led by Liu Po-cheng, Teng 
Hsiao-ping and other comrades, together with the 18th Army of the Northern China 
Field Army and part of the First Field Army led by Ho Lung, Li Ching-chuan and 
other comrades, began their march into southwestern China. They liberated Kweiyang 
on November 15 and Chungking on November 30. On December 9 Lu Han, Kuomintang 
governor of Yunnan Province, Liu Wen-hui, Kuomintang governor of 
Sikang Province, and Teng Hsi-hou and Pan Wen-hua, deputy directors of the 
Kuomintang Bureau of Military and Administrative Affairs in the Southwest, 
renounced their allegiance to the Kuomintang, and the two provinces of Yunnan and 
Sikang were peacefully liberated. In late December the People¹s Liberation Army 
which had entered the Southwest fought the Chengtu campaign, completely wiped 
out the Kuomintang troops under Hu Tsung-nan and liberated Chengtu on December 
27. By the end of December 1949 the People¹s Liberation Army had wiped out all 
the Kuomintang troops on China¹s mainland and liberated the entire mainland 
except Tibet.

NOTES 
1 On April 1, 1949, the Kuomintang government delegation headed by Chang 
Chih-chung arrived in Peiping to negotiate peace with the delegation of the Communist 
Party of China. An Agreement on Internal Peace was drafted after a half 
month of negotiations. The agreement (final amended version) was handed to the 
Nanking government delegation by the delegation of the Communist Party of China 
on April 15 and was rejected by the Nanking government on April 20. The full text 
of the agreement (final amended version) is as follows: 
In the 35th year of the Republic of China, the National Government at Nanking, 
with the aid of the Government of the United States of America, defied the 
will of the people, wrecked the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative 
Conference and, on the pretext of opposing the Communist Party of China, launched 
a country-wide civil war against the Chinese people and the Chinese People¹s Liberation 
Army. This war has lasted two years and nine and a half months. It has brought 
untold disaster to the people throughout the country. The country has suffered 
tremendous losses of financial and material resources, and its sovereignty has been 
further infringed. The people of the whole country have always expressed dissatisfaction 
with the National Government at Nanking for its violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s 
revolutionary Three People¹s Principles and of his correct policies of alliance with 
Russia, co-operation with the Communist Party and assistance to the peasants and workers, 
and for its violation of his revolutionary testament. In particular, the whole 
people have voiced their opposition to the launching of the present unprecedented 
large-scale civil war by the National Government at Nanking and to the erroneous 
political, military, financial, economic, cultural and foreign policies and measures which 
that government has adopted in its pursuit of the civil war. The National Government 
at Nanking has completely forfeited the confidence of the entire people. In the present 
civil war its troops have already been defeated by the People¹s Liberation Army led 
by the Communist Party of China and commanded by the Chinese People¹s Revolutionary 
Military Commission. Finding itself in this situation, the National Government 
at Nanking proposed to the Communist Party of China on January 1 of the 
38th year of the Republic of China that negotiations should be held for the cessation 
of the civil war and the restoration of peace. On January 14 of the same year, the 
Communist Party of China issued a statement agreeing to this proposal of the Kuomintang 
government at Nanking and putting forward eight terms as the basis for the 
peace negotiations between the two sides. These terms are as follows: punish the 
war criminals; abolish the bogus constitution; abolish the bogus ³constituted 
authority²; reorganize all reactionary troops on democratic principles; confiscate 
bureaucrat-capital; reform the land system; abrogate treasonable treaties; convene 
a New Political Consultative Conference without the participation of reactionary 
elements and form a democratic coalition government to take over all the power 
and authority of the reactionary Nanking Kuomintang government and of its subordinate 
governments at all levels. These eight basic terms were agreed to by the 
National Government at Nanking. Thereupon, the Communist Party of China and 
the National Government at Nanking appointed their respective delegations, fully 
empowered to conduct negotiations and to sign an agreement. The delegates of 
both parties met in Peiping, have affirmed first of all that the National Government 
at Nanking should bear the full responsibility for the present civil war and for all its 
erroneous policies and have agreed to conclude this agreement.

SECTION ONE 
Article 1. In order to distinguish between right and wrong and to establish 
responsibility, the delegation of the Communist Party of China and the delegation 
of the National Government at Nanking (hereinafter referred to as both sides) 
affirm that, as a matter of principle, punishment shall be meted out to the war 
criminals of the National Government at Nanking who are held responsible for 
launching and prosecuting the present civil war, but that they will be dealt with on 
the merits of each case in accordance with the following conditions: 
Item 1. All war criminals, no matter who they are, may be cleared of the 
charge of being war criminals and treated with leniency, provided they show by 
actual deeds that they are really sincere in distinguishing right from wrong and 
are determined to make a clean break with their past, thus facilitating the 
progress of the cause of the Chinese people¹s liberation and the peaceful 
settlement of the internal problem. 
Item 2. All incorrigible war criminals, no matter who they are, shall be 
severely punished if they obstruct the progress of the cause of the people¹s 
liberation, hinder the peaceful settlement of the internal problem, or go so far 
as to instigate rebellion. The Chinese People¹s Revolutionary Military Commission 
will be responsible for suppressing the ringleaders of rebellion. 
Article 2. Both sides affirm that the National Government at Nanking was 
wrong in pronouncing General Yasuji Okamura, war criminal in the Japanese aggression 
against China, not guilty and releasing him on January 26 of the 38th year of 
the Republic of China and in granting permission on January 31 of the same year for 
the repatriation to Japan of 260 other Japanese war criminals. The cases of all

Government of China, the new central government representing the people throughout 
China, is formed.

committee shall be established at once to take charge of this work of reorganization.

Item 1. The first stage ‹ assembling and regrouping. 
Point 1. All the armed forces under the Nanking National Government 
(ground, naval and air forces, gendarmerie, communications police 
corps, local troops, etc.) shall be assembled and regrouped. The principle 
of regrouping shall be as follows: the reorganization committee shall, on 
the basis of the actual local conditions, order such armed forces in the 
areas entered and taken over by the People¹s Liberation Army to move, 
area by area and stage by stage, to the designated places for assembling 
and regrouping, according to their original designations, formations and 
numerical strength. 
Point 2. Before the People¹s Liberation Army enters and takes over, 
all the armed forces under the Nanking National Government shall be 
held responsible for maintaining local order and preventing any acts of 
sabotage where they are stationed: in all large and small cities, along 
important lines of communication and rivers, at seaports and in the villages. 
Point 3. In the above-mentioned places, when the People¹s Liberation 
Army enters and takes over, the armed forces under the Nanking National 
Government shall, in accordance with the orders of the reorganization 
committee and its sub-committees, hand over peacefully and move to the 
designated places. While moving to the designated places and after arriving 
there, the armed forces under the Nanking National Government shall 
observe strict discipline and shall not disturb local order. 
Point 4. When, in compliance with the orders of the reorganization 
committee and its sub-committees, the armed forces under the Nanking

directions and orders of the People¹s Liberation Army. 
Point 5. The reorganization committee, its sub-committees and the

necessary supplies, such as grain, fodder, bedding and clothing. 
Point 6. The reorganization committee and its sub-committees shall, 
according to the actual conditions in various areas, order the authorities of

the Nanking National Government to hand over, area by area and stage by 
stage, all its military establishments (institutions, schools, factories, storehouses 
and the like, belonging to all its organizations ranging from the Ministry 
of National Defence to the Combined Rear-Service Headquarters), all its 
military installations (naval ports, forts, air bases and the like) and all 
its military supplies to the People¹s Liberation Army and the latter¹s Military 
Control Commissions in various places. 
Item 2. The second stage ‹ reorganization area by area. 
Point 1. After the ground forces under the Nanking National Government 
(infantry, cavalry, special arms, gendarmerie, communications police 
corps and local troops) have moved to the designated places and have been 
assembled and regrouped, area by area and stage by stage, the reorganization 
committee shall, according to the actual conditions in different areas, draw 
up plans for their reorganization area by area and carry out these plans at 
specified times. The principle of reorganization shall be that all the 
above-mentioned ground forces, after being assembled and regrouped, 
shall be reorganized into regular units of the People¹s Liberation Army in 
conformity with its democratic system and regular structure. The reorganization 
committee and its sub-committees shall be responsible for handling 
the cases of those soldiers who have been found eligible for retirement 
because of age or disability and who wish to retire, as well as the cases of 
those officers and non-commissioned officers who wish to retire or take up 
other occupations; the committees shall provide them with facilities to 
return home and with means of livelihood, so that everyone will be properly 
placed and no one will commit misdeeds because he lacks means of support. 
Point 2. After the naval and air forces under the Nanking National 
Government have moved to the designated places and been assembled 
and regrouped, area by area and stage by stage, they shall be reorganized 
according to their original designations, formations and numerical strength 
by the navy and air force reorganization committees, in conformity with the 
democratic system of the People¹s Liberation Army. 
Point 3. All the armed forces under the Nanking National Government, 
after being reorganized into the People¹s Liberation Army, must

Attention of the People¹s Liberation Army and loyally abide by the 
military and political systems of the People¹s Liberation Army, without any 
violation.

must respect the local people¹s governments and obey the laws and decrees 
of the People¹s Government. The people¹s governments and the people 
of various localities shall be considerate of these retired officers and men 
and shall not discriminate against them. 
Article 9. After the signing of the Agreement on Internal Peace, all the armed 
forces under the Nanking National Government must cease conscripting or recruiting 
soldiers or other personnel. They must be responsible for protecting all their arms 
and ammunition, equipment, military institutions and installations and military 
materiel, and must not destroy, conceal, transfer or sell any of them. 
Article 10. After the signing of the Agreement on Internal Peace, the National 
Government at Nanking must, in case any of its armed forces refuses to carry out 
the reorganization plan, assist the People¹s Liberation Army to enforce the reorganization 
plan and ensure its thorough execution.

PROCLAMATION OF 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE¹S LIBERATION ARMY 
April 25, 1949
The Kuomintang reactionaries have rejected the terms for peace 
and persist in their stand of waging a criminal war against the nation 
and the people. The people all over the country hope that the 
People¹s Liberation Army will speedily wipe out the Kuomintang 
reactionaries. We have ordered the People¹s Liberation Army to 
advance courageously, wipe out all reactionary Kuomintang troops 
who dare to resist, arrest all the incorrigible war criminals, liberate 
the people of the whole country, safeguard China¹s territorial integrity, 
sovereignty and independence, and bring about the genuine 
unification of the country, which the whole people long for. We 
earnestly hope that people in all walks of life will assist the People¹s 
Liberation Army wherever it goes. We hereby proclaim the following 
eight-point covenant by which we, together with the whole people, 
shall abide. 
1. Protect the lives and property of all the people. People in all 
walks of life, irrespective of class, belief or occupation, are expected 
to maintain order and adopt a co-operative attitude towards the 
People¹s Liberation Army. The People¹s Liberation Army on its 
part will adopt a co-operative attitude towards people in all walks 
of life. Counter-revolutionaries or other saboteurs who seize the 
opportunity to create disturbances, loot or sabotage shall be severely 
dealt with. 
2. Protect the industrial, commercial, agricultural and livestock 
enterprises of the national bourgeoisie. All privately owned factories, 
shops, banks, warehouses, vessels, wharves, farms, livestock farms 
and other enterprises will without exception be protected against 
any encroachment. It is hoped that workers and employees in all 
397

398 MAO TSE-TUNG 
occupations will maintain production as usual and that all shops will 
remain open as usual. 
3. Confiscate bureaucrat-capital. All factories, shops, banks and 
warehouses, all vessels, wharves and railways, all postal, telegraph, electric 
light, telephone and water supply services, and all farms, livestock 
farms and other enterprises operated by the reactionary Kuomintang 
government and the big bureaucrats shall be taken over by the People¹s 
Government. In such enterprises the private shares held by national 
capitalists engaged in industry, commerce, agriculture or livestock 
raising shall be recognized, after their ownership is verified. All personnel 
working in bureaucrat-capitalist enterprises must remain at 
their posts pending the take-over by the People¹s Government and 
must assume responsibility for the safekeeping of all assets, machinery, 
charts, account books, records, etc., in preparation for the check-up 
and take-over. Those who render useful service in this connection 
will be rewarded; those who obstruct or sabotage will be punished. 
Those desiring to go on working after the take-over by the People¹s 
Government will be given employment commensurate with their abilities 
so that they will not become destitute and homeless. 
4. Protect all public and private schools, hospitals, cultural and 
educational institutions, athletic fields and other public welfare establishments. 
It is hoped that all personnel in these institutions will 
remain at their posts; the People¹s Liberation Army will protect them 
from molestation. 
5. Except for the incorrigible war criminals and counter-revolutionaries 
who have committed the most heinous crimes, the People¹s 
Liberation Army and the People¹s Government will not hold captive, 
arrest or subject to indignity any officials, whether high or low, in the 
Kuomintang¹s central, provincial, municipal and county governments, 
deputies to the ³National Assembly², members of the Legislative and 
Control Yuans, members of the political consultative councils, police 
officers and district, township, village and pao-chia1 officials, so long 
as they do not offer armed resistance or plot sabotage. All these 
persons are enjoined, pending the take-over, to stay at their posts, 
abide by the orders and decrees of the People¹s Liberation Army and 
the People¹s Government and assume responsibility for the safekeeping 
of all the assets and records of their offices. The People¹s Government 
will permit the employment of those among them who can 
make themselves useful in some kind of work and have not committed

399 PROCLAMATION OF PEOPLE¹S LIBERATION ARMY 
any grave reactionary act or other flagrant misdeed. Punishment 
shall be meted out to those who seize the opportunity to engage in 
sabotage, theft or embezzlement, or abscond with public funds, assets 
or records, or refuse to give an accounting. 
6. In order to ensure peace and security in both cities and rural 
areas and to maintain public order, all stragglers and disbanded soldiers 
are required to report and surrender to the People¹s Liberation 
Army or the People¹s Government in their localities. No action will 
be taken against those who voluntarily do so and hand over their 
arms. Those who refuse to report or who conceal their arms shall 
be arrested and investigated. Persons who shelter stragglers and disbanded 
soldiers and do not report them to the authorities shall be 
duly punished. 
7. The feudal system of landownership in the rural areas is irrational 
and should be abolished. To abolish it, however, preparations 
must be made and the necessary steps taken. Generally speaking, the 
reduction of rent and interest should come first and land distribution 
later; only after the People¹s Liberation Army has arrived at a place 
and worked there for a considerable time will it be possible to speak 
of solving the land problem in earnest. The peasant masses should 
organize themselves and help the People¹s Liberation Army to carry 
out the various initial reforms. They should also work hard at their 
farming so as to prevent the present level of agricultural production 
from falling and should then raise it step by step to improve their 
own livelihood and supply the people of the cities with commodity 
grain. Urban land and buildings cannot be dealt with in the same 
way as the problem of rural land. 
8. Protect the lives and property of foreign nationals. It is hoped 
that all foreign nationals will follow their usual pursuits and observe 
order. All foreign nationals must abide by the orders and decrees of 
the People¹s Liberation Army and the People¹s Government and must 
not engage in espionage, act against the cause of China¹s national 
independence and the people¹s liberation, or harbour Chinese war 
criminals, counter-revolutionaries or other law-breakers. Otherwise, 
they shall be dealt with according to law by the People¹s Liberation 
Army and the People¹s Government. 
The People¹s Liberation Army is highly disciplined; it is fair in buying 
and selling and is not allowed to take even a needle or a piece 
of thread from the people. It is hoped that the people throughout

400 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the country will live and work in peace and will not give credence 
to rumours or raise false alarms. This proclamation is hereby issued 
in all sincerity and earnestness.

and Anhwei. The ³Regulations² provided that ³the pao and chia are to be organized 
on the basis of households; there is to be a head of each household, of each chia, 
which is made up of ten households, and of each pao, which is made up of ten chia². 
Neighbours were required to watch and report each other¹s activities to the authorities, 
and all were punishable when one was found guilty: various counter-revolutionary 
measures for exacting compulsory labour were also laid down. On November 7, 
1934, the Kuomintang government officially announced that this system of fascist rule 
was to be established in all the provinces and municipalities under its rule.

ON THE OUTRAGES BY BRITISH WARSHIPS1 
‹ STATEMENT BY THE SPOKESMAN 
OF THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS OF 
THE CHINESE PEOPLE¹S LIBERATION ARMY* 
April 30, 1949
We denounce the preposterous statement of the warmonger 
Churchill.2 In the British House of Commons on April 26, Churchill 
demanded that the British government should send two aircraft 
carriers to the Far East for ³effective power of retaliation². What 
are you ³retaliating² for, Mr. Churchill? British warships together 
with Kuomintang warships intruded into the defence area of the 
Chinese People¹s Liberation Army and fired on the People¹s Liberation 
Army, causing no less than 252 casualties among our loyal 
and gallant fighters. Since the British have trespassed on Chinese 
territory and committed so great a crime, the People¹s Liberation Army 
has good reason to demand that the British government admit its 
wrongdoing, apologize and make compensation. Isn¹t this what you 
should do, instead of dispatching forces to China to ³retaliate² against 
the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army? Prime Minister Attlee¹s 
statement is also wrong.3 Britain, he said, has the right to send her 
warships into China¹s Yangtse River. The Yangtse is an inland 
waterway of China. What right have you British to send in your 
warships? You have no such right. The Chinese people will defend 
their territory and sovereignty and absolutely will not permit encroachment 
by foreign governments. Attlee said that the People¹s Liberation 
Army ³would be prepared to allow the ship [the Amethyst] to proceed 
to Nanking but only on condition that she should assist the People¹s 
Liberation Army to cross the Yangtse². Attlee lied. The People¹s 
Liberation Army gave no permission to the Amethyst to proceed to 
Nanking. The People¹s Liberation Army does not want the armed 
forces of any foreign country to help it cross the Yangtse or to 
401

402 MAO TSE-TUNG 
do anything else. On the contrary, the People¹s Liberation Army 
demands that Britain, the United States and France quickly withdraw 
their armed forces ‹ their warships, military aircraft and marines 
stationed in the Yangtse and Whangpoo Rivers and other parts of 
China ‹ from China¹s territorial inland waters, seas, land and air and 
that they refrain from helping the enemy of the Chinese people to 
wage civil war. The Chinese People¹s Revolutionary Military Commission 
and the People¹s Government have so far not established 
diplomatic relations with any foreign government. The Chinese 
People¹s Revolutionary Military Commission and the People¹s Government 
will protect those foreign nationals in China who are engaged 
in legitimate pursuits. They are willing to consider the establishment 
of diplomatic relations with foreign countries; such relations must be 
based on equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty 
and territorial integrity and, first of all, on no help being given to the 
Kuomintang reactionaries. They will tolerate no act of intimidation 
by any foreign government. A foreign government which wishes to 
consider establishing diplomatic relations with us must sever relations 
with the remnant Kuomintang forces and withdraw its armed forces 
from China. Attlee complained that the Communist Party of China, 
having no diplomatic relations with foreign countries, was unwilling 
to have contacts with the old diplomatic personnel of foreign governments 
(consuls recognized by the Kuomintang). Such complaints are 
groundless. In the past few years, the governments of the United 
States, Britain, Canada, etc. have helped the Kuomintang to oppose 
us. Can Mr. Attlee have forgotten this? Can it also be that 
Mr. Attlee does not know which country gave the Kuomintang the 
Chungking,4 the heavy cruiser which was recently sunk? 
* This statement was drafted by Comrade Mao Tse-tung for the spokesman of 
the General Headquarters of the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army. It expressed 
the solemn stand of the Chinese people who fear no threats and resolutely oppose 
imperialist aggression; it also set forth the foreign policy of the new China which 
was soon to be established.

403 ON OUTRAGES BY BRITISH WARSHIP 
NOTES 
1 On April 20-21, 1949, while the People¹s Liberation Army was fighting its way 
across the Yangtse, the Amethyst and three other British warships intruded into the 
river, an inland waterway of China, and, together with Kuomintang warships, fired 
on our army, causing 252 casualties. The People¹s Liberation Army returned the 
fire; the Amethyst was disabled and forced to anchor near Chinkiang; the other three 
British warships escaped. The British authorities requested that the Amethyst should 
be allowed to leave, and its captain, acting on the orders of Brind, Commander-in- 
Chief of the British Far Eastern Fleet, conducted negotiations with the representative 
of our army. During these negotiations, the British side consistently prevaricated 
and refused to admit its criminal acts of aggression. While the negotiations were 
continuing, on the night of July 30, the Amethyst forced her way alongside a passenger 
ship, the Liberated Chiangling, which was going downstream off Chinkiang, and 
escaped by using that ship as a shield. When our army signalled a warning to the 
Amethyst to stop, she opened fire, collided with and sank a number of junks and 
escaped from the Yangtse River. 
2 On April 26, 1949, speaking in the British House of Commons, Churchill, the 
chieftain of the British Conservative Party, slandered as an ³atrocious outrage² the 
action taken by the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army in counter-attacking the British 
warships which had fired on our army, and demanded that the British government 
³get in Chinese waters one aircraft carrier, if not two, capable of . . . effective power 
of retaliation². 
3 On April 26, 1949, British Prime Minister Attlee declared in the House of 
Commons that British naval vessels had been within their rights in going up the 
Yangtse on their ³peaceful missions², because they had the permission of the 
Kuomintang government of China. At the same time, when speaking about the 
negotiations which the British representative was holding with the representative of 
the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army, Attlee lied, saying that the Chinese People¹s 
Liberation Army ³would be prepared to allow the ship [the Amethyst] to proceed to 
Nanking but only on condition that she should assist the People¹s Liberation Army 
to cross the Yangtse². 
4 It was the British government which in February 1943 gave the Kuomintang 
the heavy cruiser Chungking, the largest cruiser in the Kuomintang navy. On 
February 25, 1949, the officers and men of the cruiser revolted, renounced their 
allegiance to the reactionary Kuomintang government and joined the Chinese People¹s 
Navy. On March 19 the U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits sent heavy 
bombers and sank the Chungking off Hulutao, in Liaotung Gulf in northeastern China.


ADDRESS TO THE PREPARATORY MEETING 
OF THE NEW POLITICAL 
CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE 
June 15, 1949
Fellow Delegates, 
Today we are holding the inaugural session of the Preparatory 
Meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference.1 The task of 
this meeting is to complete all necessary preparations and speedily convene 
the New Political Consultative Conference, which will form a 
democratic coalition government in order to lead the people of the 
whole country in eliminating the remnant forces of Kuomintang reaction 
and unifying all China as swiftly as possible, and in carrying 
out, systematically and step by step, country-wide construction in the 
political, economic and cultural fields and in national defence. This 
is what the people of the whole country expect us to do, and we must 
do it. 
The convening of the New Political Consultative Conference was 
proposed to the people of the whole country by the Communist Party 
of China on May 1, 1948.2 The proposal obtained a quick response 
from the democratic parties, people¹s organizations, democratic personages 
in all walks of life throughout China, the country¹s minority 
nationalities and the overseas Chinese. The Communist Party of 
China, the democratic parties, people¹s organizations, democratic personages 
in all walks of life, minority nationalities and overseas Chinese 
all hold that we must overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, 
bureaucrat-capitalism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, convene a 
Political Consultative Conference of representatives of all the democratic 
parties, people¹s organizations, democratic personages in all 
walks of life, minority nationalities and overseas Chinese, proclaim 
the founding of the People¹s Republic of China and elect a democratic 
coalition government to represent it. Only thus can our great 
405

406 MAO TSE-TUNG 
motherland free herself from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal fate and 
take the road of independence, freedom, peace, unity, strength and 
prosperity. This is a common political basis. It is the common 
political basis for the united struggle of the Communist Party of 
China, the democratic parties, people¹s organizations, democratic personages 
in all walks of life, minority nationalities and overseas Chinese; 
it is also the common political basis for the united struggle of the 
whole people. So firm is this political basis that no serious-minded 
democratic party, people¹s organization or democratic personage has 
expressed any differences of opinion, and all hold that this is the only 
road which leads in the right direction for solving all China¹s problems. 
The people of the whole country supporting their own People¹s 
Liberation Army have won the war. This great People¹s War of 
Liberation, begun in July 1946, has now lasted three years. The 
war was launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries with the help 
they received from foreign imperialism. In unleashing this civil war 
against the people the Kuomintang reactionaries perfidiously and 
unscrupulously tore up the truce agreement and the resolutions of 
the Political Consultative Conference of January 1946. But in three 
short years they have been defeated by the heroic People¹s Liberation 
Army. Not long ago, after the Kuomintang reactionaries¹ peace plot 
was exposed, the People¹s Liberation Army bravely advanced and 
crossed the Yangtse River. Nanking, the capital of the Kuomintang 
reactionaries, is now in our hands. Shanghai, Hangchow, Nanchang, 
Wuhan and Sian have been liberated. At this very moment, the 
field armies of the People¹s Liberation Army are conducting a great 
march unprecedented in Chinese history into the southern and northwestern 
provinces. In three years the People¹s Liberation Army has 
wiped out a total of 5,590,000 of the reactionary Kuomintang troops. 
Now the remnants of the Kuomintang forces number only about 
1,500,000, including regulars, irregulars and those in the military 
establishments and academies in the rear. It will still take some time 
to mop up these enemy remnants, but not long. 
This is a victory for the people of all China, and also a victory 
for the peoples of the whole world. The whole world, except the 
imperialists and the reactionaries in various countries, is elated and 
inspired by this great victory of the Chinese people. The struggle 
of the Chinese people against their own enemies and the struggles 
of the peoples of the world against their own enemies have the 
same meaning. The people of China and the peoples of the world

407 ADDRESS TO NEW POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE 
have all witnessed the fact that the imperialists have directed the 
Chinese reactionaries ruthlessly to oppose the Chinese people by 
means of a counter-revolutionary war and that the Chinese people 
have triumphantly overthrown the reactionaries by means of a 
revolutionary war. 
Here, I think it is necessary to call people¹s attention to the fact 
that the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, 
will not resign themselves to defeat in this land of China. They will 
continue to gang up against the Chinese people in every possible way. 
For example, they will smuggle their agents into China to sow dissension 
and make trouble. That is certain; they will never neglect these 
activities. To take another example, they will incite the Chinese reactionaries, 
and even throw in their own forces, to blockade China¹s 
ports. They will do this as long as it is possible. Furthermore, if 
they still hanker after adventures, they will send some of their troops 
to invade and harass China¹s frontiers; this, too, is not impossible. 
All this we must take fully into account. Just because we have won 
victory, we must never relax our vigilance against the frenzied plots 
for revenge by the imperialists and their running dogs. Whoever 
relaxes vigilance will disarm himself politically and land himself in 
a passive position. In view of these circumstances, the people all over 
the country must unite to smash resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and 
completely every plot against the Chinese people by the imperialists 
and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries. China must be 
independent, China must be liberated, China¹s affairs must be decided 
and run by the Chinese people themselves, and no further interference, 
not even the slightest, will be tolerated from any imperialist country. 
The Chinese revolution is a revolution of the broad masses of the 
whole nation. Everybody is our friend, except the imperialists, the 
feudalists and the bureaucrat-capitalists, the Kuomintang reactionaries 
and their accomplices. We have a broad and solid revolutionary 
united front. This united front is so broad that it includes the working 
class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national 
bourgeoisie. This united front is so solid that it possesses the resolute 
will and the inexhaustible capacity to defeat every enemy and overcome 
every difficulty. The epoch we are living in is an epoch in which the 
imperialist system is heading for total collapse, the imperialists have 
fallen inextricably into crisis and, no matter how they continue to 
oppose the Chinese people, the Chinese people will always have a 
way to win final victory.

408 MAO TSE-TUNG 
At the same time, we proclaim to the whole world that what we 
oppose is exclusively the imperialist system and its plots against the 
Chinese people. We are willing to discuss with any foreign government 
the establishment of diplomatic relations on the basis of the principles 
of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territorial integrity 
and sovereignty, provided it is willing to sever relations with the Chinese 
reactionaries, stops conspiring with them or helping them and 
adopts an attitude of genuine, and not hypocritical, friendship towards 
People¹s China. The Chinese people wish to have friendly co-operation 
with the people of all countries and to resume and expand international 
trade in order to develop production and promote economic prosperity. 
Fellow Delegates, all the conditions are ripe for us to convene the 
New Political Consultative Conference and to form a democratic coalition 
government. The people throughout the country are most eagerly 
expecting us to convene the conference and form the government. I 
believe the work we have now begun will fulfil this hope, and do so 
before long. 
Upon the formation of China¹s democratic coalition government, 
its central tasks will be: (1) to mop up the remnants of the reactionaries 
and suppress their trouble-making; and (2) to do everything 
possible and make the utmost effort to restore and develop the people¹s 
economy and, at the same time, to restore and develop the people¹s 
culture and education. 
The Chinese people will see that, once China¹s destiny is in the 
hands of the people, China, like the sun rising in the east, will illuminate 
every corner of the land with a brilliant flame, swiftly clean 
up the mire left by the reactionary government, heal the wounds of 
war and build a new, powerful and prosperous people¹s republic worthy 
of the name. 
Long live the People¹s Republic of China! 
Long live the democratic coalition government! 
Long live the great unity of the people of the whole country!

Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference² and the ³Provisions Regarding 
the Organizations and Groups Participating in the New Political Consultative 
Conference and the Size of Their Delegations² and elected a Standing Committee 
headed by Chairman Mao Tse-tung. The Conference was called the New Political 
Consultative Conference to distinguish it from the Political Consultative Conference

ON THE PEOPLE¹S DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP 
In Commemoration of the Twenty-eighth Anniversary 
of the Communist Party of China 
June 30, 1949
The first of July 1949 marks the fact that the Communist Party of 
China has already lived through twenty-eight years. Like a man, a 
political party has its childhood, youth, manhood and old age. The 
Communist Party of China is no longer a child or a lad in his teens 
but has become an adult. When a man reaches old age, he will die; 
the same is true of a party. When classes disappear, all instruments 
of class struggle ‹ parties and the state machinery ‹ will lose their 
function, cease to be necessary, therefore gradually wither away and 
end their historical mission; and human society will move to a higher 
stage. We are the opposite of the political parties of the bourgeoisie. 
They are afraid to speak of the extinction of classes, state power and 
parties. We, on the contrary, declare openly that we are striving 
hard to create the very conditions which will bring about their extinction. 
The leadership of the Communist Party and the state power 
of the people¹s dictatorship are such conditions. Anyone who does 
not recognize this truth is no communist. Young comrades who have 
not studied Marxism-Leninism and have only recently joined the Party 
may not yet understand this truth. They must understand it ‹ only 
then can they have a correct world outlook. They must understand 
that the road to the abolition of classes, to the abolition of state power 
and to the abolition of parties is the road all mankind must take; it 
is only a question of time and conditions. Communists the world 
over are wiser than the bourgeoisie, they understand the laws governing 
the existence and development of things, they understand dialectics 
and they can see farther. The bourgeoisie does not welcome this 
411

FROM MARX 
TO MAO 
 
NOT FOR

DISTRIBUTION 
412 
truth because it does not want to be overthrown. To be overthrown 
is painful and is unbearable to contemplate for those overthrown, for 
example, for the Kuomintang reactionaries whom we are now overthrowing 
and for Japanese imperialism which we together with other 
peoples overthrew some time ago. But for the working class, the 
labouring people and the Communist Party the question is not one of 
being overthrown, but of working hard to create the conditions in which 
classes, state power and political parties will die out very naturally 
and mankind will enter the realm of Great Harmony.1 We have 
mentioned in passing the long-range perspective of human progress in 
order to explain clearly the problems we are about to discuss. 
As everyone knows, our Party passed through these twenty-eight 
years not in peace but amid hardships, for we had to fight enemies, 
both foreign and domestic, both inside and outside the Party. We 
thank Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin for giving us a weapon. This 
weapon is not a machine-gun, but Marxism-Leninism. 
In his book ³Left-Wing² Communism, an Infantile Disorder written 
in 1920, Lenin described the quest of the Russians for revolutionary 
theory.2 Only after several decades of hardship and suffering did 
the Russians find Marxism. Many things in China were the same as, 
or similar to, those in Russia before the October Revolution. There 
was the same feudal oppression. There was similar economic and 
cultural backwardness. Both countries were backward, China even 
more so. In both countries alike, for the sake of national regeneration 
progressives braved hard and bitter struggles in their quest for 
revolutionary truth. 
From the time of China¹s defeat in the Opium War of 1840,3 
Chinese progressives went through untold hardships in their quest for 
truth from the Western countries. Hung Hsiu-chuan,4 Kang Yu-wei,5 
Yen Fu6 and Sun Yat-sen were representative of those who had looked 
to the West for truth before the Communist Party of China was born. 
Chinese who then sought progress would read any book containing 
the new knowledge from the West. The number of students sent 
to Japan, Britain, the United States, France and Germany was 
amazing. At home, the imperial examinations7 were abolished and 
modern schools sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain; 
every effort was made to learn from the West. In my youth, I too 
engaged in such studies. They represented the culture of Western 
bourgeois democracy, including the social theories and natural sciences 
of that period, and they were called ³the new learning² in contrast to

413 ON THE PEOPLE¹S DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP 
Chinese feudal culture, which was called ³the old learning². For 
quite a long time, those who had acquired the new learning felt confident 
that it would save China, and very few of them had any doubts 
on this score, as the adherents of the old learning had. Only modernization 
could save China, only learning from foreign countries could 
modernize China. Among the foreign countries, only the Western 
capitalist countries were then progressive, as they had successfully 
built modern bourgeois states. The Japanese had been successful in 
learning from the West, and the Chinese also wished to learn from 
the Japanese. The Chinese in those days regarded Russia as backward, 
and few wanted to learn from her. That was how the Chinese 
tried to learn from foreign countries in the period from the 1840s to 
the beginning of the 20th century. 
Imperialist aggression shattered the fond dreams of the Chinese 
about learning from the West. It was very odd ‹ why were the 
teachers always committing aggression against their pupil? The Chinese 
learned a good deal from the West, but they could not make it 
work and were never able to realize their ideals. Their repeated 
struggles, including such a country-wide movement as the Revolution 
of 1911,8 all ended in failure. Day by day, conditions in the country 
got worse, and life was made impossible. Doubts arose, increased 
and deepened. World War I shook the whole globe. The Russians 
made the October Revolution and created the world¹s first socialist 
state. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the revolutionary 
energy of the great proletariat and labouring people of Russia, hitherto 
latent and unseen by foreigners, suddenly erupted like a volcano, and 
the Chinese and all mankind began to see the Russians in a new 
light. Then, and only then, did the Chinese enter an entirely new era 
in their thinking and their life. They found Marxism-Leninism, the 
universally applicable truth, and the face of China began to change. 
It was through the Russians that the Chinese found Marxism. 
Before the October Revolution, the Chinese were not only ignorant of 
Lenin and Stalin, they did not even know of Marx and Engels. The 
salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The 
October Revolution helped progressives in China, as throughout the 
world, to adopt the proletarian world outlook as the instrument for 
studying a nation¹s destiny and considering anew their own problems. 
Follow the path of the Russians ‹ that was their conclusion. In 1919, 
the May 4th Movement took place in China. In 1921, the Communist 
Party of China was founded. Sun Yat-sen, in the depths of despair,

414 MAO TSE-TUNG 
came across the October Revolution and the Communist Party of China. 
He welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed Russian help to the 
Chinese and welcomed co-operation of the Communist Party of 
China. Then Sun Yat-sen died and Chiang Kai-shek rose to power. 
Over a long period of twenty-two years, Chiang Kai-shek dragged 
China into ever more hopeless straits. In this period, during the antifascist 
Second World War in which the Soviet Union was the main 
force, three big imperialist powers were knocked out, while two others 
were weakened. In the whole world only one big imperialist power, the 
United States of America, remained uninjured. But the United States 
faced a grave domestic crisis. It wanted to enslave the whole world; 
it supplied arms to help Chiang Kai-shek slaughter several million 
Chinese. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the 
Chinese people, after driving out Japanese imperialism, waged the People¹s 
War of Liberation for three years and have basically won victory. 
Thus Western bourgeois civilization, bourgeois democracy and the 
plan for a bourgeois republic have all gone bankrupt in the eyes of 
the Chinese people. Bourgeois democracy has given way to people¹s 
democracy under the leadership of the working class and the bourgeois 
republic to the people¹s republic. This has made it possible to achieve 
socialism and communism through the people¹s republic, to abolish 
classes and enter a world of Great Harmony. Kang Yu-wei wrote 
Ta Tung Shu, or the Book of Great Harmony, but he did not and could 
not find the way to achieve Great Harmony. There are bourgeois 
republics in foreign lands, but China cannot have a bourgeois republic 
because she is a country suffering under imperialist oppression. The 
only way is through a people¹s republic led by the working class. 
All other ways have been tried and failed. Of the people who 
hankered after those ways, some have fallen, some have awakened and 
some are changing their ideas. Events are developing so swiftly that 
many feel the abruptness of the change and the need to learn anew. 
This state of mind is understandable and we welcome this worthy 
desire to learn anew. 
The vanguard of the Chinese proletariat learned Marxism-Leninism 
after the October Revolution and founded the Communist Party of 
China. It entered at once into political struggles and only now, after 
a tortuous course of twenty-eight years, has it won basic victory. From 
our twenty-eight years¹ experience we have drawn a conclusion similar 
to the one Sun Yat-sen drew in his testament from his ³experience of 
forty years²; that is, we are deeply convinced that to win victory, ³we

415 ON THE PEOPLE¹S DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP 
must arouse the masses of the people and unite in a common struggle 
with those nations of the world which treat us as equals². Sun Yatsen 
had a world outlook different from ours and started from a 
different class standpoint in studying and tackling problems; yet, in 
the 1920s he reached a conclusion basically the same as ours on the 
question of how to struggle against imperialism. 
Twenty-four years have passed since Sun Yat-sen¹s death, and the 
Chinese revolution, led by the Communist Party of China, has made 
tremendous advances both in theory and practice and has radically 
changed the face of China. Up to now the principal and fundamental 
experience the Chinese people have gained is twofold: 
(1) Internally, arouse the masses of the people. That is, 
unite the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie 
and the national bourgeoisie, form a domestic united front under 
the leadership of the working class, and advance from this to the 
establishment of a state which is a people¹s democratic dictatorship 
under the leadership of the working class and based on the 
alliance of workers and peasants. 
(2) Externally, unite in a common struggle with those nations 
of the world which treat us as equals and unite with the peoples 
of all countries. That is, ally ourselves with the Soviet Union, 
with the People¹s Democracies and with the proletariat and the 
broad masses of the people in all other countries, and form an 
international united front. 
³You are leaning to one side.² Exactly. The forty years¹ experience 
of Sun Yat-sen and the twenty-eight years¹ experience of the 
Communist Party have taught us to lean to one side, and we are 
firmly convinced that in order to win victory and consolidate it we 
must lean to one side. In the light of the experiences accumulated 
in these forty years and these twenty-eight years, all Chinese without 
exception must lean either to the side of imperialism or to the side of 
socialism. Sitting on the fence will not do, nor is there a third road. 
We oppose the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries who lean to the side of 
imperialism, and we also oppose the illusions about a third road. 
³You are too irritating.² We are talking about how to deal with 
domestic and foreign reactionaries, the imperialists and their running 
dogs, not about how to deal with anyone else. With regard to such 
reactionaries, the question of irritating them or not does not arise. 
Irritated or not irritated, they will remain the same because they are

416 MAO TSE-TUNG 
reactionaries. Only if we draw a clear line between reactionaries and 
revolutionaries, expose the intrigues and plots of the reactionaries, 
arouse the vigilance and attention of the revolutionary ranks, heighten 
our will to fight and crush the enemy¹s arrogance can we isolate the 
reactionaries, vanquish them or supersede them. We must not show 
the slightest timidity before a wild beast. We must learn from Wu 
Sung9 on the Chingyang Ridge. As Wu Sung saw it, the tiger on 
Chingyang Ridge was a man-eater, whether irritated or not. Either 
kill the tiger or be eaten by him ‹ one or the other. 
³We want to do business.² Quite right, business will be done. 
We are against no one except the domestic and foreign reactionaries 
who hinder us from doing business. Everybody should know that it 
is none other than the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chiang 
Kai-shek reactionaries, who hinder us from doing business and also 
from establishing diplomatic relations with foreign countries. When 
we have beaten the internal and external reactionaries by uniting all 
domestic and international forces, we shall be able to do business 
and establish diplomatic relations with all foreign countries on the 
basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territorial 
integrity and sovereignty. 
³Victory is possible even without international help.² This is a 
mistaken idea. In the epoch in which imperialism exists, it is impossible 
for a genuine people¹s revolution to win victory in any country 
without various forms of help from the international revolutionary 
forces, and even if victory were won, it could not be consolidated. 
This was the case with the victory and consolidation of the great 
October Revolution, as Lenin and Stalin told us long ago. This was 
also the case with the overthrow of the three imperialist powers in 
World War II and the establishment of the People¹s Democracies. 
And this is also the case with the present and the future of People¹s 
China. Just imagine! If the Soviet Union had not existed, if there 
had been no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese 
imperialism had not been defeated, if the People¹s Democracies had 
not come into being, if the oppressed nations of the East were not 
rising in struggle and if there were no struggle of the masses of the 
people against their reactionary rulers in the United States, Britain, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and other capitalist countries ‹ if not 
for all these in combination, the international reactionary forces bearing 
down upon us would certainly be many times greater than now. 
In such circumstances, could we have won victory? Obviously not.

417 ON THE PEOPLE¹S DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP 
And even with victory, there could be no consolidation. The Chinese 
people have had more than enough experience of this kind. This 
experience was reflected long ago in Sun Yat-sen¹s death-bed statement 
on the necessity of uniting with the international revolutionary 
forces. 
³We need help from the British and U.S. governments.² This, 
too, is a naive idea in these times. Would the present rulers of Britain 
and the United States, who are imperialists, help a people¹s state? 
Why do these countries do business with us and, supposing they might 
be willing to lend us money on terms of mutual benefit in the future, 
why would they do so? Because their capitalists want to make money 
and their bankers want to earn interest to extricate themselves from 
their own crisis ‹ it is not a matter of helping the Chinese people. 
The Communist Parties and progressive groups in these countries are 
urging their governments to establish trade and even diplomatic relations 
with us. This is goodwill, this is help, this cannot be mentioned 
in the same breath with the conduct of the bourgeoisie in the same 
countries. Throughout his life, Sun Yat-sen appealed countless times 
to the capitalist countries for help and got nothing but heartless rebuffs. 
Only once in his whole life did Sun Yat-sen receive foreign help, and 
that was Soviet help. Let readers refer to Dr. Sun Yat-sen¹s testament; 
his earnest advice was not to look for help from the imperialist 
countries but to ³unite with those nations of the world which treat 
us as equals². Dr. Sun had experience; he had suffered, he had been 
deceived. We should remember his words and not allow ourselves 
to be deceived again. Internationally, we belong to the side of the 
anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union, and so we can turn 
only to this side for genuine and friendly help, not to the side of the 
imperialist front. 
³You are dictatorial.² My dear sirs, you are right, that is just 
what we are. All the experience the Chinese people have accumulated 
through several decades teaches us to enforce the people¹s democratic 
dictatorship, that is, to deprive the reactionaries of the right to speak 
and let the people alone have that right. 
Who are the people? At the present stage in China, they are the 
working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the 
national bourgeoisie. These classes, led by the working class and the 
Communist Party, unite to form their own state and elect their own 
government; they enforce their dictatorship over the running dogs of 
imperialism ‹ the landlord class and bureaucrat-bourgeoisie, as well as

418 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the representatives of those classes, the Kuomintang reactionaries and 
their accomplices ‹ suppress them, allow them only to behave themselves 
and not to be unruly in word or deed. If they speak or act in 
an unruly way, they will be promptly stopped and punished. Democracy 
is practised within the ranks of the people, who enjoy the rights 
of freedom of speech, assembly, association and so on. The right to 
vote belongs only to the people, not to the reactionaries. The combination 
of these two aspects, democracy for the people and dictatorship 
over the reactionaries, is the people¹s democratic dictatorship. 
Why must things be done this way? The reason is quite clear to 
everybody. If things were not done this way, the revolution would 
fail, the people would suffer, the country would be conquered. 
³Don¹t you want to abolish state power?² Yes, we do, but not 
right now; we cannot do it yet. Why? Because imperialism still 
exists, because domestic reaction still exists, because classes still exist 
in our country. Our present task is to strengthen the people¹s state 
apparatus-mainly the people¹s army, the people¹s police and the 
people¹s courts ‹ in order to consolidate national defence and protect 
the people¹s interests. Given this condition, China can develop 
steadily, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist 
Party, from an agricultural into an industrial country and from a 
new-democratic into a socialist and communist society, can abolish 
classes and realize the Great Harmony. The state apparatus, including 
the army, the police and the courts, is the instrument by which 
one class oppresses another. It is an instrument for the oppression 
of antagonistic classes; it is violence and not ³benevolence². ³You 
are not benevolent!² Quite so. We definitely do not apply a policy 
of benevolence to the reactionaries and towards the reactionary activities 
of the reactionary classes. Our policy of benevolence is applied 
only within the ranks of the people, not beyond them to the reactionaries 
or to the reactionary activities of reactionary classes. 
The people¹s state protects the people. Only when the people 
have such a state can they educate and remould themselves by 
democratic methods on a country-wide scale, with everyone taking 
part, and shake off the influence of domestic and foreign reactionaries 
(which is still very strong, will survive for a long time and cannot be 
quickly destroyed), rid themselves of the bad habits and ideas acquired 
in the old society, not allow themselves to be led astray by the reactionaries, 
and continue to advance ‹ to advance towards a socialist 
and communist society.

419 ON THE PEOPLE¹S DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP 
Here, the method we employ is democratic, the method of persuasion, 
not of compulsion. When anyone among the people breaks the 
law, he too should be punished, imprisoned or even sentenced to death; 
but this is a matter of a few individual cases, and it differs in principle 
from the dictatorship exercised over the reactionaries as a class. 
As for the members of the reactionary classes and individual reactionaries, 
so long as they do not rebel, sabotage or create trouble after 
their political power has been overthrown, land and work will be 
given to them as well in order to allow them to live and remould 
themselves through labour into new people. If they are not willing 
to work, the people¹s state will compel them to work. Propaganda 
and educational work will be done among them too and will be done, 
moreover, with as much care and thoroughness as among the captured 
army officers in the past. This, too, may be called a ³policy of benevolence² 
if you like, but it is imposed by us on the members of the 
enemy classes and cannot be mentioned in the same breath with the 
work of self-education which we carry on within the ranks of the 
revolutionary people. 
Such remoulding of members of the reactionary classes can be 
accomplished only by a state of the people¹s democratic dictatorship 
under the leadership of the Communist Party. When it is well done, 
China¹s major exploiting classes, the landlord class and the bureaucratbourgeoisie 
(the monopoly capitalist class), will be eliminated for good. 
There remain the national bourgeoisie; at the present stage, we can 
already do a good deal of suitable educational work with many of 
them. When the time comes to realize socialism, that is, to nationalize 
private enterprise, we shall carry the work of educating and remoulding 
them a step further. The people have a powerful state apparatus 
in their hands ‹ there is no need to fear rebellion by the national 
bourgeoisie. 
The serious problem is the education of the peasantry. The peasant 
economy is scattered, and the socialization of agriculture, judging 
by the Soviet Union¹s experience, will require a long time and painstaking 
work. Without socialization of agriculture, there can be no 
complete, consolidated socialism. The steps to socialize agriculture 
must be co-ordinated with the development of a powerful industry 
having state enterprise as its backbone.10 The state of the people¹s 
democratic dictatorship must systematically solve the problems of 
industrialization. Since it is not proposed to discuss economic problems 
in detail in this article, I shall not go into them further.

420 MAO TSE-TUNG 
In 1924 a famous manifesto was adopted at the Kuomintang¹s 
First National Congress, which Sun Yat-sen himself led and in which 
Communists participated. The manifesto stated: 
The so-called democratic system in modern states is usually 
monopolized by the bourgeoisie and has become simply an instrument 
for oppressing the common people. On the other hand, the 
Kuomintang¹s Principle of Democracy means a democratic system 
shared by all the common people and not privately owned by 
the few. 
Apart from the question of who leads whom, the Principle of Democracy 
stated above corresponds as a general political programme to 
what we call People¹s Democracy or New Democracy. A state system 
which is shared only by the common people and which the bourgeoisie 
is not allowed to own privately ‹ add to this the leadership of the 
working class, and we have the state system of the people¹s democratic 
dictatorship. 
Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Sun Yat-sen and used the dictatorship 
of the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie and the landlord class as an instrument 
for oppressing the common people of China. This counter-revolutionary 
dictatorship was enforced for twenty-two years and has only now been 
overthrown by the common people of China under our leadership. 
The foreign reactionaries who accuse us of practising ³dictatorship² 
or ³totalitarianism² are the very persons who practise it. They practise 
the dictatorship or totalitarianism of one class, the bourgeoisie, 
over the proletariat and the rest of the people. They are the very 
persons Sun Yat-sen spoke of as the bourgeoisie of modern states 
who oppress the common people. And it is from these reactionary 
scoundrels that Chiang Kai-shek learned his counter-revolutionary 
dictatorship. 
Chu Hsi, a philosopher of the Sung Dynasty, wrote many books 
and made many remarks which are now forgotten, but one remark 
is still remembered, ³Deal with a man as he deals with you.²11 This 
is just what we do; we deal with the imperialists and their running 
dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, as they deal with us. That 
is all there is to it! 
Revolutionary dictatorship and counter-revolutionary dictatorship 
are by nature opposites, but the former was learned from the latter. 
Such learning is very important. If the revolutionary people do not 
master this method of ruling over the counter-revolutionary classes,

421 ON THE PEOPLE¹S DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP 
they will not be able to maintain their state power, domestic and 
foreign reaction will overthrow that power and restore its own rule 
over China, and disaster will befall the revolutionary people. 
The people¹s democratic dictatorship is based on the alliance of 
the working class, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie, and 
mainly on the alliance of the workers and the peasants, because these 
two classes comprise 80 t o 90 per cent of China¹s population. These 
two classes are the main force in overthrowing imperialism and the 
Kuomintang reactionaries. The transition from New Democracy to 
socialism also depends mainly upon their alliance. 
The people¹s democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the 
working class. For it is only the working class that is most farsighted, 
most selfless and most thoroughly revolutionary. The entire 
history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working 
class revolution fails and that with the leadership of the working class 
revolution triumphs. In the epoch of imperialism, in no country can 
any other class lead any genuine revolution to victory. This is clearly 
proved by the fact that the many revolutions led by China¹s petty 
bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie all failed. 
The national bourgeoisie at the present stage is of great importance. 
Imperialism, a most ferocious enemy, is still standing alongside 
us. China¹s modern industry still forms a very small proportion of 
the national economy. No reliable statistics are available, but it is 
estimated, on the basis of certain data, that before the War of Resistance 
Against Japan the value of output of modern industry constituted 
only about 10 per cent of the total value of output of the national 
economy. To counter imperialist oppression and to raise her backward 
economy to a higher level, China must utilize all the factors of 
urban and rural capitalism that are beneficial and not harmful to the 
national economy and the people¹s livelihood, and we must unite with 
the national bourgeoisie in common struggle. Our present policy is 
to regulate capitalism, not to destroy it. But the national bourgeoisie 
cannot be the leader of the revolution, nor should it have the chief 
role in state power. The reason it cannot be the leader of the revolution 
and should not have the chief role in state power is that the 
social and economic position of the national bourgeoisie determines 
its weakness; it lacks foresight and sufficient courage and many of 
its members are afraid of the masses. 
Sun Yat-sen advocated ³arousing the masses of the people² or 
³giving assistance to the peasants and workers². But who is to

422 MAO TSE-TUNG 
³arouse² them or ³give assistance² to them? Sun Yat-sen had the 
petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie in mind. As a matter 
of fact, they cannot do so. Why did forty years of revolution under 
Sun Yat-sen end in failure? Because in the epoch of imperialism the 
petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie cannot lead any genuine 
revolution to victory. 
Our twenty-eight years have been quite different. We have had 
much valuable experience. A well-disciplined Party armed with the 
theory of Marxism-Leninism, using the method of self-criticism and 
linked with the masses of the people; an army under the leadership 
of such a Party; a united front of all revolutionary classes and all 
revolutionary groups under the leadership of such a Party ‹ these are 
the three main weapons with which we have defeated the enemy. They 
distinguish us from our predecessors. Relying on them, we have won 
basic victory. We have travelled a tortuous road. We have struggled 
against opportunist deviations in our Party, both Right and 
³Left². Whenever we made serious mistakes on these three matters, 
the revolution suffered setbacks. Taught by mistakes and setbacks, 
we have become wiser and handle our affairs better. It is hard for 
any political party or person to avoid mistakes, but we should make as 
few as possible. Once a mistake is made, we should correct it, and 
the more quickly and thoroughly the better. 
To sum up our experience and concentrate it into one point, it is: 
the people¹s democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the working 
class (through the Communist Party) and based upon the alliance 
of workers and peasants. This dictatorship must unite as one with 
the international revolutionary forces. This is our formula, our principal 
experience, our main programme. 
Twenty-eight years of our Party are a long period, in which we have 
accomplished only one thing ‹ we have won basic victory in the revolutionary 
war. This calls for celebration, because it is the people¹s 
victory, because it is a victory in a country as large as China. But 
we still have much work to do; to use the analogy of a journey, our 
past work is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. 
Remnants of the enemy have yet to be wiped out. The serious task 
of economic construction lies before us. We shall soon put aside some 
of the things we know well and be compelled to do things we don¹t 
know well. This means difficulties. The imperialists reckon that we 
will not be able to manage our economy; they are standing by and 
looking on, awaiting our failure.

423 ON THE PEOPLE¹S DEMOCRATIC DICTATORSHIP 
We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not 
know. We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, 
no matter who they are. We must esteem them as teachers, learning 
from them respectfully and conscientiously. We must not pretend to 
know when we do not know. We must not put on bureaucratic airs. 
If we dig into a subject for several months, for a year or two, for three 
or five years, we shall eventually master it. At first some of the 
Soviet Communists also were not very good at handling economic 
matters and the imperialists awaited their failure too. But the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union emerged victorious and, under the 
leadership of Lenin and Stalin, it learned not only how to make the 
revolution but also how to carry on construction. It has built a great 
and splendid socialist state. The Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union is our best teacher and we must learn from it. The situation 
both at home and abroad is in our favour, we can rely fully on the 
weapon of the people¹s democratic dictatorship, unite the people 
throughout the country, the reactionaries excepted, and advance 
steadily to our goal.

1 Also known as the world of Great Harmony. It refers to a society based on 
public ownership, free from class exploitation and oppression ‹ a lofty ideal long 
cherished by the Chinese people. Here the realm of Great Harmony means communist 
society.

Lenin said: ³For nearly half a century ‹ approximately from the Œforties to the 
Œnineties ‹ advanced thinkers in Russia, under the oppression of an unparalleled, 
savage and reactionary tsardom, eagerly sought for the correct revolutionary theory 
and followed each and every Œlast word¹ in Europe and America in this sphere with 
astonishing diligence and thoroughness. Russia achieved Marxism, the only correct 
revolutionary theory, veritably through suffering, by half a century of unprecedented 
torment and sacrifice, of unprecedented revolutionary heroism, incredible energy, 
devoted searching, study, testing in practice, disappointment, verification and comparison 
with European experience.² 
3 Faced with the opposition of the Chinese people to her traffic in opium, Britain 
sent forces in 1840-42 to invade Kwangtung and other coastal regions of China under 
the pretext of protecting trade. The troops in Kwangtung, led by Lin Tse-hsu, 
fought a war of resistance. 
4 Hung Hsiu-chuan (1814-64), who was born in Kwangtung, was the leader of a 
peasant revolutionary war in the middle of the 19th century. In 1851 he led a mass uprising 
in Kwangsi and proclaimed the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, 
which held many provinces and fought the Ching Dynasty for fourteen years. In 1864 
this revolutionary war failed and Hung Hsiu-chuan committed suicide by poison.

5 Kang Yu-wei (1858-1927), of Nanhai County, Kwangtung Province. In 1895, after 
China had been defeated by Japanese imperialism in the previous year, he led 
thirteen hundred candidates for the third grade in the imperial examinations at 
Peking in submitting a ³ten thousand word memorial² to Emperor Kuang Hsu, 
asking for ³constitutional reform and modernization² and asking that the autocratic 
monarchy be changed into a constitutional monarchy. In 1898, in an attempt to 
introduce reforms, the emperor promoted Kang Yu-wei together with Tan Sze-tung, 
Liang Chi-chao and others to key posts in the government. Later, the Empress 
Dowager Tzu Hsi, representing the die-hards, again took power and the reform 
movement failed. Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao fled abroad and formed the 
Protect-the-Emperor Party, which became a reactionary political faction in opposition 
to the bourgeois and petty bourgeois revolutionaries represented by Sun 
Yat-sen. Among Kang¹s works were Forgeries in the Classics of the Confucian 
Canon, Confucius as a Reformer, and Ta Tung Shu or the Book of Great Harmony. 
6 Yen Pu (1853-1921), of Foochow, Fukien Province, studied at a naval academy 
in Britain. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, he advocated constitutional 
monarchy and reforms to modernize China. His translations of T. H. Huxley¹s 
Evolution and Ethics, Adam Smith¹s The Wealth of Nations, J. S. Mill¹s System of 
Logic, Montesquieu¹s L¹Esprit des Lois, and other works were vehicles for the 
spread of European bourgeois thought in China. 
7 A system of examinations adopted by China¹s autocratic dynasties. It was 
a method used by the feudal ruling class for selecting personnel to govern the 
people and also for enticing the intellectuals. The system, dating from the 7th century, 
persisted into the early 20th century. 
8 The Revolution of 1911 overthrew the autocratic regime of the Ching 
Dynasty. On October 10 of that year, a section of the New Army, at the urging 
of the revolutionary societies of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, staged 
an uprising in Wuchang. This was followed by uprisings in other provinces, and 
very soon the rule of the Ching Dynasty crumbled. On January 1, 1912, the Provisional 
Government of the Republic of China was set up in Nanking, and Sun 
Yat-sen was elected Provisional President. The revolution achieved victory through 
the alliance of the bourgeoisie, peasants, workers and urban petty bourgeoisie. 
But because the group which led the revolution was compromising in nature, failed 
to bring real benefits to the peasants and yielded to the pressure of imperialism and 
the feudal forces, state power fell into the hands of the Northern warlord Yuan 
Shih-kai, and the revolution failed.

the Secretaries of the Provincial, Municipal and Autonomous Region Committees of 
the Chinese Communist Party. In this report Comrade Mao Tse-tung, on the basis of 
Soviet experience and our own country¹s practice, greatly developed the thesis that 
socialization of agriculture should proceed in step with socialist industrialization.

CAST AWAY ILLUSIONS, 
PREPARE FOR STRUGGLE* 
August 14, 1949
It is no accident that the U.S. State Department¹s White Paper on 
China-U.S. Relations and Secretary of State Acheson¹s Letter of Transmittal 
to President Truman1 have been released at this time. The 
publication of these documents reflects the victory of the Chinese 
people and the defeat of imperialism, it reflects the decline of the 
entire world system of imperialism. The imperialist system is riddled 
with insuperable internal contradictions, and therefore the imperialists 
are plunged into deep gloom. 
Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own doom. These 
conditions are the awakening of the great masses of the people in the 
colonies and semi-colonies and in the imperialist countries themselves. 
Imperialism has pushed the great masses of the people throughout 
the world into the historical epoch of the great struggle to abolish 
imperialism. 
Imperialism has prepared the material as well as the moral conditions 
for the struggle of the great masses of the people. 
The material conditions are factories, railways, firearms, artillery, 
and the like. Most of the powerful equipment of the Chinese People¹s 
Liberation Army comes from U.S. imperialism, some comes from 
Japanese imperialism and some is of our own manufacture. 
The British aggression against China in 18402 was followed by the 
wars of aggression against China by the Anglo-French allied forces,3 
by France,4 by Japan,5 and by the allied forces of the eight powers 
(Britain, France, Japan, tsarist Russia, Germany, the United States, 
Italy and Austria);6 by the war between Japan and tsarist Russia on 
Chinese territory;7 by Japan¹s war of aggression against China in 
China¹s Northeast, which began in 1931; by Japan¹s war of aggression 
against all China, which began in 1937 and lasted eight long years; and, 
425

426 MAO TSE-TUNG 
finally, by the latest war of aggression against the Chinese people, 
which has gone on for three years, waged to all appearances by Chiang 
Kai-shek but in reality by the United States. As stated in Acheson¹s 
Letter, the United States in this last war has given the Kuomintang 
government material aid to the value of ³more than 50 percent² 
of the latter ¹s ³monetary expenditures² and ³furnished the Chinese 
armies² (meaning the Kuomintang armies) with ³military supplies². 
It is a war in which the United States supplies the money and guns 
and Chiang Kai-shek supplies the men to fight for the United States 
and slaughter the Chinese people. All these wars of aggression, together 
with political, economic and cultural aggression and oppression, 
have caused the Chinese to hate imperialism, made them stop and 
think, ³What is all this about?² and compelled them to bring their 
revolutionary spirit into full play and become united through struggle. 
They fought, failed, fought again, failed again and fought again and 
accumulated 109 years of experience, accumulated the experience of 
hundreds of struggles, great and small, military and political, economic 
and cultural, with bloodshed and without bloodshed ‹ and 
only then won today¹s basic victory. These are the moral conditions 
without which the revolution could not be victorious. 
To serve the needs of its aggression, imperialism created the comprador 
system and bureaucrat-capital in China. Imperialist aggression 
stimulated China¹s social economy, brought about changes in it and 
created the opposites of imperialism ‹ the national industry and 
national bourgeoisie of China, and especially the Chinese proletariat 
working in enterprises run directly by the imperialists, those run by 
bureaucrat-capital and those run by the national bourgeoisie. To 
serve the needs of its aggression, imperialism ruined the Chinese 
peasants by exploiting them through the exchange of unequal values and 
thereby created great masses of poor peasants, numbering hundreds 
of millions and comprising 70 per cent of China¹s rural population. 
To serve the needs of its aggression, imperialism created for China

White Paper and Dean Acheson¹s Letter of Transmittal. They exposed the 
imperialist nature of United States policy towards China, criticized the illusions 
about U.S. imperialism harboured by some of the bourgeois intellectuals in China 
and gave a theoretical explanation of the reasons for the rise of the Chinese revolution 
and for its victory.

427 CAST AWAY ILLUSIONS, PREPARE FOR STRUGGLE 
millions of big and small intellectuals of a new type, differing from the 
old type of literatus or scholar-bureaucrat. But imperialism and its 
running dogs, the reactionary governments of China, could control 
only a part of these intellectuals and finally only a handful, such as 
Hu Shih, Fu Sze-nien and Chien Mu;8 all the rest got out of control 
and turned against them. Students, teachers, professors, technicians, 
engineers, doctors, scientists, writers, artists and government employees, 
all are revolting against or parting company with the Kuomintang. 
The Communist Party is the party of the poor and is described in the 
Kuomintang¹s widespread, all-pervasive propaganda as a band of 
people who commit murder and arson, who rape and loot, who reject 
history and culture, renounce the motherland, have no filial piety or 
respect for teachers and are impervious to all reason, who practise community 
of property and of women and employ the military tactics of 
the ³human sea² ‹ in short, a horde of fiendish monsters who perpetrate 
every conceivable crime and are unpardonably wicked. But strangely 
enough, it is this very horde that has won the support of several hundred 
million people, including the majority of the intellectuals, and especially 
the student youth. 
Part of the intellectuals still want to wait and see. They think: 
the Kuomintang is no good and the Communist Party is not necessarily 
good either, so we had better wait and see. Some support the Communist 
Party in words, but in their hearts they are waiting to see. 
They are the very people who have illusions about the United States. 
They are unwilling to draw a distinction between the U.S. imperialists, 
who are in power, and the American people, who are not. 
They are easily duped by the honeyed words of the U.S. imperialists, 
as though these imperialists would deal with People¹s China on the 
basis of equality and mutual benefit without a stern, long struggle. 
They still have many reactionary, that is to say, anti-popular, ideas 
in their heads, but they are not Kuomintang reactionaries. They are 
the middle-of-the-roaders or the right-wingers in People¹s China. They 
are the supporters of what Acheson calls ³democratic individualism². 
The deceptive manoeuvres of the Achesons still have a flimsy social 
base in China. 
Acheson¹s White Paper admits that the U.S. imperialists are at a 
complete loss as to what to do about the present situation in China. 
The Kuomintang is so impotent that no amount of help can save it 
from inevitable doom; the U.S. imperialists are losing grip over things 
and feel helpless. Acheson says in his Letter of Transmittal:

428 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The unfortunate but inescapable fact is that the ominous result 
of the civil war in China was beyond the control of the government 
of the United States. Nothing that this country did or could 
have done within the reasonable limits of its capabilities could 
have changed that result; nothing that was left undone by this 
country has contributed to it. It was the product of internal 
Chinese forces, forces which this country tried to influence but 
could not. 
According to logic, Acheson¹s conclusion should be, as some 
muddle-headed Chinese intellectuals think or say, to act like ³the 
butcher who lays down his knife and at once becomes a Buddha² or ³the 
robber who has a change of heart and becomes a virtuous man², that 
is, he should treat People¹s China on the basis of equality and mutual 
benefit and stop making trouble. But no, says Acheson, troublemaking 
will continue, and definitely so. Will there be any result? 
There will, says he. On what group of people will he rely? On the 
supporters of ³democratic individualism². Says Acheson: 
. . . ultimately the profound civilization and the democratic 
individualism of China will reassert themselves and she will throw 
off the foreign yoke. I consider that we should encourage all 
developments in China which now and in the future work toward 
this end. 
How different is the logic of the imperialists from that of the 
people! Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again . . . till 
their doom; that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the 
world over in dealing with the people¹s cause, and they will never go 
against this logic. This is a Marxist law. When we say ³imperialism 
is ferocious², we mean that its nature will never change, that the imperialists 
will never lay down their butcher knives, that they will never 
become Buddhas, till their doom. 
Fight, fail, fight again, fail again, fight again . . . till their victory; 
that is the logic of the people, and they too will never go against this 
logic. This is another Marxist law. The Russian people¹s revolution 
followed this law, and so has the Chinese people¹s revolution. 
Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. 
Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years. 
To interpret history from this viewpoint is historical materialism; 
standing in opposition to this viewpoint is historical idealism.

429 CAST AWAY ILLUSIONS, PREPARE FOR STRUGGLE 
The method of self-criticism can be applied only within the ranks 
of the people; it is impossible to persuade the imperialists and the 
Chinese reactionaries to show kindness of heart and turn from their 
evil ways. The only course is to organize forces and struggle against 
them, as in our People¹s War of Liberation and the agrarian revolution, 
to expose the imperialists, ³irritate²9 them, overthrow them, punish 
them for offences against the law and ³allow them only to behave 
themselves and not to be unruly in word or deed². Only then will 
there be any hope of dealing with imperialist foreign countries on 
the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Only then will there be 
any hope that those landlords, bureaucrat-capitalists, members of the 
reactionary Kuomintang clique and their accomplices, who have laid 
down their arms and surrendered, can be given education for transforming 
the bad into the good and be transformed, as far as possible, 
into good people. Many Chinese liberals ‹ the old-type democratic 
elements, i.e., the supporters of ³democratic individualism², whom 
Truman, Marshall, Acheson, Leighton Stuart and the like count on 
and have been trying to win over ‹ often find themselves in a passive 
position and are often wrong in their judgements on the U.S. rulers, 
on the Kuomintang, on the Soviet Union and also on the Communist 
Party of China. The reason is precisely that they do not look at, or 
disapprove of looking at, problems from the standpoint of historical 
materialism. 
It is the duty of progressives - the Communists, members of the 
democratic parties, politically conscious workers, the student youth and 
progressive intellectuals ‹ to unite with the intermediate strata, middleof-
the-roaders and backward elements of various strata, with all those 
in People¹s China who are still wavering and hesitating (these people 
will waver for a long time to come and, even after they have once 
become steady, will waver again as soon as they meet difficulties), 
give them sincere help, criticize their wavering character, educate them, 
win them over to the side of the masses, prevent the imperialists from 
pulling them over and tell them to cast away illusions and prepare 
for struggle. Let no one think that there is no more work to do now 
that victory is won. We still have to work, to do a great deal of 
patient work, before we can truly win these people over. When they 
are won over, imperialism will be entirely isolated, and Acheson will 
no longer be able to play any of his tricks. 
The slogan, ³Prepare for struggle², is addressed to those who still 
cherish certain illusions about the relations between China and the

430 MAO TSE-TUNG 
imperialist countries, especially between China and the United States. 
With regard to this question, they are still passive, their minds are 
still not made up, they are still not determined to wage a long struggle 
against U.S. (and British) imperialism because they still have illusions 
about the United States. There is still a very wide, or fairly wide, 
gap between these people and ourselves on this question. 
The publication of the U.S. White Paper and Acheson¹s Letter of 
Transmittal is worthy of celebration, because it is a bucket of cold 
water and a loss of face for those who have ideas of the old type of 
democracy or democratic individualism, who do not approve of, or do 
not quite approve of, or are dissatisfied with, or are somewhat dissatisfied 
with, or even resent, people¹s democracy, or democratic collectivism, 
or democratic centralism, or collective heroism, or patriotism 
based on internationalism ‹ but who still have patriotic feelings and 
are not Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a bucket of cold water particularly 
for those who believe that everything American is good and 
hope that China will model herself on the United States. 
Acheson openly declares that the Chinese democratic individualists 
will be ³encouraged² to throw off the so-called ³foreign yoke². That 
is to say, he calls for the overthrow of Marxism-Leninism and the 
people¹s democratic dictatorship led by the Communist Party of China. 
For this ³ism² and this system, it is alleged, are ³foreign², with no 
roots in China, imposed on the Chinese by the German, Karl Marx 
(who died sixty-six years ago), and the Russians, Lenin (who died 
twenty-five years ago) and Stalin (who is still alive); this ³ism² and 
this system, moreover, are downright bad, because they advocate the 
class struggle, the overthrow of imperialism, etc.; hence they must be 
got rid of. In this connection, it is alleged, ³the democratic individualism 
of China will reassert itself² with the ³encouragement² of 
President Truman, the backstage Commander-in-Chief Marshall, Secretary 
of State Acheson (the charming foreign mandarin responsible 
for the publication of the White Paper) and Ambassador Leighton 
Stuart who has scampered off. Acheson and his like think they are 
giving ³encouragement², but those Chinese democratic individualists 
who still have patriotic feelings, even though they believe in the United 
States, may quite possibly feel this is a bucket of cold water thrown 
on them and a loss of face; for instead of dealing with the authorities 
of the Chinese people¹s democratic dictatorship in the proper way, 
Acheson and his like are doing this filthy work and, what is more, 
they have openly published it. What a loss of face! What a loss

431 CAST AWAY ILLUSIONS, PREPARE FOR STRUGGLE 
of face! To those who are patriotic, Acheson¹s statement is no ³encouragement² 
but an insult. 
China is in the midst of a great revolution. All China is seething 
with enthusiasm. The conditions are favourable for winning over 
and uniting with all those who do not have a bitter and deep-seated 
hatred for the cause of the people¹s revolution, even though they have 
mistaken ideas. Progressives should use the White Paper to persuade 
all these persons. 
NOTES 
1 The U.S. White Paper, United States Relations with China, was published by 
the U.S. State Department on August 5, 1949. Acheson¹s Letter of Transmittal to 
Truman was dated July 30, 1949. The main body of the White Paper, divided into 
eight chapters, deals with Sino-U.S. relations in the period from 1844, when the 
United States forced China to sign the ³Treaty of Wanghia², to 1949, when victory 
was basically won throughout the country in the Chinese people¹s revolution. The 
White Paper goes into particular detail about how, in the five years from the last part 
of the War of Resistance Against Japan to 1949, the United States pursued a policy of 
support for Chiang Kai-shek and of anti-communism, opposed the Chinese people by 
every possible means and finally met with defeat. The White Paper and Acheson¹s 
Letter of Transmittal are full of distortions, omissions and fabrications, and also of 
venomous slanders and deep hatred against the Chinese people. In the quarrel within 
the U.S. reactionary camp over its policy towards China, imperialists like Truman and 
Acheson were compelled to reveal publicly through the White Paper some of the 
truth about their counter-revolutionary activities in an attempt to convince their 
opponents. Thus, in its objective effect, the White Paper became a confession by 
U.S. imperialism of its crimes of aggression against China. 
2 See ³On the People¹s Democratic Dictatorship², Note 3, p. 423 of this volume. 
3 From 1856 t o 1860 Britain and Prance jointly carried on a war of aggression 
against China, with the United States and tsarist Russia supporting them from the 
side-lines. The government of the Ching Dynasty was then devoting all its 
energy to suppressing the peasant revolution of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and 
adopted a policy of passive resistance towards the foreign aggressors. The Anglo- 
French allied forces occupied such major cities as Canton, Tientsin and Peking, 
plundered and burned down Yuan Ming Yuan Palace in Peking and forced the Ching 
government to conclude the ³Treaty of Tientsin² and the ³Treaty of Peking². The 
main provisions of these treaties included the opening as treaty ports of Tientsin, 
Newchwang, Tengchow, Taiwan, Tanshui, Chaochow, Chiungchow, Nanking, Chinkiang, 
Kiukiang and Hankow and the granting to foreigners of the special privileges 
of travel and missionary activities in China¹s interior and of inland navigation. From 
then on foreign forces of aggression extended over all China¹s coastal provinces and 
penetrated deep into the hinterland. 
4 In 1884-85 the French aggressors invaded Vietnam and the Chinese provinces of 
Kwangsi, Fukien, Taiwan and Chekiang. Chinese troops resisted vigorously and 
won a series of victories. Notwithstanding the victories in the war, the corrupt

432 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Ching government signed the humiliating ³Treaty of Tientsin², which recognized the 
occupation of Vietnam by the French and permitted their forces of aggression to 
penetrate southern China. 
5 The Sino-Japanese War of 1894. The war broke out as a result of Japan¹s 
aggression against Korea and her provocations to the Chinese land and naval forces. 
In this war the Chinese forces put up a heroic fight, but China suffered defeat owing 
to the corruption of the Ching government and its lack of preparation for resistance. 
As a result, the Ching government concluded the shameful ³Treaty of Shimonoseki² 
with Japan, under which it ceded Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, paid war reparations 
of 200 million taels of silver, permitted the Japanese to set up factories in 
China, opened Shasi, Chungking, Soochow and Hangchow as treaty ports and recognized 
Japan¹s domination over Korea. 
6 In 1900 eight imperialist powers, Britain, France, Japan, tsarist Russia, Germany, 
the United States, Italy and Austria, sent a joint force to attack China in an attempt 
to suppress the Yi Ho Tuan Uprising of the Chinese people against aggression. 
The Chinese people resisted heroically. The allied forces of the eight powers captured 
Taku and occupied Tientsin and Peking. In 1901 the Ching government concluded 
a treaty with the eight imperialist countries; its main provisions were that China had 
to pay those countries the enormous sum of 450 million taels of silver as war reparations 
and grant them the special privilege of stationing troops in Peking and in the 
area from Peking to Tientsin to Shanhaikuan. 
7 This was the imperialist war fought between Japan and tsarist Russia in 1904-05 
to grab China¹s Northeast and Korea. As the war was fought mainly in the area 
of Fengtien (now Shenyang) and Liaoyang and around the port of Lushun in China¹s 
Northeast, it caused enormous losses to the Chinese people. As a result of the war 
tsarist Russia was defeated and supplanted by Japanese imperialism in the dominant 
role in China¹s Northeast. Under the peace treaty (the Treaty of Portsmouth) concluded 
at the end of this war tsarist Russia also recognized Japan¹s exclusive control 
over Korea. 
8 Hu Shih, who was formerly a university professor, university president and 
ambassador of the Kuomintang government to the United States, is a well-known 
apologist for U.S. imperialism among Chinese bourgeois intellectuals. Fu Sze-nien 
and Chien Mu, also university professors, were scholars serving the reactionary 
Kuomintang government.

FAREWELL, LEIGHTON STUART! 
August 18, 1949
It is understandable that the date chosen for the publication of 
the U.S. White Paper was August 5, a time when Leighton Stuart1 
had departed from Nanking for Washington but had not yet arrived 
there, since Leighton Stuart is a symbol of the complete defeat of the 
U.S. policy of aggression. Leighton Stuart is an American born in 
China; he has fairly wide social connections and spent many years 
running missionary schools in China; he once sat in a Japanese gaol 
during the War of Resistance; he used to pretend to love both the 
United States and China and was able to deceive quite a number of 
Chinese. Hence, he was picked out by George C. Marshall, was 
made U.S. ambassador to China and became a celebrity in the Marshall 
group. In the eyes of the Marshall group he had only one fault, 
namely, that the whole period when he was ambassador to China as 
an exponent of their policy was the very period in which that policy 
was utterly defeated by the Chinese people; that was no small 
responsibility. It is only natural that the White Paper, which is 
designed to evade this responsibility, should have been published at 
a time when Leighton Stuart was on his way to Washington but had 
not yet arrived. 
The war to turn China into a U.S. colony, a war in which the 
United States of America supplies the money and guns and Chiang 
Kai-shek the men to fight for the United States and slaughter the 
Chinese people, has been an important component of the U.S. 
imperialist policy of world-wide aggression since World War II. The 
U.S. policy of aggression has several targets. The three main targets 
are Europe, Asia and the Americas. China, the centre of gravity in 
Asia, is a large country with a population of 475 million; by seizing 
China, the United States would possess all of Asia. With its Asian 
front consolidated, U.S. imperialism could concentrate its forces on 
433

434 MAO TSE-TUNG 
attacking Europe. U.S. imperialism considers its front in the Americas 
relatively secure. These are the smug over-all calculations of the 
U.S. aggressors. 
But in the first place, the American people and the peoples of the 
world do not want war. Secondly, the attention of the United States 
has largely been absorbed by the awakening of the peoples of Europe, 
by the rise of the People¹s Democracies in Eastern Europe, and 
particularly by the towering presence of the Soviet Union, this unprecedentedly 
powerful bulwark of peace bestriding Europe and Asia, 
and by its strong resistance to the U.S. policy of aggression. Thirdly, 
and this is most important, the Chinese people have awakened, and 
the armed forces and the organized strength of the people under the 
leadership of the Communist Party of China have become more 
powerful than ever before. Consequently, the ruling clique of U.S. 
imperialism has been prevented from adopting a policy of direct, 
large-scale armed attacks on China and instead has adopted a policy 
of helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war. 
U.S. naval, ground and air forces did participate in the war in 
China. There were U.S. naval bases in Tsingtao, Shanghai and Taiwan. 
U.S. troops were stationed in Peiping, Tientsin, Tangshan, 
Chinwangtao, Tsingtao, Shanghai and Nanking. The U.S. air force 
controlled all of China¹s air space and took aerial photographs of all 
China¹s strategic areas for military maps. At the town of Anping 
near Peiping, at Chiutai near Changchun, at Tangshan and in the 
Eastern Shantung Peninsula, U.S. troops and other military personnel 
clashed with the People¹s Liberation Army and on several occasions 
were captured.2 Chennault¹s air fleet took an extensive part in the 
civil war.3 Besides transporting troops for Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. 
air force bombed and sank the cruiser Chungking, which had mutinied 
against the Kuomintang.4 All these were acts of direct participation 
in the war, although they fell short of an open declaration of war and 
were not large in scale, and although the principal method of U.S. 
aggression was the large-scale supply of money, munitions and advisers 
to help Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war. 
The use of this method by the United States was determined by 
the objective situation in China and the rest of the world, and not by 
any lack of desire on the part of the Truman-Marshall group, the 
ruling clique of U.S. imperialism, to launch direct aggression against 
China. Moreover, at the outset of its help to Chiang Kai-shek in 
fighting the civil war, a crude farce was staged in which the United

435 FAREWELL, LEIGHTON STUART! 
States appeared as mediator in the conflict between the Kuomintang 
and the Communist Party; this was an attempt to soften up the Communist 
Party of China, deceive the Chinese people and thus gain 
control of all China without fighting. The peace negotiations failed, 
the deception fell through and the curtain rose on the war. 
Liberals or ³democratic individualists² who cherish illusions about 
the United States and have short memories! Please look at Acheson¹s 
own words: 
When peace came the United States was confronted with three 
possible alternatives in China: (1) it could have pulled out lock, 
stock and barrel; (2) it could have intervened militarily on a major 
scale to assist the Nationalists to destroy the Communists; (3) it 
could, while assisting the Nationalists to assert their authority 
over as much of China as possible, endeavor to avoid a civil war 
by working for a compromise between the two sides. 
Why didn¹t the United States adopt the first of these policies? 
Acheson says: 
The first alternative would, and I believe American public 
opinion at the time so felt, have represented an abandonment of 
our international responsibilities and of our traditional policy of 
friendship for China before we had made a determined effort to 
be of assistance. 
So that¹s how things stand: the ³international responsibilities² of the 
United States and its ³traditional policy of friendship for China² are 
nothing but intervention against China. Intervention is called assuming 
international responsibilities and showing friendship for China; 
as to non-intervention, it simply won¹t do. Here Acheson defiles 
U.S. public opinion; his is the ³public opinion² of Wall Street, not the 
public opinion of the American people. 
Why didn¹t the United States adopt the second of these policies? 
Acheson says: 
The second alternative policy, while it may look attractive 
theoretically and in retrospect, was wholly impracticable. The 
Nationalists had been unable to destroy the Communists during 
the 10 years before the war. Now after the war the Nationalists 
were, as indicated above, weakened, demoralized, and unpopular. 
They had quickly dissipated their popular support and prestige in 
the areas liberated from the Japanese by the conduct of their civil

436 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and military officials. The Communists on the other hand were 
much stronger than they had ever been and were in control of 
most of North China. Because of the ineffectiveness of the Nationalist 
forces which was later to be tragically demonstrated, the 
Communists probably could have been dislodged only by American 
arms. It is obvious that the American people would not have 
sanctioned such a colossal commitment of our armies in 1945 o r 
later. We therefore came to the third alternative policy. . . . 
What a splendid idea! The United States supplies the money 
and guns and Chiang Kai-shek the men to fight for the United States 
and slaughter the Chinese people, to ³destroy the Communists² and 
turn China into a U.S. colony, so that the United States may fulfil its 
³international responsibilities² and carry out its ³traditional policy 
of friendship for China². 
Although the Kuomintang was corrupt and incompetent, ³demoralized 
and unpopular², the United States nevertheless supplied it 
with money and guns and made it fight. Direct armed intervention 
was all right, ³theoretically². It also seems all right ³in retrospect² 
to the rulers of the United States. For direct armed intervention 
would really have been interesting and it might ³look attractive². 
But it would not have worked in practice, for ³it is obvious that the 
American people would not have sanctioned² it. Not that the imperialist 
group of Truman, Marshall, Acheson and their like did not 
desire it ‹ they very much desired it ‹ but the situation in China, in 
the United States and in the world as a whole (a point Acheson does 
not mention) did not permit it; they had to give up their preference 
and take the third way. 
Let those Chinese who believe that ³victory is possible even 
without international help² listen. Acheson is giving you a lesson. 
Acheson is a good teacher, giving lessons free of charge, and he is 
telling the whole truth with tireless zeal and great candour. The 
United States refrained from dispatching large forces to attack China, 
not because the U.S. government didn¹t want to, but because it had 
worries. First worry: the Chinese people would oppose it, and the 
U.S. government was afraid of getting hopelessly bogged down in a 
quagmire. Second worry: the American people would oppose it, and 
so the U.S. government dared not order mobilization. Third worry: 
the people of the Soviet Union, of Europe and of the rest of the 
world would oppose it, and the U.S. government would face universal

437 FAREWELL, LEIGHTON STUART! 
condemnation. Acheson¹s charming candour has its limits and he is 
unwilling to mention the third worry. The reason is he is afraid of 
losing face before the Soviet Union, he is afraid that the Marshall 
Plan in Europe,5 which is already a failure despite pretences to the 
contrary, may end dismally in total collapse. 
Let those Chinese who are short-sighted, muddle-headed liberals 
or democratic individualists listen. Acheson is giving you a lesson; 
he is a good teacher for you. He has made a clean sweep of your 
fancied U.S. humanity, justice and virtue. Isn¹t that so? Can you 
find a trace of humanity, justice or virtue in the White Paper or in 
Acheson¹s Letter of Transmittal? 
True, the United States has science and technology. But unfortunately 
they are in the grip of the capitalists, not in the hands of the 
people, and are used to exploit and oppress the people at home and 
to perpetrate aggression and to slaughter people abroad. There is 
also ³democracy² in the United States. But unfortunately it is only 
another name for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie by itself. The 
United States has plenty of money. But unfortunately it is willing to 
give money only to the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, who are rotten 
to the core. The United States, it is said, is and will be quite willing 
to give money to its fifth column in China, but is unwilling to give it 
to the ordinary run of liberals or democratic individualists, who are 
much too bookish and do not know how to appreciate favours, and 
naturally it is even more unwilling to give money to the Communists. 
Money may be given, but only conditionally. What is the condition? 
Follow the United States. The Americans have sprinkled some relief 
flour in Peiping, Tientsin and Shanghai to see who will stoop to pick 
it up. Like Chiang Tai Kung fishing,6 they have cast the line for 
the fish who want to be caught. But he who swallows food handed 
out in contempt7 will get a bellyache. 
We Chinese have backbone. Many who were once liberals or 
democratic individualists have stood up to the U.S. imperialists and 
their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries. Wen Yi-to rose 
to his full height and smote the table, angrily faced the Kuomintang 
pistols and died rather than submit.8 Chu Tse-ching, though seriously 
ill, starved to death rather than accept U.S. ³relief food².9 Han Yu of 
the Tang Dynasty wrote a ³Eulogy of Po Yi²,10 praising a man with 
quite a few ³democratic individualist² ideas, who shirked his duty 
towards the people of his own country, deserted his post and opposed 
the people¹s war of liberation of that time, led by King Wu. He

438 MAO TSE-TUNG 
lauded the wrong man. We should write eulogies of Wen Yi-to and 
Chu Tse-ching who demonstrated the heroic spirit of our nation. 
What matter if we have to face some difficulties? Let them 
blockade us! Let them blockade us for eight or ten years! By that 
time all of China¹s problems will have been solved. Will the Chinese 
cower before difficulties when they are not afraid even of death? 
Lao Tzu said, ³The people fear not death, why threaten them with 
it?²11 U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kaishek 
reactionaries, have not only ³threatened² us with death but 
actually put many of us to death. Besides people like Wen Yi-to, 
they have killed millions of Chinese in the last three years with U.S. 
carbines, machine-guns, mortars, bazookas, howitzers, tanks and bombs 
dropped from aeroplanes. This situation is now coming to an end. 
They have been defeated. It is we who are going in to attack them, 
not they who are coming out to attack us. They will soon be finished. 
True, the few problems left to us, such as blockade, unemployment, 
famine, inflation and rising prices, are difficulties, but we have already 
begun to breathe more easily than in the past three years. We have 
come triumphantly through the ordeal of the last three years, why 
can¹t we overcome these few difficulties of today? Why can¹t we 
live without the United States? 
When the People¹s Liberation Army crossed the Yangtse River, 
the U.S. colonial government at Nanking fled helter-skelter. Yet 
His Excellency Ambassador Stuart sat tight, watching wide-eyed, 
hoping to set up shop under a new signboard and to reap some profit. 
But what did he see? Apart from the People¹s Liberation Army 
marching past, column after column, and the workers, peasants and 
students rising in hosts, he saw something else ‹ the Chinese liberals 
or democratic individualists turning out in force, shouting slogans and 
talking revolution together with the workers, peasants, soldiers and 
students. In short, he was left out in the cold, ³standing all alone, 
body and shadow comforting each other².12 There was nothing 
more for him to do, and he had to take to the road, his briefcase 
under his arm. 
There are still some intellectuals and other people in China who 
have muddled ideas and illusions about the United States. Therefore 
we should explain things to them, win them over, educate them 
and unite with them, so they will come over to the side of the people 
and not fall into the snares set by imperialism. But the prestige of 
U.S. imperialism among the Chinese people is completely bankrupt,

439 FAREWELL, LEIGHTON STUART! 
and the White Paper is a record of its bankruptcy. Progressives 
should make good use of the White Paper to educate the Chinese 
people. 
Leighton Stuart has departed and the White Paper has arrived. 
Very good. Very good. Both events are worth celebrating. 
NOTES 
1 John Leighton Stuart, who was born in China in 1876, was always a loyal agent of 
U.S. cultural aggression in China. He started missionary work in China in 1905 and in 
1909 became president of Yenching University, which was established by the United 
States in Peking. On July 11, 1946, he was appointed U.S. ambassador to China. 
He actively supported the Kuomintang reactionaries in prosecuting the civil war 
and carried out various political intrigues against the Chinese people. On August 2, 
1949, because all the efforts of U.S. imperialism to obstruct the victory of the 
Chinese people¹s revolution had completely failed, Leighton Stuart had to leave 
China quietly. 
2 Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the armed forces of the United 
States, with the purpose of aggression against China¹s territory and sovereignty and 
of interference in her domestic affairs, landed in China and stationed themselves at 
Peiping, Shanghai, Nanking, Tientsin, Tangshan, Kaiping, Chinwangtao, Chinghai, 
Tsingtao and other places. In addition, they repeatedly invaded the Liberated 
Areas. On July 29, 1946, U.S. troops in Tientsin, in co-ordination with Chiang 
Kai-shek¹s bandit troops, assaulted the town of Anping, Hsiangho County, Hopei 
Province; this is the Anping Incident referred to in the text. On March 1, 1947, 
U.S. troops made a military reconnaissance of the position of the People¹s Liberation 
Army at Hohsipao, situated between Changchun and Chiutai in northeastern China. 
On June 16, 1946, U.S. troops at Tangshan, Hopei Province, raided Sungchiaying and 
other places; in July they raided Sanho Village, Luanhsien County, and Hsihonan 
Village, Changli County, both near Tangshan. Of the numerous attacks on the 
Eastern Shantung Peninsula, the most widely-known were two, one by U.S. aircraft 
and warships on Langnuankou and Hsiaoli Island, Mouping County, on August 28, 
1947, and the other by U.S. forces on Wanglintao Village, north of Chimo County, 
on December 25, 1947 in co-ordination with Chiang Kai-shek¹s bandit troops. In 
all these cases in which the U.S. forces committed acts of aggression by invading the 
Liberated Areas, the Chinese People¹s Liberation Army or the local people¹s armed 
forces took just action in self-defence. 
3 Claire Lee Chennault was at one time U.S. adviser to the Kuomintang government¹s 
air force. After the Japanese surrender, he organized a group of the U.S. 
14th Air Force personnel into an air transport corps to help the Kuomintang fight the 
civil war. His air transport corps took a direct part in the criminal reconnoitring and 
bombing of the Liberated Areas.

5 On June 5, 1947, U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall made a speech at 
Harvard University, putting forward a plan for so-called U.S. ³aid² to rehabilitate 
Europe. The ³European Recovery Programme² subsequently drawn up by the U.S. 
government on the basis of the speech was known as the ³Marshall Plan². 
6 Chiang Tai Kung lived in the Chou Dynasty. According to a legend, he once 
fished in the Weishui River, holding a rod without hook or bait three feet above the 
water, and saying, ³The fish that is destined to be caught will come up.² (From 
Stories About King Wu¹s Expedition Against the Yin Dynasty.) 
7 ³Food handed out in contempt² refers to alms handed out as an insult. It is 
an allusion to a story in the Book of Rites, which tells of a hungry man in the State 
of Chi, who would rather starve to death than accept food given him insultingly. 
8 Wen Yi-to (1899-1946), famed Chinese poet, scholar and university professor. 
In 1943 he began to take an active part in the struggle for democracy out of bitter 
hatred for the reaction and corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek government. After 
the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously opposed the Kuomintang¹s 
conspiracy with U.S. imperialism to start civil war against the people. On July 15, 
1946, he was assassinated in Kunming by Kuomintang thugs. 
9 Chu Tse-ching (1898-1948), Chinese man of letters and university professor. 
After the War of Resistance, he actively supported the student movement against 
the Chiang Kai-shek regime. In June 1948 he signed a declaration protesting against 
the revival of Japanese militarism, which was being fostered by the United States, and 
rejecting ³U.S. relief² flour. He was then living in great poverty. He died in 
Peiping on August 12, 1948, from poverty and illness, but even on his death-bed he 
enjoined his family not to buy the U.S. flour rationed by the Kuomintang government.

After the downfall of the House of Yin, he fled to the Shouyang Mountain and

WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO DISCUSS 
THE WHITE PAPER 
August 28, 1949
We have criticized the U.S. White Paper and Acheson¹s Letter 
of Transmittal in three articles (³A Confession of Helplessness²,1 
³Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle² and ³Farewell, Leighton 
Stuart!²). Our criticism has aroused widespread attention and discussion 
in all democratic parties, people¹s organizations, the press, 
universities and schools, and among democratic personages in all walks 
of life throughout the country; they have issued many correct and 
useful declarations, statements and comments. Forums on the White 
Paper are being held and the entire discussion is still developing. The 
discussion covers Sino-U.S. relations, Sino-Soviet relations, China¹s 
foreign relations in the past hundred years, the mutual relation between 
the Chinese revolution and the revolutionary forces of the world, the 
relation between the Kuomintang reactionaries and the Chinese people, 
the proper attitude to be adopted by the democratic parties, people¹s 
organizations and democratic personages in all walks of life in the 
struggle against imperialism, the proper attitude to be adopted by 
liberals or so-called democratic individualists on the country¹s internal 
and external relations as a whole, the ways of dealing with new 
imperialist intrigues, and so on. All this is very good and is of great 
educational value. 
The whole world is now discussing the Chinese revolution and the 
U.S. White Paper. This is no accident, this shows the great significance 
of the Chinese revolution in world history. As for us Chinese, though 
we have basically won victory in our revolution, we have had no 
opportunity for a long time to discuss thoroughly the interrelations of 
this revolution and various forces at home and abroad. Such a discussion 
is necessary, and now an opportunity has been found in the 
discussion of the U.S. White Paper. We had no opportunity for this 
kind of discussion before because we had not won basic victory in 
441

442 MAO TSE-TUNG 
the revolution, because Chinese and foreign reactionaries had cut off 
the big cities from the People¹s Liberated Areas and because some 
aspects of the contradictions had not yet been fully revealed by the 
development of the revolution. Now the situation is different. The 
greater part of China has been liberated, all aspects of the internal 
and external contradictions have been fully revealed, and just at this 
moment the United States has published the White Paper. Thus the 
opportunity for the discussion has been found. 
The White Paper is a counter-revolutionary document which 
openly demonstrates U.S. imperialist intervention in China. In this 
respect, imperialism has departed from its normal practice. The great, 
victorious Chinese revolution has compelled one section or faction of 
the U.S. imperialist clique to reply to attacks from another by publishing 
certain authentic data on its own actions against the Chinese 
people and drawing reactionary conclusions from the data, because 
otherwise it could not get by. The fact that public revelation has 
replaced concealment is a sign that imperialism has departed from 
its normal practice. Until a few weeks ago, before the publication 
of the White Paper, the governments of the imperialist countries, 
though they engaged in counter-revolutionary activities every day, had 
never told the truth in their statements or official documents but had 
filled or at least flavoured them with professions of humanity, justice 
and virtue. This is still true of British imperialism, an old hand at 
trickery and deception, as well as of several other smaller imperialist 
countries. Opposed by the people on the one hand and by another 
faction in their own camp on the other, the newly arrived, upstart 
and neurotic U.S. imperialist group ‹ Truman, Marshall, Acheson, 
Leighton Stuart and others ‹ have considered it necessary and practicable 
to reveal publicly some (but not all) of their counter-revolutionary 
doings in order to argue with opponents in their own camp as to which 
kind of counter-revolutionary tactics is the more clever. In this way 
they have tried to convince their opponents so that they can go on 
applying what they regard as the cleverer counter-revolutionary tactics. 
Two factions of counter-revolutionaries have been competing with 
each other. One said, ³Ours is the best method.² The other said, 
³Ours is the best.² When the dispute was at its hottest, one faction 
suddenly laid its cards on the table and revealed many of its treasured 
tricks of the past ‹ and there you have the White Paper. 
And so the White Paper has become material for the education 
of the Chinese people. For many years, a number of Chinese (at one

443 WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO DISCUSS THE WHITE PAPER 
time a great number) only half-believed what we Communists said on 
many questions, mainly on the nature of imperialism and of socialism, 
and thought, ³It may not be so.² This situation has undergone a 
change since August 5, 1949. For Acheson gave them a lesson and 
he spoke in his capacity as U.S. Secretary of State. In the case of 
certain data and conclusions, what he said coincides with what we 
Communists and other progressives have been saying. Once this 
happened, people could not but believe us, and many had their eyes 
opened ‹ ³So that¹s the way things really were!² 
Acheson begins his Letter of Transmittal to Truman with the story 
of how he compiled the White Paper. His White Paper, he says, is 
different from all others, it is very objective and very frank: 
This is a frank record of an extremely complicated and most 
unhappy period in the life of a great country to which the United 
States has long been attached by ties of closest friendship. No 
available item has been omitted because it contains statements 
critical of our policy or might be the basis of future criticism. 
The inherent strength of our system is the responsiveness of the 
Government to an informed and critical public opinion. It is 
precisely this informed and critical public opinion which totalitarian 
governments, whether Rightist or Communist, cannot endure and 
do not tolerate. 
Certain ties do exist between the Chinese people and the American 
people. Through their joint efforts, these ties may develop in the 
future to the point of the ³closest friendship². But the obstacles 
placed by the Chinese and U.S. reactionaries were and still are a 
great hindrance to these ties. Moreover, because the reactionaries of 
both countries have told many lies to their peoples and played many 
filthy tricks, that is, spread much bad propaganda and done many bad 
deeds, the ties between the two peoples are far from close. What 
Acheson calls ³ties of closest friendship² are those between the reactionaries 
of the two countries, not between the peoples. Here Acheson 
is neither objective nor frank, he confuses the relations between the two 
peoples with those between the reactionaries. For the peoples of the 
two countries the victory of the Chinese revolution and the defeat of 
the Chinese and U.S. reactionaries are the most joyful events that 
have ever happened, and the present period is the happiest of their 
lives. Conversely, it is only for Truman, Marshall, Acheson, Leighton 
Stuart and other U.S. reactionaries and for Chiang Kai-shek, H. H.

444 MAO TSE-TUNG 
Kung, T. V. Soong, Chen Li-fu, Li Tsung-jen, Pai Chung-hsi and other 
Chinese reactionaries that it is truly ³an extremely complicated and 
most unhappy period² in their lives. 
In considering public opinion, the Achesons have mixed up the 
public opinion of the reactionaries with that of the people. Towards 
the public opinion of the people, the Achesons have no ³responsiveness² 
whatsoever and are blind and deaf. For years they have 
turned a deaf ear to the opposition voiced by the people of the United 
States, China and the rest of the world to the reactionary foreign 
policy of the U.S. government. What does Acheson mean by ³informed 
and critical public opinion²? Nothing but the numerous 
instruments of propaganda, such as the newspapers, news agencies, 
periodicals and broadcasting stations which are controlled by the 
two reactionary parties in the United States, the Republicans and the 
Democrats, and which specialize in the manufacture of lies and in 
threats against the people. Of these things Acheson says rightly that 
the Communists ³cannot endure and do not tolerate² them (nor do 
the people). That is why we have closed down the imperialist offices 
of information, stopped the imperialist news agencies from distributing 
their dispatches to the Chinese press and forbidden them the freedom 
to go on poisoning the souls of the Chinese people on Chinese soil. 
To say that a government led by the Communist Party is a ³totalitarian 
government² is also half true. It is a government that exercises 
dictatorship over domestic and foreign reactionaries and does not 
give any of them any freedom to carry on their counter-revolutionary 
activities. Becoming angry, the reactionaries rail: ³Totalitarian 
government!² Indeed, this is absolutely true so far as the power of 
the people¹s government to suppress the reactionaries is concerned. 
This power is now written into our programme; it will also be written 
into our constitution. Like food and clothing, this power is something 
a victorious people cannot do without even for a moment. It 
is an excellent thing, a protective talisman, an heirloom, which should 
under no circumstances be discarded before the thorough and total 
abolition of imperialism abroad and of classes within the country. 
The more the reactionaries rail ³totalitarian government², the more 
obviously is it a treasure. But Acheson¹s remark is also half false. 
For the masses of the people, a government of the people¹s democratic 
dictatorship led by the Communist Party is not dictatorial or autocratic 
but democratic. It is the people¹s own government. The working 
personnel of this government must respectfully heed the voice of the

445 WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO DISCUSS THE WHITE PAPER 
people. At the same time, they are teachers of the people, teaching 
the people by the method of self-education or self-criticism. 
As to what Acheson calls a ³Rightist totalitarian government², the 
U.S. government has ranked first in the world among such governments 
since the downfall of the fascist governments of Germany, Italy 
and Japan. All bourgeois governments, including the governments 
of the German, Italian and Japanese reactionaries which are being 
shielded by imperialism, are governments of this type. The Tito 
government of Yugoslavia has now become an accomplice of this 
gang. The U.S. and British governments belong to the type in which 
the bourgeoisie, and this class alone, exercises dictatorship over the 
people. Contrary in all respects to the people¹s government, this type 
of government practises so-called democracy for the bourgeoisie but 
is dictatorial towards the people. The governments of Hitler, 
Mussolini, Tojo, Franco and Chiang Kai-shek discarded the veil of 
democracy for the bourgeoisie or never used it because the class 
struggle in their countries was extremely intense and they found it 
advantageous to discard, or not to use, this veil lest the people too 
should make use of it. The U.S. government still has a veil of 
democracy, but it has been cut down to a tiny patch by the U.S. 
reactionaries and become very faded, and is not what it used to be in 
the days of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln.2 The reason is that 
the class struggle has become more intense. When the class struggle 
becomes still more intense, the veil of U.S. democracy will inevitably 
be flung to the four winds. 
As everybody can see, Acheson makes a great many mistakes the 
moment he opens his mouth. This is inevitable because he is a 
reactionary. As to how much of a ³frank record² the White Paper 
is, we think it is frank and not frank at the same time. The Achesons 
are frank where they imagine that frankness will benefit their party 
or faction. Otherwise, they are not. To feign frankness is a ruse 
of war.

United States. Washington was the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army 
of the colonies during the American War of Independence (1775-83) and the first 
president of the United States. Jefferson drafted the American Declaration of 
Independence and became president of the United States. Lincoln advocated the 
abolition of Negro slavery in the United States and during his presidency led the 
war against the slave-owners of the southern states (1861-65); he issued the 
³Emancipation Proclamation² in 1862.

³FRIENDSHIP² OR AGGRESSION? 
August 30, 1949 
Seeking to justify aggression, Dean Acheson harps on ³friendship² 
and throws in lots of ³principles². 
Acheson says: 
The interest of the people and the Government of the United 
States in China goes far back into our history. Despite the distance 
and broad differences in background which separate China 
and the United States, our friendship for that country has always 
been intensified by the religious, philanthropic and cultural ties 
which have united the two peoples, and has been attested by 
many acts of good will over a period of many years, including the 
use of the Boxer indemnity for the education of Chinese students, 
the abolition of extraterritoriality during the Second World War, 
and our extensive aid to China during and since the close of the 
War. The record shows that the United States has consistently 
maintained and still maintains those fundamental principles of 
our foreign policy toward China which include the doctrine of the 
Open Door, respect for the administrative and territorial integrity 
of China, and opposition to any foreign domination of China. 
Acheson is telling a bare-faced lie when he describes aggression as 
³friendship². 
The history of the aggression against China by U.S. imperialism, 
from 1840 when it helped the British in the Opium War to the time 
it was thrown out of China by the Chinese people, should be written 
into a concise textbook for the education of Chinese youth. The 
United States was one of the first countries to force China to cede 
extraterritoriality1 ‹ witness the Treaty of Wanghia2 o f 1844, the first 
treaty ever signed between China and the United States, a treaty to 
which the White Paper refers. In this very treaty, the United States 
447

448 MAO TSE-TUNG 
compelled China to accept American missionary activity, in addition 
to imposing such terms as the opening of five ports for trade. For a 
very long period, U.S. imperialism laid greater stress than other imperialist 
countries on activities in the sphere of spiritual aggression, 
extending from religious to ³philanthropic² and cultural undertakings. 
According to certain statistics, the investments of U.S. missionary and 
³philanthropic² organizations in China totalled 41,900,000 U.S. dollars, 
and 14.7 per cent of the assets of the missionary organizations 
were in medical service, 38.2 per cent in education and 47.1 per cent 
in religious activities.3 Many well-known educational institutions in 
China, such as Yenching University, Peking Union Medical College, 
the Huei Wen Academies, St. John¹s University, the University of 
Nanking, Soochow University, Hangchow Christian College, Hsiangya 
Medical School, West China Union University and Lingnan University, 
were established by Americans.4 It was in this field that 
Leighton Stuart made a name for himself; that was how he became 
U.S. ambassador to China. Acheson and his like know what they 
are talking about, and there is a background for his statement that 
³our friendship for that country has always been intensified by the 
religious, philanthropic and cultural ties which have united the two 
peoples². It was all for the sake of ³intensifying friendship², we 
are told, that the United States worked so hard and deliberately 
at running these undertakings for 105 years after the signing of the 
Treaty of 1844. 
Participation in the Eight-Power Allied Expedition to defeat China 
in 1900, the extortion of the ³Boxer indemnity² and the later use of 
this fund ³for the education of Chinese students² for purposes of 
spiritual aggression ‹ this too counts as an expression of ³friendship². 
Despite the ³abolition² of extraterritoriality, the culprit in the 
raping of Shen Chung was declared not guilty and released by the 
U.S. Navy Department on his return to the United States5 ‹ this 
counts as another expression of ³friendship². 
³Aid to China during and since the close of the War², totalling 
over 4,500 million U.S. dollars according to the White Paper, but over 
5,914 million U.S. dollars according to our computation, was given to 
help Chiang Kai-shek slaughter several million Chinese ‹ this counts 
as yet another expression of ³friendship². 
All the ³friendship² shown to China by U.S. imperialism over the 
past 109 years (since 1840 when the United States collaborated with 
Britain in the Opium War), and especially the great act of ³friend

449 ³FRIENDSHIP² OR AGGRESSION? 
ship² in helping Chiang Kai-shek slaughter several million Chinese in 
the last few years ‹ all this had one purpose, namely, it ³consistently 
maintained and still maintains those fundamental principles of our 
foreign policy toward China which include the doctrine of the Open 
Door, respect for the administrative and territorial integrity of China, 
and opposition to any foreign domination of China². 
Several million Chinese were killed for no other purpose than 
first, to maintain the Open Door, second, to respect the administrative 
and territorial integrity of China and, third, to oppose any foreign 
domination of China. 
Today, the only doors still open to Acheson and his like are in 
small strips of land, such as Canton and Taiwan, and only in these 
places is the first of these sacred principles ³still maintained². In 
other places, in Shanghai for instance, the door was open after liberation, 
but now some one is using U.S. warships and their big guns to 
enforce the far from sacred principle of the Blockaded Door. 
Today, it is only in small strips of land, such as Canton and Taiwan, 
that thanks to Acheson¹s second sacred principle administrative 
and territorial ³integrity² is ³still maintained². All other places are 
out of luck, and administration and territory have fallen to pieces. 
Today, it is only in places such as Canton and Taiwan that thanks 
to Acheson¹s third sacred principle all ³foreign domination², including 
U.S. domination, has been successfully done away with through 
the ³opposition² of Acheson and his like; therefore such places are 
still dominated by the Chinese. The rest of the land of China ‹ the 
mere mention makes one weep ‹ is all gone, all dominated by foreigners, 
and the Chinese there have one and all been turned into slaves. 
Up to this point in his writing, His Excellency Dean Acheson did not 
have time to indicate what country these foreigners came from, but 
it becomes clear as one reads on, so there is no need to ask. 
Whether non-interference in China¹s domestic affairs also counts 
as a principle, Acheson didn¹t say; probably it does not. Such is the 
logic of the U.S. mandarins. Anyone who reads Acheson¹s Letter 
of Transmittal to the end will attest to its superior logic. 
NOTES 
1 ³Extraterritoriality² here refers to consular jurisdiction. It was one of the 
special privileges for aggression which the imperialists wrested from China. Under 
the so-called consular jurisdiction, nationals of imperialist countries residing in China

450 MAO TSE-TUNG 
were not subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese law; when they committed crimes or 
became defendants in civil lawsuits, they could be tried only in their respective 
countries¹ consular courts in China, and the Chinese government could not intervene. 
2 The ³Treaty of Wanghia² was the first unequal treaty signed as a result of 
U.S. aggression against China. The United States, taking advantage of China¹s 
defeat in the Opium War, compelled the Ching Dynasty to sign this treaty, also 
called the ³Sino-American Treaty on the Opening of Five Ports for Trade², in 
Wanghia Village near Macao in July 1844. Its thirty-four articles stipulated that 
whatever rights and privileges, including consular jurisdiction, were gained by Britain 
through the Treaty of Nanking and its annexes would also accrue to the United States.

4 Yenching University was in Peiping; the Huei Wen Academies, in Peiping and 
Nanking; St. John¹s University, in Shanghai; Hsiangya Medical School (Yale in 
China), in Changsha; West China Union University, in Chengtu; and Lingnan 
University, in Canton. 
5 William Pierson, a corporal, and other U.S. marines raped Shen Chung, a girl 
student of Peking University, in Peiping on December 24, 1946. This aroused the great 
indignation of the people throughout the country against the atrocities of the U.S. 
forces. In January 1947, brushing aside the people¹s protests, the Kuomintang 
government handed over the chief criminal, Pierson, to the Americans to be dealt 
with at their discretion. In August the U.S. Navy Department set this criminal free 
with a verdict of ³not guilty².

THE BANKRUPTCY OF 
THE IDEALIST CONCEPTION OF HISTORY 
September 16, 1949
The Chinese should thank Acheson, spokesman of the U.S. bourgeoisie, 
not merely because he has explicitly confessed to the fact that 
the United States supplied the money and guns and Chiang Kai-shek 
the men to fight for the United States and slaughter the Chinese people 
and because he has thus given Chinese progressives evidence with 
which to convince the backward elements. You see, hasn¹t Acheson 
himself confessed that the great, sanguinary war of the last few years, 
which cost the lives of millions of Chinese, was planned and organized 
by U.S. imperialism? The Chinese should thank Acheson, again not 
merely because he has openly declared that the United States intends 
to recruit the so-called ³democratic individualists² in China, organize 
a U.S. fifth column and overthrow the People¹s Government led by 
the Communist Party of China and has thus alerted the Chinese, 
especially those tinged with liberalism, who are promising each other 
not to be taken in by the Americans and are all on guard against the 
underhand intrigues of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese should thank 
Acheson also because he has fabricated wild tales about modern 
Chinese history; and his conception of history is precisely that shared 
by a section of the Chinese intellectuals, namely, the bourgeois idealist 
conception of history. Hence, a refutation of Acheson may benefit 
many Chinese by widening their horizon. The benefit may be even 
greater to those whose conception is the same, or in certain respects 
the same, as Acheson¹s. 
What are Acheson¹s wild fabrications about modern Chinese history? 
First of all, he tries to explain the occurrence of the Chinese 
revolution in terms of economic and ideological conditions in China. 
Here he has recounted many myths. 
Acheson says: 
451

452 MAO TSE-TUNG 
The population of China during the eighteenth and nineteenth 
centuries doubled, thereby creating an unbearable pressure upon 
the land. The first problem which every Chinese Government 
has had to face is that of feeding this population. So far none 
has succeeded. The Kuomintang attempted to solve it by putting 
many land-reform laws on the statute books. Some of these 
laws have failed, others have been ignored. In no small measure, 
the predicament in which the National Government finds itself 
today is due to its failure to provide China with enough to eat. 
A large part of the Chinese Communists¹ propaganda consists of 
promises that they will solve the land problem. 
To those Chinese who do not reason clearly the above sounds 
plausible. Too many mouths, too little food, hence revolution. The 
Kuomintang has failed to solve this problem and it is unlikely that the 
Communist Party will be able to solve it either. ³So far none has 
succeeded.² 
Do revolutions arise from over-population? There have been 
many revolutions, ancient and modern, in China and abroad; were 
they all due to over-population? Were China¹s many revolutions in 
the past few thousand years also due to over-population? Was the 
American Revolution against Britain 174 years ago1 a lso due t o o verpopulation? 
Acheson¹s knowledge of history is nil. He has not 
even read the American Declaration of Independence. Washington, 
Jefferson and others made the revolution against Britain because of 
British oppression and exploitation of the Americans, and not because 
of any over-population in America. Each time the Chinese people 
overthrew a feudal dynasty it was because of the oppression and exploitation 
of the people by that feudal dynasty, and not because of 
any over-population. The Russians made the February Revolution 
and the October Revolution because of oppression and exploitation 
by the tsar and the Russian bourgeoisie, not because of any overpopulation, 
for to this day in Russia there is a great abundance of 
land as compared with people. In Mongolia, where the land is so 
vast and the population so sparse, a revolution would be inconceivable 
according to Acheson¹s line of reasoning, yet it took place 
some time ago.2 
According to Acheson, China has no way out at all. A population 
of 475 million constitutes an ³unbearable pressure² and, revolution 
or no revolution, the case is hopeless. Acheson pins great hope on

453 BANKRUPTCY OF IDEALIST CONCEPTION OF HISTORY 
this; although he has not voiced this hope, it has often been revealed 
by a number of American journalists ‹ through the allegation that the 
Communist Party of China will not be able to solve its economic problems, 
that China will remain in perpetual chaos and that her only way 
out is to live on U.S. flour, in other words, to become a U.S. colony. 
Why did the Revolution of 1911 not succeed and why did it not 
solve the problem of feeding the population? Because it overthrew 
only the Ching Dynasty but did not overthrow imperialist and feudal 
oppression and exploitation. 
Why did the Northern Expedition of 1926-27 not succeed and 
why did it not solve the problem of feeding the population? Because 
Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, surrendered to imperialism 
and became the chieftain of the counter-revolution which oppressed 
and exploited the Chinese. 
Is it true that ³so far none has succeeded²? In the old Liberated 
Areas in northwestern, northern, northeastern and eastern China, 
where the land problem has already been solved, does the problem of 
³feeding this population², as Acheson puts it, still exist? The United 
States has kept quite a number of spies or so-called observers in China. 
Why have they not ferreted out even this fact? In places like Shanghai, 
the problem of unemployment, or of feeding the population, arose 
solely because of cruel, heartless oppression and exploitation by 
imperialism, feudalism, bureaucrat-capitalism and the reactionary 
Kuomintang government. Under the People¹s Government, it will 
take only a few years for this problem of unemployment, or of feeding 
the population, to be solved as completely as in the northern, northeastern 
and other parts of the country. 
It is a very good thing that China has a big population. Even 
if China¹s population multiplies many times, she is fully capable of 
finding a solution; the solution is production. The absurd argument 
of Western bourgeois economists like Malthus3 that increases in food 
cannot keep pace with increases in population was not only thoroughly 
refuted in theory by Marxists long ago, but has also been completely 
exploded by the realities in the Soviet Union and the Liberated 
Areas of China after their revolutions. Basing itself on the truth 
that revolution plus production can solve the problem of feeding the 
population, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China 
has issued orders to Party organizations and the People¹s Liberation 
Army throughout the country not to dismiss but to retain all former 
Kuomintang personnel, provided they can make themselves useful

454 MAO TSE-TUNG 
and are not confirmed reactionaries or notorious scoundrels. Where 
things are very difficult, food and housing will be shared. Those who 
have been dismissed and have no means of support will be reinstated 
and provided with a living. According to the same principle, we 
shall maintain all Kuomintang soldiers who have revolted and come 
over to us or been captured. All reactionaries, except the major 
culprits, will be given a chance to earn their living, provided they show 
repentance. 
Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under 
the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, 
every kind of miracle can be performed. We are refuters of Acheson¹s 
counter-revolutionary theory. We believe that revolution can change 
everything, and that before long there will arise a new China with 
a big population and a great wealth of products, where life will be 
abundant and culture will flourish. All pessimistic views are utterly 
groundless. 
³The impact of the West² is given by Acheson as the second 
reason why the Chinese revolution occurred. Acheson says: 
For more than three thousand years the Chinese developed 
their own high culture and civilization, largely untouched by outside 
influences. Even when subjected to military conquest the 
Chinese always managed in the end to subdue and absorb the 
invader. It was natural therefore that they should come to look 
upon themselves as the center of the world and the highest 
expression of civilized mankind. Then in the middle of the 
nineteenth century the heretofore impervious wall of Chinese isolation 
was breached by the West. These outsiders brought with 
them aggressiveness, the unparalleled development of Western 
technology, and a high order of culture which had not accompanied 
previous foreign incursions into China. Partly because of 
these qualities and partly because of the decay of Manchu rule, 
the Westerners, instead of being absorbed by the Chinese, introduced 
new ideas which played an important part in stimulating 
ferment and unrest. 
To those Chinese who do not reason clearly, what Acheson says 
sounds plausible ‹ the influx of new ideas from the West gave rise 
to the revolution. 
Against whom was the revolution directed? Because there was 
³decay of Manchu rule² and because it is the weak point that is

455 BANKRUPTCY OF IDEALIST CONCEPTION OF HISTORY 
attacked, it would seem that the revolution was directed against the 
Ching Dynasty. But what Acheson says here is not quite right. The 
Revolution of 1911 was directed against imperialism. The Chinese 
directed the revolution against the Ching regime because it was the 
running dog of imperialism. The war against Britain¹s opium aggression, 
the war against the aggression of the Anglo-French allied forces, 
the war against the Ching regime, the running dog of imperialism, by 
the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom,4 the war against French aggression, 
the war against Japanese aggression and the war against the aggression 
of the allied forces of the eight powers - all ended in failure; hence 
the Revolution of 1911 broke out against the running dog of imperialism, 
the Ching Dynasty. That is modern Chinese history up to 
1911. What is the ³impact of the West², as Acheson calls it? It is 
the effort of the Western bourgeoisie, as Marx and Engels said in the 
Manifesto of the Communist Party o f 1848,5 to remould the world after 
its own image by means of terror. In the process of this impact or 
remoulding, the Western bourgeoisie, which needed compradors and 
flunkeys familiar with Western customs, had to let countries like China 
open schools and send students abroad, and thus ³new ideas were introduced² 
into China. Concurrently the national bourgeoisie and the 
proletariat were born in countries like China. At the same time, the 
peasantry was bankrupted, and a huge semi-proletariat was brought 
into existence. Thus the Western bourgeoisie created two categories 
of people in the East, a small minority, the flunkeys of imperialism, 
and a majority which is opposed to imperialism and consists of the 
working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the national 
bourgeoisie and the intellectuals coming from these classes. Those 
in the majority group are all grave-diggers of imperialism, who were 
created by imperialism itself, and the revolution originates from them. 
It was not that the so-called influx of ideas from the West stirred up 
³ferment and unrest², but that imperialist aggression provoked 
resistance. 
For a long time in the course of this resistance movement, that 
is, for over seventy years from the Opium War of 1840 to the eve of 
the May 4th Movement of 1919, the Chinese had no ideological weapon 
with which to defend themselves against imperialism. The ideological 
weapons of the old die-hard feudalism were defeated, had to 
give way and were declared bankrupt. Having no other choice, the 
Chinese were compelled to arm themselves with such ideological weapons 
and political formulas as the theory of evolution, the theory of

456 MAO TSE-TUNG 
natural rights and of the bourgeois republic, which were all borrowed 
from the arsenal of the revolutionary period of the bourgeoisie in the 
West, the native home of imperialism. The Chinese organized political 
parties and made revolutions, believing that they could thus resist 
foreign powers and build a republic. However, all these ideological 
weapons, like those of feudalism, proved very feeble and in their 
turn had to give way and were withdrawn and declared bankrupt. 
The Russian Revolution of 1917 awakened the Chinese, and they 
learned something new, Marxism-Leninism. In China, the Communist 
Party was born, an epoch-making event. Sun Yat-sen, too, 
advocated ³learning from Russia² and ³alliance with Russia and the 
Communist Party². In a word, from that time China changed her 
orientation. 
Being the spokesman of an imperialist government, Acheson naturally 
does not want to breathe even a word about imperialism. He 
describes imperialist aggression thus: ³These outsiders brought with 
them aggressiveness. . . .² ³Aggressiveness² ‹ what a beautiful name! 
Having learned this ³aggressiveness², the Chinese did not aggress 
into Britain or the United States but only created ³ferment and 
unrest² inside China, i.e., carried out revolutions against imperialism 
and its running dogs. But unfortunately they never once succeeded; 
each time, they were defeated by the imperialists, the inventors of 
³aggressiveness². The Chinese therefore turned around to learn 
something else and, strangely enough, they immediately found that 
it worked. 
The Chinese Communist Party ³had been organized in the early 
twenties under the ideological impetus of the Russian revolution². 
Here Acheson is right. This ideology was none other than Marxism- 
Leninism. This ideology is immeasurably superior to that of the 
Western bourgeoisie, which Acheson calls a ³high order of culture 
which had not accompanied previous foreign incursions into China². 
The clinching proof of the effectiveness of this ideology is that Western 
bourgeois culture, which the Achesons can boast of as a ³high order of 
culture² compared with China¹s old feudal culture, was defeated the 
moment it encountered the new Marxist-Leninist culture, the scientific 
world outlook and the theory of social revolution, which the Chinese 
people had acquired. In its first battle, this scientific and revolutionary 
new culture acquired by the Chinese people defeated the Northern 
warlords, the running dogs of imperialism; in the second, it defeated 
the attempts by another running dog of imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek,

457 BANKRUPTCY OF IDEALIST CONCEPTION OF HISTORY 
to intercept the Chinese Red Army during its 25,000-li Long March;6 
in the third, it defeated Japanese imperialism and its running dog, 
Wang Ching-wei; and in the fourth, it finally put an end to the domination 
of China by the United States and all other imperialist powers 
as well as to the rule of their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek and all 
the other reactionaries. 
The reason why Marxism-Leninism has played such a great role 
in China since its introduction is that China¹s social conditions call 
for it, that it has been linked with the actual practice of the Chinese 
people¹s revolution and that the Chinese people have grasped it. Any 
ideology ‹ even the very best, even Marxism-Leninism itself ‹ is ineffective 
unless it is linked with objective realities, meets objectively 
existing needs and has been grasped by the masses of the people. We 
are historical materialists, opposed to historical idealism. 
Oddly enough, ³Soviet doctrine and practice had a measurable 
effect upon the thinking and principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, particularly 
in terms of economics and Party organization². What was the effect 
produced on Dr. Sun by the ³high order of culture² of the West, of 
which Acheson and his like are so proud? Acheson doesn¹t say. 
Was it an accident that Dr. Sun, who devoted the greater part of his 
life to seeking from Western bourgeois culture the truth that would 
save the nation, was finally disappointed and turned to ³learning 
from Russia²? Obviously not. Of course it was no accident that 
Dr. Sun and the long suffering Chinese people he represented were 
all infuriated by the ³impact of the West² and resolved to form an 
³alliance with Russia and the Communist Party² in order to wage 
a life-and-death struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. 
Acheson dare not say here that the Soviet people are imperialist 
aggressors and that Sun Yat-sen learned from aggressors. Well, then, 
if Sun Yat-sen could learn from the Soviet people and the Soviet 
people are not imperialist aggressors, why can¹t his successors, the 
Chinese who live after him, learn from the Soviet people? Why are 
the Chinese, Sun Yat-sen excepted, described as ³dominated by the 
Soviet Union² and as ³the fifth column of the Comintern² and ³lackeys 
of Red imperialism² for learning the scientific world outlook and the 
theory of social revolution through Marxism-Leninism, linking these 
with China¹s specific characteristics, starting the Chinese People¹s War 
of Liberation and the great people¹s revolution and founding a republic 
of the people¹s democratic dictatorship? Can there be such superior 
logic anywhere in the world?

Since they learned Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people have 
ceased to be passive in spirit and gained the initiative. The period 
of modern world history in which the Chinese and Chinese culture 
were looked down upon should have ended from that moment. The 
great, victorious Chinese People¹s War of Liberation and the great 
people¹s revolution have rejuvenated and are rejuvenating the great 
culture of the Chinese people. In its spiritual aspect, this culture of the 
Chinese people already stands higher than any in the capitalist world. 
Take U.S. Secretary of State Acheson and his like, for instance. The 
level of their understanding of modern China and of the modern 
world is lower than that of an ordinary soldier of the Chinese People¹s 
Liberation Army. 
Up to this point, Acheson, like a bourgeois professor lecturing 
on a tedious text, has pretended to trace the causes and effects of 
events in China. Revolution occurred in China, first, because of 
over-population and, second, because of the stimulus of Western 
ideas. You see, he appears to be a champion of the theory of causation. 
But in what follows, even this bit of tedious and phoney theory 
of causation disappears, and one finds only a mass of inexplicable 
events. Quite unaccountably, the Chinese fought among themselves 
for power and money, suspecting and hating each other. An inexplicable 
change took place in the relative moral strength of the 
two contending parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; 
the morale of one party dropped sharply to below zero, while 
that of the other rose sharply to white heat. What was the reason? 
Nobody knows. Such is the logic inherent in the ³high order of 
culture² of the United States as represented by Dean Acheson.

2 In their struggle for liberation in 1921-24 the Mongolian people, under the leadership 
of the Mongolian People¹s Revolutionary Party, drove out the Russian Whiteguard 
bandit troops and the armed forces of the Northern warlords of China, both of which 
were backed by Japanese imperialism, overthrew Mongolian feudal rule and founded 
the Mongolian People¹s Republic. 
3 T. R. Malthus (1766-1834), Anglican clergyman and reactionary economist. In 
his Essay On Population (1798), he wrote that ³population unchecked . . . increases in

459 BANKRUPTCY OF IDEALIST CONCEPTION OF HISTORY 
geometrical ratio . . . [while] the means of subsistence . . . could not possibly be made 
to increase faster than in an arithmetical ratio². Basing himself on this arbitrary 
assumption, he came to the conclusion that all poverty and all evils in human society 
are permanent phenomena of nature. According to him, the only ways to solve the 
problem of poverty of the working people were to shorten their life-span, reduce the 
population or stop its increase. He regarded famine, pestilence and war as means 
to cut down population. 
4 The War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was a peasant revolutionary war 
waged against the feudal rule and national oppression of the Ching Dynasty in the 
middle of the 19th century. Hung Hsiu-chuan, Yang Hsiu-ching and others, the 
leaders of this revolution, staged an uprising in Kwangsi in January 1851 and proclaimed 
the founding of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. In 1852 the peasant army 
proceeded northward from Kwangsi and marched through Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi 
and Anhwei and in 1853 it captured Nanking, the main city on the lower Yangtse. 
Part of its forces then continued the drive north and pushed to the vicinity of Tientsin, 
a major city in northern China. Because the Taiping army failed to build stable 
base areas in the places it occupied and also because, after establishing its capital in 
Nanking, the leading group in the army committed many political and military errors, 
it could not withstand the joint attack of the counter-revolutionary troops of the 
Ching government and the aggressors, Britain, the United States and France, and 
suffered defeat in 1864. 
5 See Manifesto of the Communist Party, Chapter I, ³Bourgeois and Proletarians². 
The bourgeoisie ³compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois 
mode of production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their 
midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its 
own image². 
6 In October 1934 the First, Third and Fifth Army Groups of the Chinese Workers¹ 
and Peasants¹ Red Army (that is, the First Front Army of the Red Army, also known 
as the Central Red Army) set out from Changting and Ninghua in western Fukien 
and from Juichin, Yutu and other places in southern Kiangsi and started a major 
strategic movement. In traversing the eleven provinces of Fukien, Kiangsi, Kwangtung, 
Hunan, Kwangsi, Kweichow, Szechuan, Yunnan, Sikang, Kansu and Shensi, 
crossing perpetually snow-capped mountains and trackless grasslands, sustaining untold 
hardships and frustrating the enemy¹s repeated encirclements, pursuits, obstructions 
and interceptions, the Red Army covered 25,000 li (12,500 kilometres) on this march 
and finally arrived triumphantly at the revolutionary base area in northern Shensi in 
October 1935.
