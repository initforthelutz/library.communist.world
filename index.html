"With the master what is new and significant develops vigorously amid the 'manure' of contradictions out of the contradictory phenomena. The underlying contradictions themselves testify to the richness of the living foundation from which the theory itself developed. It is different with the disciple. His raw material is no longer reality, but the new theoretical form in which the master has sublimated it. It is in part the <I>theoretical disagreement of opponents of the new theory</I> and in part the <I>often paradoxical relationship of this theory to reality</I> which drive him to seek <I>to refute</I> his opponents and <I>explain away</I> reality. In doing so, he entangles himself in contradictions and with his attempts to solve these he demonstrates the beginning <I>disintegration of  the theory</I> which he dogmatically espouses." &nbsp; (Karl Marx)<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

"The fight against 'revisionism' cannot be waged by conserving, or rather, by merely reappropriating, Marxism as it existed historically in the previous period. Far from being the signal for a return to the supposed orthodoxy of the preceding epoch, the appearance of a 'revisionism' is a symptom of the need for Marxism to criticize itself." &nbsp; (G. Madjarian)</FONT></B>

(This offers a shot-gun approach by searching the entire site. It may prove useful to those who are relatively unfamiliar with the material. However, as with any search facility, the more you can narrow the focus of your searches, the more rapidly will the search be executed, and the less likely will you be flooded with results which are only marginal to your topic of interest. Unless you are disperate, you'll be better off using the search engines specifically configured for, and available in, each of the "collections".)
