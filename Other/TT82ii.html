     The period from August 1943, when Vukmanovic-Tempo departed, until August 1944, when Velimir Stojnic arrived, is one of the stormiest and most brilliant periods in the history of our Party and the National Liberation War in Albania. During this time our Communist Party further 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 130</B></FONT><P>

increased and tempered its ranks, worked out and consistently followed a clear and correct Marxist-Leninist line in all the fields and, as a result, great victories were achieved. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The strengthening and consolidation of the Anti-fascist National Liberation Front, the organization and strengthening of national liberation councils in villages and cities constitute further evidence of the colossal work and struggle which our Party carried out in that period. The 2nd National Liberation Conference held in Labinot of Elbasan in September 1943 and its very important decisions<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp130">1</A>]</FONT> set the course for all the great and far-sighted work of the Party for the creation of the new state of people's democracy in Albania. The crowning of this work was the organization and holding of the historic Congress of P&euml;rmet with complete success in May 1944, a congress which finally accomplished one of the strategic tasks of the Party -- the creation of the new Albanian state of people's democracy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     During this period, in ceaseless clashes with the occupier and the local traitors, the Albanian National Liberation Army rapidly increased its ranks, was armed and tempered in battle, and affirmed itself as an army of the new type. Apart from other things, it successfully withstood one of the heaviest blows of the enemy -- the great nazi Winter Operation of 1943-1944, and in the spring of 1944, on the orders of the General Staff it seized the initiative and launched a counter-offensive. After the creation of a considerable number

This conference dealt with the strengthening of the democratic people's power as a fundamental question. It approved the Constitution and the rules of the national liberation councils, elected the new National Liberation General Council, publicly denounced the compromise the representatives of the General Council, Ymer Dishnica and Mustafa Gjinishi (secret agent of the British Intelligence Service -- see: Enver Hoxha, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Anglo-American Threat to Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Tirana 1982, pp. 173-224, Eng. ed.) had reached with the representatives of the Balli Komb&euml;tar in Mukje, Kruja district, in opposition to the instructions they had received, and decided on the thorough exposure of the hostile activity of the Balli Komb&euml;tar.

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 131</B></FONT><P>

of brigades and other units, which in May 1944 included more than 35 000 fighters in their ranks, apart from the territorial &ccedil;etas and the armed volunteers in the villages, we went on to the formation of the 1st Shock Division and, a little later, of the 2nd Shock Division of the ANLA. At the end of May 1944 as Commander-in-Chief, I issued the order to the National Liberation Army to launch a general offensive for the complete liberation of Albania from the German occupiers and for the total destruction of the Balli Komb&euml;tar and the Legaliteti and all the other forces of reaction. The flames of the decisive battle swept Albania from south to north. Everything was going well, both on the external front against the Hitlerite forces and on the internal front. The decisive victory was not far off. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Precisely at this period, the efforts and attempts of the Anglo-American allies to interfere savagely in our internal affairs<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT>, to prevent Albania slipping from their fingers were intensified as never before. However, we defeated these plans of the allies in time. In the future, too; we were to display unrelenting vigilance and care to neutralize the Anglo-American threat. We were to have struggles and battles with them, but in the final analysis, their cause in Albania was lost. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Precisely at these moments when the storm of the war and the revolution in Albania had reached its climax, Tito's emissary Colonel Velimir Stojnic and his aide Nijaz Dizdarevic<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> arrived at our General Staff. Their arrival marked the beginning of one of the most difficult and delicate periods of our wartime and post-war history --  the period of open and secret clashes and conflicts with the Belgrade leadership.

Where this Velimir Stojnic has ended up today we do not know, and we have never heard his name again after the notorious activity he carried on in Albania, while Nijaz Dizdarevic, after being a bow-tied diplomat in Paris, later an ambassador with a string of tranquillity beads in Algeria, was lately chairman of the Foreign Affairs Commission in the Yugoslav Federal Skupstina.

Thus, for several years on end, the CPA and the Albanian people were to be involved in a new, peculiar war, without artillery and machine-guns, but just as difficult, if not more so, and with more dangerous consequences than the war with weapons against the open enemies.

The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>
</B>

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    Velimir Stojnic came to Albania in the end of August 1944 as chief of the Yugoslav military mission attached to our General Staff. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The task of our mission,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he told us at the first meeting in Helm&euml;s, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>is, first, to transmit in a fraternal way to your General Staff the experience of the Yugoslav Staff in connection with big combined operations now that the German troops are withdrawing from Greece; second, to establish regular liaison between the general staffs and armies of our two countries, to examine the possibilities to co-ordinate our actions in large-scale joint operations in the future, and third, to assist in the further organization of the sister army of Albania.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
           Very quickly, however, from the first conversation with this colonel and his main aide Nijaz Dizdarevic, we were to become convinced that their mission was military only in name, in its label and method of operation. Indeed, at the first meeting Stojnic himself told us that he had come also as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>instructor of the CC of the CPY<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> attached to our leadership, but we did not accept him in this capacity and he quite openly expressed his annoyance. The truth is that he came for other <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>duties<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Some of them, those most obvious and which, with the level of our knowledge at those moments, we could recognize most readily, we were to understand at that time. The others were to become clear later, when we went back again and again over all those things which 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 133</B></FONT><P>

occurred from the moment the Stojnic team arrived in Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Time was to prove that, above all, the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was a special mission which was sent by Tito to Albania at the end of the war for sinister political aims, for sabotage and espionage. It came to organize the attack on the CPA and its line, to subjugate the CPA, to turn it into a tool and appendage of the CPY. It came precisely on the eve of the complete liberation of Albania in order to attack the foundations on which the new people's state power was being erected, and to prepare the terrain for turning Albania into the 7th Republic of Yugoslavia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On account of the special relations we had created with the CPY, we welcomed the new emissary of the Yugoslav leadership warmly and whole-heartedly. He told us about the situation in Yugoslavia, the partisan war and the successes achieved under the leadership of the CPY and Tito. And we, too, at the first meeting, told him in a comradely way about the situation and successes of our army, about the Front and the new people's state power which was being set up. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Some other day,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I can also tell you about the organization and experience of our Communist Party.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shall be very pleased to hear these things,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Ours is a young party and we need to know the experience of older and bigger parties and to exchange opinions.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     So, at another meeting, Velimir Stojnic talked to us about the CPY, about its past, as well as about the war and the correct development which it assumed once Josip Broz Tito came to the leadership, and the great authority which the party had won among the people through the heroic war towards victory it was waging under his leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On this occasion, I, too, spoke about the history of our Party from its founding, about how it had extended and the successes it had achieved, etc., etc. As soon as I finished, the colonel threw off his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>military<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> role and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In fact, my main mission is military, but as a party cadre and on the special instruction of the leadership of our 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 134</B></FONT><P>

party, I shall also talk about party matters and everything else,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and assuming a very serious air, he began to make <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of us over our line and to list the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mistakes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which our Party had allegedly committed <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>continually<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     One of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>main<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> criticisms which Velimir Stojnic had brought was the allegation that the line of our Party had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>continually<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> vacillated from right to left, and he did not fail to link the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of our line with the criticisms of Vukmanovic-Tempo. In fact, Tempo had advocated fratricidal war, had advised us to attack the newly emerged Balli Komb&euml;tar and had criticized the efforts of our Party to win misled elements away from the Balli Komb&euml;tar. For his part, Velimir Stojnic accused us of opportunism in our line and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proved<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> this with the fact that representatives of the General Council of the National Liberation Front held talks with representatives of the Balli Komb&euml;tar in the Mukje village near Kruja at the end of July and the beginning of August 1943. At the same time, while describing Mukje as an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunist act<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, using the same <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>argument<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, he reproached us for being sectarian, because we had not continued the talks with these collaborators with Italian fascism and traitors to our people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After listening quietly to this person (whom at that time we considered at least ill-informed about our line), I said to him: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Not only are you in contradiction with yourself and with Tempo, but you force me to the conclusion that you don't know the situation in our country. You have to understand that the Balli Komb&euml;tar is the front of betrayal, its chiefs are collaborators with the Italian fascists. From the moment that the Balli Komb&euml;tar was formed our Party appealed to its members to unite against the occupiers. This was not opportunism in our line, but a correct application of the line. The Balli Komb&euml;tar fought us and collaborated with the Italian occupiers. On the eve of the capitulation of Italy new situations were being created in our war, and we had to take advantage of them. To this end, we appealed 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 135</B></FONT><P>

once again to the members of the Balli Komb&euml;tar to join in the war, both against the Italian occupiers who were on the verge of capitulation, and against the new German occupiers. The chiefs of the Balli Komb&euml;tar responded to our call to hold talks and to decide what should be done later. We had our objectives and they had theirs. They came to the talks with us to gain a little credit after the great discredit they had suffered among the people, while, as I said, we set out with the aim of drawing the Balli Komb&euml;tar into the war against the new occupiers, the savage German nazis. If the chiefs of the Balli Komb&euml;tar were to continue to play their old game this time, too, then they would be more thoroughly and finally exposed in the eyes of the people and would be abandoned by the misled elements who comprised the base of that organization. That is why the Mukje Meeting was held. The delegates of our National Liberation Front had been clearly instructed that they were going to Mukje to tell the Balli Komb&euml;tar to join in the war and that beyond this no compromise could be made with them. The chiefs of the Balli Komb&euml;tar had their own plans at Mukje. They not only wanted to create a joint committee, but also wanted parity in the leadership of the Albania of the future. Those who demanded this were those who had collaborated openly with fascist Italy, and they demanded this at a time when they gave no guarantee that they would fight against the Germans and when, amongst other things, they wanted us to accept the thesis of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>greater Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>ethnic Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. And the two delegates of our Party fell for the Balli Komb&euml;tar's trap and accepted its demands, because one of them, Mustafa Gjinishi, as it is emerging, was an agent of the British Intelligence Service, and the other, Ymer Dishnica, was an opportunist. Immediately the Party learned of this betrayal by its delegates, it denounced it. Therefore, Comrade Velimir, I tell you that your criticisms of our Party and its leadership either of opportunism or of sectarianism are without foundation.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I insist that your condemnation of Mukje was sectarian- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 136</B></FONT><P>

ism,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> repeated Velimir. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You should have found the language to persuade the chiefs of the Balli Komb&euml;tar.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Never! That would have been betrayal, betrayal of the Party,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Miladin very angrily. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Had we done that the Albanian people ought to have lined us up against the wall and shot us. Why did this people and this Party fight? To share power with reaction?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The debate flared up and went on for a long time. Velimir, Miladin and I did most of the speaking. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe sat completely silent, but according to the argument, sometimes went red and sometimes pale, while Nako Spiru had no <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chance<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to engage in the debate: his knowledge of Italian had tied him up with number 2 in the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, with the clever and cunning Yugoslav Nijaz Dizdarevic, to whom he translated what we said. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I do not say you should share power,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Stojnic replied indignantly to Miladin Popovic. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You ought to have taken part in the meetings envisaged at Mukje, this is what I want to say. Don't try to conceal your sectarianism. It is blatant!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In what do you see it?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In what I said about the way you acted with regard to Mukje. But I have other facts, too. Liri Gega and Mehmet Shehu have made your sectarianism obvious. By what name shall we call what they are doing?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They have their own faults and we have criticized them for these things and we shall look into them more deeply. But don't forget that their close collaborator, indeed, their inspirer in all their distortions and sectarian acts, has been your comrade. Dusan Mugosa.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Leave Mugosa out of this,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interrupted Stojnic, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>he belongs to us and we shall look into his work. I am referring to your comrades. In Vlora Liri Gega appoints and removes whoever she likes in the regional committee and the command.

     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You seem to be well-acquainted with our-situation!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said with obvious sarcasm. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 137</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I believe I am! Indeed, I know it very well!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Velimir Stojnic arrogantly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade colonel!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I put in in a stern tone there and then. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are friends and comrades, we respect and honour your party and fraternal people, but excuse me, it seems to me you are going beyond your military authority, either as a delegate of the Yugoslav General Staff or as a member of another party. Your interference in our affairs is out of place and your tone is unacceptable.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are communists, first of all,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said backing down a little. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There is nothing wrong with our talking about these questions. I told you that I have special instructions from Comrade Tito to talk with you about these matters, too.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>All right,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we can talk as communists, but bear in mind where you are speaking and why.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I beg your pardon,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied, blushing: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Perhaps I used some ill-considered expression, but you must understand, I say everything in a comradely way, for your benefit, because we are friends. I have no other aim. But let us leave this for today, we'll talk about it more calmly another time.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We parted coldly although we smiled and shook hands. However, I could not get what had occurred out of my mind, especially the unexpected accusation of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. A year earlier we had made efforts to win the nationalist elements and anyone else to the course of the war against the occupier and for this Tempo accused us of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, while now, when we had put the Balli Komb&euml;tar firmly in its place, it emerges that we had fallen into <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. This was intolerable and I said to Miladin: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't understand this. Do these delegates want to help us or do they want 'to catch' us, or saddle us with a 'mistake' at all costs. . . ?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Miladin forced a smile, slapped me on the shoulder and said nothing. It was a smile which I had rarely seen on the face of my comrade-in-arms and in hardships. In that smile there was despair, regret, and perhaps also suspicion about what the comrades of his Party were pouring out. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 138</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us fight, let us fight and forge ahead,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and these matters will be cleared up. After all, Tempo and Velo [Velimir Stojnic] and the devil knows who else are neither the CPY, nor the CC of the CPY.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I wouldn't want to put that in doubt,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Those were days full of work, tension and most difficult and varied problems which demanded correct and urgent solutions. During those days and nights, the comrades and I devoted a great part of our time and strength to preparing the strategic and operational plans for the battles which the divisions and other big and small units of our army were waging, or that we planned for them to wage in the general offensive which had been launched. The major problems in the life of the Party, in the army and amongst the civilian population, the problems of the Front and the national liberation councils demanded time and effort from us. Moreover, at the Congress of P&euml;rmet we had formed the Anti-fascist National Liberation Committee which performed the functions of the Democratic Government, and the most important thing was that this government was not just a creation on paper or a group of people who had to sit waiting for the day when they would take power. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     No, we were a government in action, a government which had power over most of Albania and from day to day this power was being extended to the towns, villages and regions which were liberated. On some other occasion I shall relate in detail what an endless field of complex problems was this of the creation, organization and running of the state and what efforts, work, studies and debates we had to carry out. I want to stress only that the situation, the phase which our war had reached, and a series of other circumstances compelled us to think of and be responsible for everything -- from the major problems of the final battle for liberation, from ensuring food and shelter for the population of the liberated zones, and indeed, even unliberated zones, from the organization of the first work of construction to the taking of preliminary measures for the phase when the Party and the people 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 139</B></FONT><P>

would have the whole of Albania free and democratic. In our way, we had the Anglo-American allies, who, like experienced political gamblers, played new cards day after day to lead us up a blind alley, and around us we had internal reaction which saw that it was losing its case and tried to create a thousand obstacles and difficulties for us. Add to this the lack of experience of nearly all of us in the problems of the organization and running of a new state, add the marked lack of cadres, and the picture becomes more or less clear. And precisely in the midst of all this work, with its endless series of difficulties and cardinal, great and little problems, the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> is sent amongst us with its predetermined objectives and aims. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the first days of September we had gone down to Odri&ccedil;an (Helm&euml;s with its few houses could not shelter all of us), and from there through many ceaseless contacts we led the whole country. The telephone never stopped ringing, radio messages came from all directions, the coming and going of couriers and comrades was uninterrupted. Sometimes, Velimir Stojnic came, too, for a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>consultation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>assistance<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or simply to say <I>dobar dan.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp139">*</A>]</FONT> He tried to learn everything and poked his nose everywhere. At one moment, when I was exchanging a couple of words with him in passing, the signals officer came to me and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Commander! They report from Gjirokastra that they are going to blow up the Dragot Bridge. German convoys are approaching from the Drino and the Vjosa gorges, and the Dragot Bridge is a key point. They want your opinion.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In no way!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Transmit the order immediately not to blow up the Dragot Bridge, but to defend it at all costs.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Where is this bridge?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> asked Velimir Stojnic all interest immediately. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I went up to the map and pointed it out to him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why shouldn't it be blown up?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he exploded as if a

wasp had stung him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It's an extremely strategic bridge. If the German columns cross it that will open up a lot of trouble for you and also for us. Let the Germans be cut up and wiped out on the other side, otherwise they'll penetrate all through Albania and even into Yugoslavia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't worry,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our order is that between Kakavia and Hani i Hotit<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp140">1</A>]</FONT> no German is to be left alive. And if some are left we shall pursue them, hot foot, over our borders.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then, why not destroy this bridge?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he asked again. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Blowing it up would greatly hinder their penetration. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Because the time has come when we need the bridges. A good many of them have been and are being blown up by the Germans and the officers of the British missions are astoundingly zealous about blowing up many others. But now that our military forces have all our roads and gorges and mountains under control, to blow up the bridge means to blow up the property of the people in power. You don't realize that the Dragot Bridge is a strategic point for our operations. As to stopping the enemy columns, I must tell you that the K&euml;lcyra Gorge is near the bridge and our forces have made it impassable for the Germans.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The chief of the Yugoslav military mission went away displeased. As I said, in fact military problems were not his main mission. But in this aspect, too, those who had sent him had charged him with tasks. One of these was to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>influence<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us so that during this period we would engage the maximum number of German units which were deployed in Albania, or those withdrawing from Greece, in battle on our territory, and hence, not permit the penetration of nazi forces into Yugoslavia As we heard later, on the orders of the Yugoslav General Staff, they had formed a strong defensive curtain on the borders between Greece and Macedonia,

Respectively the south-easternmost and north-westernmost extension of the border of Albania. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 141</B></FONT><P>

with the aim of preventing the withdrawal of the Germans in that strategic direction. Thus, Albania remained the only <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>door<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for their withdrawal. Hence, through this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>division of doors<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the mortally wounded nazi beast was to pour its final ferocity on our territories and forces. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, it had never crossed our minds that such a division of roles could be made during the war. We had always fought with all our might and possibilities to kill every nazi wherever we found him, without ever considering that we could make an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advantageous tactical withdrawal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> into some safe spot in order to leave the enemy to be wiped out by somebody else. All the battles we had waged up till August 1944 had proved this; it was proved to the best, also, by the heroic and uninterrupted fighting of our forces from August to November 1944 and, after the liberation of Albania, by the fact that a good part of these forces continued the hot pursuit of the nazis beyond our state borders into Yugoslavia. In short, for this part of his mission Velimir Stojnic had to exert no effort. He was left free to concentrate on other, more important aspects. And as I said, he began this work as soon as he set foot in Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     How did Velimir Stojnic and his associates begin their work? They divided their roles. Velimir posed as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>competent<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> on the organization of the army, the party, the state, the security service, education, culture, etc. In a word, he was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a great brain<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and it was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a great favour<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia did our Party by sending such a man to give us <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>experience<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For his part, Nijaz Dizdarevic was a real fox; clever, but evil and a dyed-in-the-wool intriguer. The things he knew, he knew thoroughly and expressed well. He had been charged to work with our youth and to organize them in resistance against the Party, if it opposed the implementation of the diabolical plans of the Yugoslavs. Nijaz Dizdarevic not only became the <I>&eacute;minence grise </I>* of Nako Spiru, but 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 142</B></FONT><P>

he also played on people's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>heart strings<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the interests of the Yugoslav UDB. During the plot, he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>fell in love<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with a member of the plenum of the Central Committee of our Party, promised to marry her and, when he had gathered all the information he needed, cleared off and left her. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      A few days before the arrival of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, a Soviet major, Ivanov, had also come to Helm&euml;s. As can be imagined, we welcomed him with open arms and with all the honours befitting the representative of the glorious army of Stalin. But it was regrettable that Major Ivanov should represent such an army as the Red Army. He was a clever, cunning type, and as became apparent later, he, too, had come on a military mission, as well as on other <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>special<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> missions. I well remember how he sat the whole day near the stairs waiting for Colonel Stojnic, and the fact is that Ivanov was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>informed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about Albania and us, its fighters, in the light in which Stojnic described us. Regrettably the Soviet Union was being informed about Albania through the eyes of Stojnic, and not only on the eve of liberation, but also for several years afterwards the Soviets were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>acquainted<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with us through the tales that Tito, Kardelj, Djilas and others concocted. At every opportunity Major Ivanov continually boosted Velimir Stojnic and Nijaz Dizdarevic to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>convince<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the two Yugoslav comrades have capacity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. In reality, however, Velimir Stojnic was a young ass, a very ordinary person, who had learned a few formulas by rote and could speak only about them, apart from the instructions which they had given him and which he would draw from his briefcase and quote time after time. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The first arguments they had with us, especially the clear-cut objections which Miladin and I raised, completely convinced Velimir Stojnic and Nijaz Dizdarevic that they must set to work at once to bring about radical changes. Velimir Stojnic worked persistently to build up a tense situation. He communicated every day by radio with Tito's 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 143</B></FONT><P>

staff, especially with its organizational secretary -- Rankovic, wherefrom he received instructions about how he should act. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When he saw that Miladin, as a Yugoslav, did not support them in the criticisms they made, but, on the contrary, opposed them, he sought to remove him from the scene and to isolate me from the comrades in order to attack me more easily. And this is what he did. We were still at Odri&ccedil;an when he managed to get rid of Miladin. He passed on to him Tito's order that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Miladin should return as quickly as possible to Yugoslavia and present himself to report<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. The villainy of the Velimir Stojnic group went so far that they did not inform me even <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in a comradely way<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about this decision which was taken about a comrade who had worked three or four years with us and had fought together with us. They had instructed Miladin that, when he talked with me about his departure, he must not tell me that they had summoned him to report, but simply that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>they were sending him to work on another task in Yugoslavia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At first, to avoid upsetting me, he did not tell me the truth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But why precisely at these moments?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Just a few more weeks and Albania will be liberated. Let us enter Tirana together once more, not illegally, with bombs and pistols in our pockets, as in 1941 and 1942, but freely, as victors, then you can go. I'll gather the people and say to them: 'You see this chap. He is a Montenegrin, a Yugoslav. But he is ours, he's an Albanian, too. His name is Miladin Popovic, we call him Ali Gostivari. He is our comrade, our brother, a communist who for four years on end, together with us and with you, fought and made sacrifices, grew up with us, and gave everything he had for this victory, for freedom. Now he is going away. All of you should kiss him and wish him good-bye!'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> As I said this Ali Gostivari wept. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Listen,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you have to stay a few more weeks to see freedom!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 144</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I want to so badly, Enver, but. . . I have to go. This is the order from my centre.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I sensed that he was hiding something from me. I met Stojnic and asked him in the name of our leadership to intervene with his leadership to postpone the order. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That cannot be done,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Velimir Stojnic, cold and inexorable. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito issues an order only once.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very well,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but how, by what route, is he to go to Yugoslavia?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Over the mountains,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are still at war.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we shall not allow this. In 1942 and 1943, when we were illegal, we picked up Blazo and Tempo and sent them on their way by car, when they were fit and well, and we cannot fail to do the same thing for Miladin now that we are almost liberated. You know that he is ill with tuberculosis.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But what can we do?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he asked, and added, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I know only this: he must leave as quickly as possible for Yugoslavia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      A plan came to my mind and I sought an urgent meeting with one of the officers of the British Mission. It was the time when the British wanted to be on <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>good terms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with us, so that we would approve their repeated <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>variants<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of a landing<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT>. At that time we had also reached an agreement with them for a number of seriously wounded partisans to be treated in the allied hospitals in Bari of Italy. The British officer presented himself in the room where I worked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Mister officer,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I want to ask a confidential favour from you.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      He forgot he was a military man and bowed from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>satisfaction<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that I was giving him the opportunity to do me such a favour. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>A partisan, a close friend of mine, is very ill. Could you use your possibilities to transport him as quickly as possible to Bari?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Of course, tomorrow evening!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied the British

officer very <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>readily<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you have given me the opportunity, General, to tell you that I want to discuss something with you.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I had taken into account that I would have to pay <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the reckoning<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The day after tomorrow, in the morning,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I agreed there and then. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>All right!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the British officer clicked his heels together and left. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I met Miladin and Stojnic and said to the latter: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Tomorrow evening we are going to send Miladin to Bari under his Albanian name Ali Gostivari. Get in touch with your staff so that they take measures for the Yugoslav representatives attached to the Allied Command in Italy to meet him. From there I believe room will be found for Miladin Popovic in one of the ships or aircraft which link your staff with the Allied Command every day.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Velimir Stojnic's face darkened with anger that this matter had been settled so neatly, but he had no way to oppose it. We parted. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Before he left, Miladin was strolling thoughtfully. I caught up with him and when we were approaching the church square in Odri&ccedil;an he put his arm round my shoulders and said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Enver, I didn't tell you yesterday because I didn't want to add to your distress, but you ought to know. I'm going because I'm forced to do so in Tito's name. They're not pleased with my work. But I tell you one thing: this Velimir Stojnic and Nijaz Dizdarevic are behaving like enemies. Watch out for them! I only hope that I reach Yugoslavia alive and I'm able to meet Tito, because I'm not going to keep quiet and let them go undenounced.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     So they removed Miladin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Immediately after we farewelled him, I summoned Velimir Stojnic to my office, and asked him the reason for Miladin's departure. He said coldly: 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 176</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It was an order from Tito that he should return to Yugoslavia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I trust,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that Tito has not ordered that this decision about a comrade who worked in these difficult years together with our Party should not be communicated to me.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Has Miladin informed you about this?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He informed me, but it was up to you to do such a thing,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said coldly and asked: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why was Miladin summoned to Yugoslavia?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>To render account,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied in an arrogant tone. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't object to his going or to his rendering account about his work to the CC of the CPY,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but I should have been informed. If it is simply a question of 'rendering account',<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Miladin ought first to render account to our Party, where he worked. And I tell you that he worked very well, as an internationalist communist, while you have not acted correctly. This is my view.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You stick to your view and we shall stick to ours,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Velimir Stojnic and we parted, shaking hands coldly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After this the second step of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> began. I was left as the focal point of the attack. Of course, I did not know and those days I did not even realize what was being prepared and hatched up around me, but I could not fail to be aware of the cold atmosphere that was being created. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the last days of our stay at Odri&ccedil;an, Velimir Stojnic came to my office and said to me in a serious tone: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade General Secretary. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I understood that he had come on <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>party matters<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> because he had adopted certain <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>special<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> rules of protocol in his relations with us: when he came on military matters he began with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Commander<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, when he came on <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>state matters<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he began with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Chairman<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, when he came on party affairs he began with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade General Secretary<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Recently we have had a number of discussions but have 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 147</B></FONT><P>

not carried them through to the finish. I think that we ought to go into them thoroughly,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When the opportunity and possibilities present themselves,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You realize how busy we are.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I see that,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but I consider this necessary. These questions are important for your line, for all your work.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very well,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As soon as I find the opportunity I shall inform you.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, no. I think we should go into them extensively in the Bureau of your Central Committee. Indeed, I find it regrettable that up till now you have not summoned the Bureau to hear me officially.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Bureau, Comrade Stojnic,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>meets according to the plan of work it has, according to the problems and conditions which present themselves to us. But I telI you sincerely I have not considered and do not consider it reasonable to summon the Bureau over those matters which you raise.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This ought to have been done long ago,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said in a stern and offended tone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As far as I know you are soon to hold a meeting of the Bureau. The comrades have been assembled and indeed I was introduced to Liri Gega who had just arrived from the North.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is quite true that we have a meeting of the Bureau,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but it is a meeting of the Bureau of the Central Committee of our Party and I tell you frankly that your request to take part in it is out of place and unacceptable.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Do you mean to say that you are still against my taking part in it?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You should not even make such requests, which are contrary to the norms of an independent party, irrespective of our fraternal relations.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As he stared at me for quite a pause, without speaking. I saw an expression of internal anger and a cynical smile. Then he muttered something and stalked out. What this smile implied I understood as soon as we had begun the meeting of our Political Bureau. We had decided that at this 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 148</B></FONT><P>

meeting we would analyse the more urgent problems of the situation, decide on the work plan of the Bureau for the period up till the liberation of Albania, and the main item, I was to present the main theses of the report which we were to make to the coming plenum of the CC of the Party. Those present at the meeting were Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Nako Spiru, Ramadan (&Ccedil;itaku, Liri Gega and I (two other former members of the Bureau, Ymer Dishnica and Gjin Marku, elected at the 1st National Conference in March 1943, had been expelled from the Political Bureau and the Central Committee of the Party some time earlier: Ymer Dishnica for the betrayal he had committed at Mukje with the Balli Komb&euml;tar in August 1943, and Gjin Marku for his almost complete failure to take part in the meetings of the Political Bureau as well as for his notorious compromise with the Germans in Berat in the autumn of 1943).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp148">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As soon as we began the meeting of the Political Bureau, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe got up and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I propose we should invite the delegate of the Yugoslav leadership, Comrade Stojnic, to take part in this meeting.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku and I, and at first Liri Gega, too, totally opposed this. Nako Spiru was in solidarity with Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. The meeting of the Bureau about the most important current and future problems suddenly became a battle of words: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He is chief of the military mission,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>why should he come to the Bureau?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He is the representative of a sister army and a sister party!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> put in Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then let us call Ivanov, too,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Indeed, accord-

In September-October 1943, Gjin Marku, commander of the partisan forces of the Berat region, without notifying the General Staff and contravening the line of the CPA, allowed the German forces to enter freely into Berat which was already liberated by the forces of the National Liberation Army. This act without precedent in Albania was condemned by the Party as a very serious fault. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 149</B></FONT><P>

ing to this logic,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I added sarcastically, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we should even invite the Englishman as an observer, he is our ally. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Tempers blazed and this was completely unexpected and astonishing to me. Never before had such a scene occurred Since we were failing to agree, it was proposed to put the matter to the vote. Unexpectedly Liri Gega raised her hand together with Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako Spiru. Ramadan &cCedil;itaku and I were left in the minority. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this way Velimir Stojnic was given the right to take part, discuss and dictate his will in our Political Bureau. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From these moments begins one of the most unpleasant and gravest processes in the life of our Party, the process of the splitting of our Political Bureau, of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reorganizations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of it and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>co-options<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to it, and later, of upsetting the whole Central Committee elected in Labinot in March 1943. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     To achieve these results Velimir Stojnic had to work carefully, according to a well thought-out plan. As I said, as soon as he arrived in Albania, he began to apply his plan, but it was only in that meeting of the Political Bureau that for the first time I felt that something serious was going on when the place of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>honoured guest<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was given to Velimir by vote. Immediately after I ended my main contribution, in which I put before the comrades the theses of the report which I was to prepare for the 2nd Plenum of the CC, Stojnic with a certain <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>politeness<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> sought the right to speak. In a few words he thanked us for the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>honour<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which we did him and the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>trust<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which our Bureau expressed in him by inviting him to this meeting and immediately opened his brief case: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>From what the Comrade General Secretary said, I realize that this is a very important meeting. By coincidence (!) the things I want to say to you in a fraternal way are completely in conformity with the theme of this meeting, which is to discuss the problems you are going to put before the plenum of your Central Committee.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Everything he said in the course of a good two hours (apart from the time required for the translations consisted in essence of theses which completely overturned all that I had 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 150</B></FONT><P>

presented in my opening contribution. In other words, his theses were a complete overturning of the line followed and victories achieved by our Party and at the same time, if they were accepted, were a completely distorted platform for the future. In essence they comprised: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      First, a euphoric propaganda of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the majestic successes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the CPY and Tito. He praised Tito to the skies, almost putting him on the same footing as Stalin, and openly implying that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Albanians and the Bulgarians are triumphing in the war<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> thanks to the great aid of the Yugoslavs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Immediately after eulogizing Tito, the CPY and their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>brilliant<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>creative<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> line, etc., Stojnic repeated bluntly and brutally all those things that we had learnt by heart: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You have not had a clear line<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you have suffered from sectarianism, opportunism and sectarianism again<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      With these theses Velimir Stojnic aimed to attack the line of our Party throughout the period of the war and to present it as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unstable, unclear and, especially, sectarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Second, although the meeting was dedicated to the results of our war, Stojnic passed over this with the odd phrase, indeed in a disdainful tone, and poured out praise solely for the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>experience<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>example<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>outstanding and great contribution<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav army. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      With such boastful propaganda about their war, Velimir Stojnic aimed to create the impression that our National Liberation War <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was nothing very much<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was not of any great weight in comparison with the war of the peoples of Yugoslavia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. With this he openly implied that we were indebted to the Yugoslav war for our liberation, and he worked in this direction to create the view that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our war was simply a war of &ccedil;etas<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, or even worse, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a war of terrorists and assassins<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Hence, he pulled out of his briefcase the old hostile theses of Vukmanovic-Tempo with whom I had always been in open opposition and dispute. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Third, the line of the Party in connection with the Anti-fascist National Liberation Front, according to Velimir, was also a wrong line, a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> line. He went so far as 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 151</B></FONT><P>

to make the accusation in the meeting, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You have not taken a correct stand towards 'patriotic' chiefs<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (such as Cen Elezi,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp151">1</A>]</FONT> whom we had not admitted to the Front), and he also repeated what he had pronounced on the first day of his arrival, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You were wrong not to continue the talks<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the Ballists at Mukje. Along with this, according to him and those who sent him, we ought to rehabilitate Ymer Dishnica. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Fourth, the organizational line of the Party and the policy of cadres, still according to them, turned out to be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>wrong<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>carried out on a personal plane<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because allegedly we had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>removed devoted comrades from leading functions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As a conclusion, the successes of the CPA were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>petty<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>partial<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>if the CPA emerged triumphant, this was mostly thanks to Yugoslavia, the CPY and Tito<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. So much for the past. Now what had to be done? These things, according to Stojnic, must be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>put in order<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and to put them in order properly there was no alternative for us Albanian communists but to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>follow the Yugoslav road, the advice and instructions of Tito<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, which Velimir Stojnic had brought. The basic idea was this: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He who is on this road is a true communist, the others must be got rid of.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Summed up very briefly, these were the main primary accusations of Velimir Stojnic and the secret aims which he wanted to achieve by means of them precisely now, on the eve of the complete liberation of Albania, when we were emerging triumphant over the nazi-fascist occupiers, the local traitors and internal reaction.

Element from the gentry of Dibra, opponent of the Party and the National Liberation Front. In the autumn of 1944, through the intervention of Velimir Stojnic on behalf of this old agent of the kraljs of Serbia, under the pretext that he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>had not been so active as the other reactionary chiefs against the National Liberation Movement<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Cen Elezi was admitted to the ranks of the National Liberation Front. After the establishment of the people's state power, Cen Elezi was to put his activity at the service of the reactionary policy of the Anglo-Americans and the remnants of reaction in Albania.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    I cannot claim that I realized immediately, at this meeting, the extent and depth of the secret aims of the hostile work which Tito's emissaries were organizing against our Party and young state. No, the truth was to emerge clearly later, but I must say that from those moments I was more than conscious of one thing: unjust and unwarranted criticisms and accusations were being made against us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I awaited the reaction of the comrades, but they had hung their heads and were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>waiting<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I thought that they must have been dismayed at the way in which Stojnic cancelled out all our work, but since he was our <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>honoured guest<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> they did not want to oppose him openly at the first meeting. But we were communists and there was no reason for us or the guest to take offence at the truth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I took the floor again (although it was not up to me alone to speak again), and after thanking Stojnic for their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>interest<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>concern<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., I began to go over briefly and refute everything that was incorrect in his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and accusations about our line and situation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Please don't misunderstand me,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't agree with the 'criticism' which you have made here, not because comradely criticism or advice displeases us, but because the truth is completely different. The comrades will express their opinions and you will be convinced.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I hope you're right!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Stojnic smiling enigmatically. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shall hear what the comrades have to say.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After a brief silence, that same unpleasant atmosphere which developed in the meeting when we discussed whether or not Stojnic should be admitted to the meeting of our Bureau, built up again. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On many points the things which Comrade Colonel Velimir Stojnic mentioned here are contrary to those which Comrade Enver will deal with in the report to the plenum,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I say we should not be hasty. Let us reflect on them well and then talk about them.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Where are we going to find the time to reflect and then talk about them?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> put in Liri Gega there and then, with 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 153</B></FONT><P>

her well-known mania, not only to oppose Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe about the content of everything he said, but also to sneer at him openly over the peculiarities of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>pure Kor&ccedil;a idiom<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in which he spoke. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If you had thought a bit, you would not have made all those sectarian bloomers,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> retorted Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We'll have a good look at your sectarianism in the Bureau.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Better sectarian than idling your time away,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Liri snapped back in her usual style, hitting Ko&ccedil;i on a tender spot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I shall speak later about the Ko&ccedil;i-Liri <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>allergy<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the scenes which frequently took place between them, but here I want to point out that in the past such open quarrels had not occurred in the Bureau, even between them. Mostly they <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reserved<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> their spite for each other for their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>leisure time<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or came to complain to me, sometimes together, sometimes individually. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, with verbal thrust and parry, Liri Gega expressed her opinion on the main problem: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Has the line of the Party been sectarian or has it not? This is what we should discuss. I personally have acted according to the line. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I saw Velimir Stojnic beaming as soon as this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>declaration<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Liri Gega's was translated. He quickly noted it down and nodded his head in approval. In the endless meetings which we were to hold later, when we went down to Berat, this cunning inimical claim of Liri Gega's that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I have acted according to the line<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, was to be a powerful weapon in the hands of Velimir Stojnic and his collaborators. Liri Gega's flagrant sectarianism (it really was flagrant) was to serve them as the basic <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>argument<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>prove<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that the line of the CPA had been sectarian! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Throughout the whole debate Nako Spiru was extremely busy. He was rapidly writing goodness knows what in a notebook. Later I was to learn that he kept detailed notes from our meetings written in Italian to hand to his friend Dizdarevic. From that time on this became a permanent <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>duty<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 154</B></FONT><P>

Nako and I did not understand how this was done legally and openly before our eyes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Many years later I was to learn that, amongst other things, the minutes of the 2nd Plenum of the CC of the CPA (the Berat Plenum) written in Italian were found in the Central Archives of the Party. The young comrades who were working with the files of that time asked in astonishment at this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>discovery<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why these minutes in Italian, why were they translated?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> When I was told of this I laughed and recalled the tense meetings of the autumn of 1944 and the note books of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>tireless<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Nako which were filled one after the other. However, the cunning Nako was to manoeuvre beautifully with this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>extra burden<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: in acute situations when it was not in his interest to express his opinion, he buried himself in his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>notes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and did not raise his head at all. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Nevertheless, his opinion on what should be done was sought, too. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When things are prepared well, disagreements are easily resolved,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said -- a statement that could have a hundred meanings. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As for Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku, speaking in his usual slow, calm way, like the men of Kosova (he came from there, hence the pseudonym Baca), he replied: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>To think before you speak is a good habit, but I want to say one thing: the problem before us is not whether Comrade Enver, on the one hand, or Comrade Velimir, on the other hand, is right. Comrade Enver presented the theses of the main report of the Bureau which will be delivered at the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party. These theses are from all of us, because, for better or worse, we have all had our say and have all done the work for the line which we have adopted and which we all know. Therefore, I don't understand why we should take long to give our opinion about whether or not Comrade Velimir's criticisms of the line which we have all endorsed and followed are well based?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This straightforward and logical comment of Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku's, following the opposition which he had expressed in 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 155</B></FONT><P>

the earlier meeting about the admission of Stojnic to the meeting of the Bureau, certainly put a red ring round the name of Baca in the Yugoslav plotters' notebook. The open interference and pressure which they exerted on the Bureau during October for the expulsion of Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku from the Bureau of our Central Committee, was not accidental. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Precisely this first meeting of our Bureau in the presence of Velimir Stojnic and his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were to serve as an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>official<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> platform for the whole series of meetings, discussions and endless quarrels which were to consume valuable hours, days and nights during October and November of that year when we had so much work ahead of us on the eve of Liberation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In these meetings, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>of course<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the Yugoslav comrade, Tito's delegate, would also take part and would not leave matters simply at what he said at Odri&ccedil;an, but was to continue his attacks on the line of our Party in the most brutal way, making me <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the main culprit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>grave errors<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which had allegedly been observed in the line of our Party in the time of the war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Although he was not outstanding for his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>keen mind<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as an intriguer and trained agent of Tito and Rankovic he did his work well. Later we were to realize that he did everything according to a scenario carefully prepared in advance by the Yugoslav leadership. This secret scenario was based on two <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>weapons<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which the Yugoslavs had in their hands: First, on the trust and respect which our Party nurtured for the CP and the war of the peoples of Yugoslavia under the leadership of Tito. Second, on the work they had begun much earlier to prepare their agency within the leadership of our Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As I said above, we were interested in strengthening our internationalist relations with them and, as communist comrades, wanted to benefit from that good experience that might be applicable in our country. But those things which seemed to us incorrect or unsuitable for our conditions, we had not accepted and did not accept. Despite the repeated contradictions we had had with the Yugoslav comrades, we had not 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 156</B></FONT><P>

lost our faith in the CPY and Tito. This was precisely what the Yugoslav leadership had instructed Velimir Stojnic to exploit. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Besides this, the Yugoslavs had long had in their hands detailed information about the main comrades of our leadership, about their level, character, tendencies, temperament, the abilities of each of them and the standing they enjoyed in the Party and among the masses, etc. It was not for nothing that in his letter of September 1942, Tito asked for the biographies of the comrades who were elected to the CC of the Party at the 1st National Conference. Later, Blazo Jovanovic, Vukmanovic-Tempo and others were to supply their leadership with detailed information, gathered in meetings with us or in other, secret ways. The Yugoslav leadership studied this carefully and when the time was approaching to put the finishing touches to the plan of action for the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, they urgently recalled Dusan Mugosa from Albania, because, as we were told, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>he was charged with another task<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. As has been revealed since, including recent times, Dusan Mugosa under the pseudonym &Ccedil;alamani had recruited secret agents in the ranks of the cadres, both military and civilian, in the regions where he operated. But let us return to the time of the war when three to four months after the departure of Mugosa, Stojnic arrived in Albania, very well prepared. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this way, no doubt under orders from Tito and Rankovic, Velimir Stojnic was now putting the information gathered about us to successful use: both to suppress my resistance and that of other sound comrades of the Party and to encourage the anti-party factional work of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Nako Spiru and their associates. Hence, he set about and at Odri&ccedil;an succeeded in creating the following situation: everything which <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Velo<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said or did <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was right<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Tito and the CPY said this and whoever opposed it was an enemy and had to be fought<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Right from this initial phase of his secret activity, Stojnic succeeded, for the most varied reasons and motives, in 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 157</B></FONT><P>

winning over a number of the main comrades of our leadership. Who were the main ones? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     One of them was Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova. He is known and I'm not going to give a biography of him, but the fact is that his worth at the time of the war was zero. He did nothing, did not carry out any task with which we charged him, allegedly had ability with the pen but did not produce even one poor leaflet. He was a prime example of laziness. I don't know how and from what source he had gained a reputation as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a professor of Marxism-Leninism in Moscow<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because he did not prepare even one lecture. His political ideas on many questions were wrong and markedly liberal. He was a careerist who liked flattery and privileges and was the prototype of a petty-bourgeois. All these characteristics of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova were to the liking of the Yugoslav Velimir Stojnic both for that time and for the future, and therefore he supported him in all sorts of ways. Sejfulla was quick to quarrel with the comrades over any petty thing, over a toothbrush, for example. He was characterized by pronounced conceit. He claimed that he was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a veteran revolutionary<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that he had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>come from Moscow<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and that he was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a professor of Marxist theory<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, therefore he nurtured the idea that he ought to be the undisputed <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chief<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Party and the National Liberation War. Since this was not being realized, he was silently in opposition to the Party. He considered me as the person who had occupied the place <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>predestined for him even before he set foot in Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Apart from me, nobody bothered to listen to this megalomaniac. Regardless of all his shortcomings and mistakes and the criticism which I made of him, still my behaviour towards him was correct. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Yugoslavs had thoroughly apprehended Sejfulla's nature, especially his ambition to be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>party chief<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and had found in him the suitable man, even if only for a period, to develop their work of disruption in our Party and to eliminate me. So, Stojnic and Dizdarevic kept Sejfulla close beside them, cunningly flattered his petty-bourgeois pride and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 158</B></FONT><P>

even dropped such hints as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>what a pity that with a capacity such as yours, you are still only a candidate member of the Central Committee<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc. Hence, very quickly they made Sejfulla their man, maintained close relations with him, set him to work and greatly <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>praised<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theoretical abilities<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, especially when Sejfulla viciously attacked the Party over altogether non-existent stands and faults. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, as the petty-bourgeois, liberal democrat and Trotskyite he was, was quite incapable of keeping out of the maelstrom into which the Yugoslavs were driving him. From the depth of hostility to which he had sunk he began his base attack against the Party. According to him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the real existence and struggle,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Party had begun now <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that Comrade Velimir Stojnic is putting matters in order<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, implying, along with Velimir Stojnic, himself too. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The other element on whom Stojnic relied heavily was Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. He was an old member of the Kor&ccedil;a Group, a small tradesman who was included in the group of workers because he worked as a tinsmith. At first he loved the Party and communism, but was cowardly, made no efforts to extend his horizon and to raise the level of his knowledge, was one of those few workers of Kor&ccedil;a in whom arrogance and haughtiness were obvious and who remained, you might say <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>illiterate<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Neither he nor Pandi Kristo made any effort to learn. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe learned a few isolated things and all the time scribbled a few illegible notes which only he could decipher. Even these he did not write on normal paper but on envelopes. This was a mania of his. However, he did not need much paper, because he wrote little or nothing. Ko&ccedil;i was neither an organizer nor a man of action. He had a great opinion of himself and posed as being everything. His only merit was based on the fact that he was a worker and that is why he had been elected to the leadership and I respected him. I tried to help him, but I also criticized him, because he was not brilliant in anything -- on the contrary. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Titoites had been working on him for a long time through Vukmanovic-Tempo, since he came to Albania and 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 159</B></FONT><P>

took Xoxe with him on his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Balkan<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> travels to Greece. As I said, at that time I saw nothing wrong in Tempo's association with Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and agreed that they should go together to Greece twice, because of the additional fact that Xoxe knew the Greek language and originated from Negovan. However, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe returned from Greece completely the man of Tempo and the Yugoslav secret agency. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All the time he was in prison we had respect for Ko&ccedil;i. When he came out of prison and worked together with me in the leadership we were disillusioned. We sent him with the task of leading the struggle in Kor&ccedil;a; he kept himself busy with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the base and the rear<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and concerned himself with the clothing that was gathered in Lavdar and Pun&euml;mira. There he was given every opportunity to work, to create and to organize, but he proved to be an undistinguished comrade of the leadership and made no concrete contribution to the work of the Party, let alone that of the army. With the conceit and pretensions he had, it was inevitable that he would cultivate a great internal discontent. Of course, Tempo was well aware of his spiritual state and it was well known also to Velimir Stojnic who took him over, worked on him, urged him in the direction we mentioned above and made him a weapon against our Party and against me personally. Brainwashed and inflated in this way, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe emerged as one of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>persecuted proletarians<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>one of the men of the Party with a proletarian heart and great value for the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The third person whom Stojnic managed to win over was Nako Spiru. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nako was unlike the other two from a number of aspects. He was intelligent, clear on the line, courageous and a good organizer. I liked and respected him and, after the death of Qemal, recommended him to replace Qemal in the Youth 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT></SUP> 
Later, Rankovic, the Yugoslav counterpart of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, did not fail to recommend Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe even to Stalin as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a leader with a proletarian spirit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the most resolute<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the most clear<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the leadership of the CPA (!), etc.
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 160</B></FONT><P>

Organization and in the leadership of the Party. I continually consulted with Nako, because most of the time we were together. At all times he was in the effective leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      However, just as much as the other two, Nako Spiru was a petty bourgeois in his spirit and he had a number of very marked negative traits. He was extremely ambitious and inclined to intrigues. He had gossip and criticism, both justified and ill-founded, on the tip of his tongue. He did not fail to encourage those he liked to advance and to praise them, he was a person who played favourites and worked to fulfil the great desire he had to surround himself with people who listened to him, obeyed him and carried out the orders he gave. Nako was extremely inquisitive and rummaged around to discover the pettiest personal facts about anyone. Many a time when he came and told me petty personal details, which were none of our business, about this or that person, I was astonished at him and criticized him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Where do you hear these things, Nako?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him reproachfully. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I have my methods and my people who keep me in formed,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      All these were dangerous tendencies for a communist and a leader and apart from other things, as a result of these tendencies, Nako became involved in that dirty anti-party work which Tito's emissaries hatched up. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The Yugoslavs knew these serious defects and came to know them better. Velimir Stojnic and especially his aide, Nijaz Dizdarevic, who was allegedly engaged with the work of the youth, fostered these ambitions in him and compromised him very gravely. They went so far that Nako Spiru was to send Tito and the CC of the CPY secret reports written in his own hand, reports which they used against him later as pressure and some of which they published, including those parts in which, while describing <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the deplorable situation of our war, the mistakes and bad situation in the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, he attacked me, put the blame on me and sought their aid to ensure that 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 161</B></FONT><P>

I was removed from the post of General Secretary of the Party. This is how far this comrade went in his anti-party work. The Yugoslavs, carefully studying Nako's careerist tendencies, his petty-bourgeois desire for power, his spirit as a carping critic, flattered his pride and ambition and encouraged him in all these directions. Nako was to associate himself with their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of our line, not because he was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mistaken<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in his evaluation of the line. In the Yugoslavs' <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Nako saw the possibilities for power which were being opened up. If the past line were to be rejected as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>incorrect<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the main bearer of that line, the General Secretary of the Party, would be rejected, too. Who would take his place?! Obviously, he who contributed most to blackening the past and who would win the affection and gratitude of the Yugoslavs in this way. Because this is how he judged matters, Nako was to involve himself with all his might in the plot, brutally trampling, not only on the Party, but also on the sacrifices of his own life in the 3 to 4 years of the war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     These then were the three main brigands whom the Yugoslavs, through their emissary Stojnic, were now to unleash in all their ferocity against the line of the Party and against the indisputable victory which we had achieved and were achieving in the war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, the portrait which I painted above of these elements could never have been made or even imagined with this clarity at Odri&ccedil;an or even later when we went down to Berat. Irrespective of those shortcomings with which I was acquainted, I considered these people as comrades and treated them as comrades of the leadership of the Party in every step and action which we took. That is why, when I heard the gravest opinions and accusations against the Party from their own mouths, I was taken aback and felt that I was facing a group of comrades who were placing themselves en bloc against the line of the Party and personally against me, the General Secretary. Naturally, I did not realize immediately that we were faced with an organized plot. These three com- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 162</B></FONT><P>

rades of the leadership disguised everything with their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>concern<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>examine the issues<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>evaluate the past correctly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to learn from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the experience and comradely criticism of the Yugoslav brothers<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>eliminate the mistakes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proceed better in the future<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to come before the Central Committee as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clearly as possible<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>principled criticism and self-criticism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, indeed with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Bolshevik<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> criticism and self-criticism, etc. In short, all of them were to vow from start to finish that they were acting solely for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the good of the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>its salvation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (!). In fact, however, all these vows about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the good of the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were a bluff, a mask to conceal the plot which had been hatched up to the detriment of the Party behind my back and the backs of all the other comrades who remained in sound principled positions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this meeting of the Political Bureau in which Stojnic launched his accusations, Liri Gega took part, too, but it was her <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>bad luck<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to be used by the Yugoslav agency as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>scapegoat<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. As I mentioned above, during his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>service<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the region of Vlora in the spring and summer of 1943, Dusan Mugosa became well acquainted with Liri Gega, took note of her many weaknesses, especially her ambitious and careerist spirit, and kept close to her to foster these shortcomings in the interest of his work as an agent. To give the devil his due, Mugosa carried out this dirty anti-party work with Liri Gega and with a number of others in masterly fashion. The sectarian actions which were recognized and had already been condemned by our Party were, in the first place, the fruit of the work of Dusan Mugosa as an agent, in which his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>pupil<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and agent Liri Gega displayed obvious zeal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For these things, Dusan Mugosa deserved the heaviest condemnation, but in fact he did not leave Albania under a cloud. On the contrary, after performing the role with which his leadership had charged him, by recruiting and fouling whomever he could. Duqi cleared out and left our Party a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>heritage<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mistakes of sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which the leadership of the CPY now needed to accuse the leadership of our Communist Party of being <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>incompetent<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 163</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But in order to make these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> stick and seem to have a concrete basis, the Yugoslavs now had to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>attack<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> their loyal agent Liri Gega, even if only temporarily, as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the embodiment of the sectarian line of the CPA<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. The wide-ranging attack which was made on our Communist Party was hidden behind <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Liri's mistakes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All this painful anti-party history was to take place during the months of October and November in the liberated city of Berat where we arrived, as far as I remember, a few days after the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>platform<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> meeting at Odri&ccedil;an.

On the eve of the plot
</B>

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The establishment of the main leadership of the Party, the Anti-fascist General Council and the General Staff in the liberated city of Berat, after about four years of fighting and battles in the difficult conditions of illegality, showed that decisive historic moments for our country had arrived. The National Liberation War was being crowned with major successes. The correct Marxist-Leninist line of the Party was leading our people towards the final victory. The love and trust of the people and the partisans for the Party was great and deeply implanted in their hearts, because it was the Party which educated them, organized them, armed them and led them into the war and to victory. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We had virtually liberated the south of Albania. Thus, the General Staff had come down to the liberated city of Berat and there we prepared the strategic plan of the assault for the liberation of Tirana. A little before we entered Berat, the German rearguard which was encircled by our forces shelled the city. A number of houses were destroyed, but no one was killed. This attack was like the last gasp of an asthmatic, because freedom had already triumphed in these parts. From here we dispatched the orders for military opera- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 164</B></FONT><P>

tions to divisions, brigades and other territorial units, which were to assemble and begin the assault on the capital and, after they liberated it, to pursue the enemy hotly until the complete liberation of Albania. I was in Berat when I received the news about the liberation of our beloved capital city, and a little later, the news of the liberation of virtually all Albania. From Berat I issued the order to some other brigades of our triumphant army to cross our state borders and advance into Yugoslavia. There these brigades, together with two other brigades of our army (the 5th and 3rd), which had received orders to cross the border in September and had liberated most of Kosova, were to continue the war against the German nazis, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Yugoslav partisan comrades I instructed our partisans that they must fight unsparingly in complete unity with the Yugoslav partisans and in an internationalist spirit for the liberation of the peoples of Yugoslavia. And the Albanian partisans made the word of their Communist Party a reality. They fought with great heroism in Kosova, Montenegro, Sandjak, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serbia and Macedonia. In these battles hundreds of our partisans were killed and thousands wounded. But the Titoites trampled with both their feet over their heroism and blood and repaid us with hostility and plots against our Party and our socialist Homeland. Nevertheless, we carried out an internationalist duty, and irrespective of what happens, the peoples of Yugoslavia will never forget this sacrifice which the Albanian people made for them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     There in liberated Berat we had decided to work out and solve a series of important tasks which were to remain in history as outstanding events for those moments and for the future. One of these was the preparation of the report for the meeting of the Anti-fascist National Liberation General Council which was to be held before the Plenum of the CC of the Party and the drafting of other relevant documents. This meeting of the Council, which we held with complete success, had great historic importance, because there the Anti-fascist Committee was turned into the Democratic Government of Albania. Thus, on the eve 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 165</B></FONT><P>

of Liberation the country had its democratically elected government. This government was the main executive and order issuing organ of our people's state power established by the people through struggle on the ruins of the state power of the enemy classes defeated together with the occupiers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Another important task was, without doubt, the preparation for the 2nd Plenum of the CC of the Party, a job which, as I said, we had begun at Odri&ccedil;an, but which, after the interference and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Velimir Stojnic, was in an impasse and dragging on and on with endless discussions and debates. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     During our stay in Berat we had placed the centre of the General Staff in the house of the beys of Vrioni, where we had our offices and where I slept. The other comrades were billeted in other houses of the city. These comrades, such as Nako, Ko&ccedil;i, Sejfulla, turned up once a day, with their hands in their pockets, inquired whether there was any news from the military zones and wandered off again. We had charged Pandi Kristo with the task of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>military security<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but later it was realized that he busied himself with other work of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>security<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. He observed what was done at the Staff, who came and went, what was discussed, and this he reported to Ko&ccedil;i and Velimir Stojnic. Pandi was one of those elements who was implicated up to his neck in the plot at Berat. He was a nullity from every point of view and, apart from the fact that he came from the ranks of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proletarians<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (in fact, he had been an apprentice), there was nothing brilliant about his past, either. From time to time he boasted of being a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>veteran<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> element of the Communist Group of Kor&ccedil;a, but all of us knew very well that in 1935, when the Trotskyite faction of Niko Xoxi emerged in this group and opposed the correct line and directives of Comrade Ali Kelmendi, Pandi Kristo was one of the few to associate himself with the factionalist Niko Xoxi. After the deserved denunciation of the faction, Pandi <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>withdrew<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> from it, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>admitted<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> his grave mistake, and united with the sound part of the group. However, he did not rid himself of his old vice of engaging in factionalist activity. Especially after the spring of 1943 he joined up 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 166</B></FONT><P>

with the other Xoxe, Ko&ccedil;i, turned into a blind follower of his and, consequently, placed himself in the service of that agency which had recruited Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe -- the Yugoslav agency. All through the years of the war he had gone almost <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unnoticed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and he began to move and show up in the autumn of 1944, precisely when Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Stojnic considered it in order to activize him for their sinister aims. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As for Liri Gega, she stayed <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>closer<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to me, impelled by other motives and for other objectives. She thought that rank and positions were shared out in my office and she aimed to grab a big slice for herself. She made herself quite ridiculous with her desire for the limelight. At times she would come to me with a piece of paper in her hand: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Have a look at this!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> she said proudly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I've drafted two laws. If you agree, we can print and distribute them<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Take them to Doctor Nishani<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp166">1</A>]</FONT> to see,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied ironically. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He and the comrades with him know about these matters.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us approve them in the Bureau first,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> insisted Liri, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and send them to the Doctor all ready.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      It would simply turn back to the work I had in front of me and Liri would go out. A little later she would come back with another <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proposal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. One day she stopped me in the street when I was going with Nako and Ko&ccedil;i to see the hall where, shortly after this, we were to hold the meeting of the Anti-fascist National Liberation General Council. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I've made a draft of the government,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> she said in all seriousness, and held out to me a piece of paper. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I've allocated all the ministers and the Council of Ministers. Take it and

Omer Nishani (1887-1954) -- patriot and revolutionary democrat, one of the prominent figures of our National Liberation Movement. From September 1943 a member of the National Liberation General Council, at the Congress of P&euml;rmet he was elected chairman of the Anti-fascist National Liberation General Council. After the liberation of the country from 1946 to July 1953 he was President of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the PRA.

look at it when you have time, but you know that this matter can't wait. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nako took the paper from her hand, and after blowing a cloud of tobacco smoke over <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the government of Liri<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, he began to examine it with his well-known sarcasm. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Your 'government' has two shortcomings,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said to Liri. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You have left the post of one deputy prime minister blank and your name, my poor fool (he had this favourite expression on the tip of his tongue), does not figure anywhere. Oh, I beg your pardon,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he added, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you have left it out from modesty. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, on my honour I didn't!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Liri. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I did not leave that space for myself, but I could find no one to fill it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very well,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told her, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>take it to Pandi Kristo, because he is gathering up the proposals.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     There were some amusing notes about Liri Gega's crude eccentricities but we had no time to waste on them and neither the moment nor the atmosphere were suitable for such things. In general a sombre atmosphere prevailed, especially around Baca and me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Under the pretext that I was occupied with work, because brigade commanders, members of the Council and other party comrades came to meet me, Nako, Ko&ccedil;i, Sejfulla and company established a silent, undeclared boycott against me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The arrival of Hysni Kapo and Gogo Nushi at Berat<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> somewhat improved my spirits, because these comrades brought me the warm affection and sincerity of communists. They came from the fighting front, and not from the back rooms where intrigues and plots were hatched up. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile the house where Velimir Stojnic and Nijaz Dizdarevic or, as it was called, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Yugoslav Military Mis-

sion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> stayed had been turned into a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>main centre of the work<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and gossip. There Nako, Ko&ccedil;i, Sejfulla and others stayed for hours on end. I saw this great <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>affinity,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and I did not like it, because they were wasting a lot of time and keeping somewhat aloof from me precisely at a time when we had an endless series of jobs which had accumulated and many new problems which cropped up at every moment. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From other comrades I was to hear that they were not telling <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>stories<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> there, but distorting history. When they came to see me I saw them looking sombre and arrogant. Although the situation created and their behaviour did not make a good impression on me, nevertheless I was not alarmed and did not lose my aplomb. I had long been acquainted with the irritability and moodiness of Nako, while the megalomania and pettishness of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova were quite normal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Something else attracted my attention at that time. Major Ivanov, the representative of the Soviet Military Mission, came to see me less frequently after he became friendly with Velimir Stojnic. He came just for the sake of form, all dressed up, received some information, and off he went for a walk. One day, I remember, he began to speak in glowing terms about the Yugoslav generals such as Peko Dapcevic, Kosta Nadj, etc. Apparently Velimir Stojnic, Nako Spiru and Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova were working on Major Ivanov and had won him over. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I continued to work unceasingly in order to cope with the many demands of the army, the state power and the National Liberation Front. Whenever I had any <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>free time<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, I concentrated on the report or the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>referat<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as we called it, which I was to present at the Plenum of the Central Committee. Logic told me that this report, because of the decisive moments at which it would be delivered and because of the forum to which it would be presented, ought to deal forcefully and profoundly with two main issues. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     First, since we were on the verge of achieving the complete liberation of Albania, the report <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On the Political Line of the CPA<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> ought to sum up the results of this line from 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 169</B></FONT><P>

the founding of the Party, and especially from the 1st National Conference, to Liberation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Second, the new situation we were entering faced the Party with new, major, cardinal tasks, therefore the second part of the report must, without fail, deal with them profoundly, reflect the major tasks of the future, and hence, determine the future political line of a party in power. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was my own conviction and this conviction was reinforced when I talked with a number of comrades, and so in this spirit I was writing the report which I was to deliver at the 2nd Plenum of the CC of the Party. After some time I completed the first draft and distributed it to the comrades of the Bureau to read. On the insistence of Ko&ccedil;i and Nako, who also voiced <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the opinion of Comrade Stojnic<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, a copy was given to Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova to read, too. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It doesn't matter that he is not a member of the Bureau,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Nako. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let him see it, because he might give us some ideas, especially in the aspect of the theoretical treatment of the problems.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (!) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, this variant of the report did not reach the Plenum. From Nako, Sejfulla, Ko&ccedil;i and others a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>bombardment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> broke out over every phrase and paragraph of the draft which I gave them to read, a bombardment allegedly from their concern that the report should reflect <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the truth about the line,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> as well as possible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It is a real Odyssey to describe how the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>official<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> variant was arrived at, the one which I was obliged to read at the Plenum, because there was nothing else I could do. I shall mention just a few of these episodes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Opening the first variant of the report, I made a considered and mature assessment of the line pursued by the CPA in the grave conditions of the war and the terror and arrived at the correct conclusion that the political line of the CPA during the years of the war had been a correct and consistent line, a line on the basis of which the Party itself grew bigger and stronger and under its leadership a whole people was achieving the decisive victory. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 170</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Sejfulla and Nako came frowning into the room where I was working and began: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Right from the outset there's exaltation,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Sejfulla. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There's excessive praise for the general line of the Party.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On what do you base this remark?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In order to determine the character of a line accurately all its component parts must be balanced correctly,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla began his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>philosophizing<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Here you stress the general. But you overlook the particular, the sectarianism and opportunism, each of which has appeared at different times. The whole must be taken into consideration, because there's no general without the particular.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Listen, Sejfulla,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I'm not opposed to your general or your particular, but this is neither the place nor the time for spinning words. Tell me concretely on what do you base the things you say?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You mention only the successes, the victories, the positive! Agreed, but why don't you point out the sectarianism and opportunism which have shown up?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>First,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't deny the opportunist or sectarian manifestations and stands, and they have been pointed out in the proper place. Second, and this is the main thing, we have achieved a great victory. Neither sectarianism nor opportunism could have led us to this victory, but only a correct line.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That's what you think, but our opinion is different,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Sejfulla. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was not so much surprised at his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opinion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> as at the coolness with which he spoke. I felt that matters were now much worse. Moreover, Sejfulla's emphasis on <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our opinion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> uttered in the presence of Nako, who up till now had kept out of the argument, biting his finger nails from time to time with his characteristic irritability, made me realize that they had not come to make some criticisms, but were demanding essential changes. Nevertheless, I was convinced that the political line of the Party during the years of the war had been correct, and I had stressed and defended this a number of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 171</B></FONT><P>

times in arguments with Velimir Stojnic, therefore I did not retreat. But they did not retreat, either. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Are you of the same opinion as Sejfulla, Nako?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Absolutely!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Nako tersely. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We must consider it together with the others, but let us continue,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Sejfulla took some crumpled scraps of paper from his in side pocket and spread them on the table. His untidy scrawl, like the efforts of a first-year pupil, immediately struck my eye and suddenly the fact crossed my mind that in his whole lifetime Sejfulla had had very little occasion to write in Albanian. However, this was just a passing thought. The whole series of the most astonishing <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>observations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the dirtiest <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> began. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Front!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he raised his voice at one moment as if something had occurred to him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The line of the Party regarding the Front! You have embellished it greatly, Enver! Many mistakes have been made in the line toward the Front. How was the Conference of Peza organized?! Try to remember! Why didn't Lumo Sk&euml;ndo<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> and Ali K&euml;lcyra<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> attend it? Why didn't the Party win over these and many other patriots with influence, but allowed them to line up behind fascism? What about Abaz Kupi? Why did Bazi withdraw from the Movement and go over to reaction? What about other chiefs like these and the people around them?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla was beginning to get wound up. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No! The Front did not open its doors as a mass organization should have done and did not open them not because they couldn't be opened, but precisely because thee sectarian line of the Party was the factor which led to such a result.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I listened to him declaiming so haughtily and, suddenly,

just as I was getting very angry, I remembered Lenin's famous remark about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>brainless philosophers.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I had the prototype of such a philosopher standing in front of me. However, the argument was not in the field of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>pure<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> philosophy. I controlled my anger and fixed my eyes on the small pasty white face I had before me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Sejfulla,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>when we were preparing and holding the Conference of Peza in the heat of the war, as like as not you did not even know that a village called Peza existed in Albania. As like as not, at that time you did not know that we had formed our Communist Party, that we were arousing the people in the war, that we were taking the fate of the Homeland and the people into our hands. You were still abroad in exile at that time, Sejfulla, so I ask you now: How do you know how we organized the Conference of Peza. . . ?! Second, from what do you draw the conclusion that the Party drove Lumo Sk&euml;ndo, Ali K&euml;lcyra and the other scum of Ballist reaction under the skirts of the occupiers? Third, how do you know that the line of the Front was sectarian and its doors were closed to those who wanted to fight? In short, my question can be summed up like this: From whose positions, in whose name and in whose favour are you making these accusations and insinuations that you mentioned?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Please,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he mumbled, now deadly pale. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are trying to stand over me, and I have criticism about this, too: you want to impose your opinions on us by all means. You. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Just leave me out of this. You made accusations against the Party and its line. You must answer for these accusations, I'm only one person and this has no great importance.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What has no great importance?! The chief of the Party is the central figure and in his hands. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Sejfulla,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I interrupted, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>stop dodging the issue, answer the questions I asked you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Our conclusion is that which I mentioned,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he tried to pull in his horns and stole a glance at Nako. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The debate with Sejfulla and Nako went on at length, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 173</B></FONT><P>

and, later, the others were to enter into these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>discussions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. With the exception of Baca, they were all unanimous. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For many parts they brought me fragments and phrases ready prepared and insisted in unison that their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>discovery<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> must certainly go into the report. I opposed them, brought forward arguments, but it was impossible to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>convince<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> them. I recalled events and stands of the past, compared them with the Marxist theory, examined them from all aspects, but I could never convince myself that we had acted wrongly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But why do the comrades think differently?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked myself over and over again. This sudden about-face was worrying me just as much as their endless <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and accusations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile Ko&ccedil;i came and insisted that in my report I must stress the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>outstanding contribution of Comrade Tito to the progress of our Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Nako came and demanded that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that part about the youth should be revised because it comes out feeble<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Liri Gega came and said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That business about sectarianism is nothing, the stress should be against opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We should add,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> put in Sejfulla, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that our stand towards the Balli Komb&euml;tar has always been vacillating, hesitant and opportunist.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Up till now you have talked about a 'sectarian stand', how did it become opportunist?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Dialectics envisages both!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> concluded Sejfulla and racked his brain to find where else the report should be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>edited<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, in the report which I had handed them I came out with self-criticism and criticism about the work, but Nako, Ko&ccedil;i, Sejfulla and the others, who had aims which I could not know at that time, on all occasions when there was any mention of shortcomings or weaknesses found it easier to strengthen the dose in order to attain the ends that they had decided on behind the scene. As soon as they saw, for example, that I emphasized in the proper place that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>manifestations of sectarianism and opportunism have appeared<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Sejfulla jumped up: 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 174</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us make it 'have been manifested openly, frequently and in obvious ways'. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In alarming ways!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>corrected<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Nako there and then. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very good,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> agreed the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>philosopher<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>So, let us leave it like this, 'a large doze of both sectarianism and opportunism has appeared openly and frequently in alarming ways'.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     One of the first things which struck me was the complete conformity of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opinions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of our comrades with those of the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>comrades<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I had heard the same views from the mouth of Tempo a year or so earlier at Labinot and Kucaka. Stojnic had repeated the same accusations to me at Helm&euml;s and Odri&ccedil;an during September and October, and now Sejfulla, Nako and Ko&ccedil;i were repeating the same things. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     What did this mean? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The stand of Nako, in particular, seemed to me quite astonishing and beyond understanding. If there was anyone who was more informed and linked most directly with the line of our Party, this was Nako, one of my closest collaborators during the grave years of the war. What had happenned to him now? Why had he turned against himself?! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile, the endless meetings of the Bureau of the Central Committee continued, meetings in which the exchanges of loaded remarks went on and on and ready-made phrases were served up to me in the room where I was working on the report and other materials. I cannot remember exactly how many times we met during the period of two months that we stayed at Berat and how many whole nights we wasted in unprincipled debates and quarrels. However since the problems which were raised and enlarged on were more or less the same, it could be said that all those meetings and discussions were sessions of a single meeting. Right from the outset the discussions took a wrong course and from those moments I felt clearly that the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>word<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Velimir Stojnic had brought to Odri&ccedil;an had done us great harm. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, the true aims of Stojnic's intervention were still not clear to me and I had no way of knowing what they were. But the fact that Ko&ccedil;i and Nako were so greatly in-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 175</B></FONT><P>

fluenced by what Stojnic said was very obvious It seems to, me, I thought, that Ko&ccedil;i and Nako are displaying their solidarity with Stojnic's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the aim of demonstrating to him and to others that they are <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>capable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of understanding the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mistake<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and taking a stand towards it, and, moreover, are <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>capable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of rejecting what they have accepted and approved in the past for the sake of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>improving the situation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Undoubtedly, a self-critical stand towards the mistakes of the past is a norm for mature and devoted communists. In the concrete instance, however, what in fact was more than right, was being called wrong. In this instance, I thought, the mistake of the comrades lies in the fact that they suffer from, an inferiority complex. They are unable to make a proper assessment of what we have all done together and to defend it with all their might, but on the contrary, reject it simply because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Yugoslav delegate told them to do so<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I could never reconcile myself to this sort of action, therefore, I tried carefully with all my might to convince the comrades of the truth. By producing facts to oppose what Velimir Stojnic said about our line, I fought especially to make the comrades clear so that they would understand that we had no reason to give up or to reject the things in which we were right, simply be cause <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Velimir says so<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Indeed, through my open opposition, I strove to convince them that no calamity would occur if we opposed our guest's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to his face. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I saw with regret, however, that neither Ko&ccedil;i nor Nako was convinced. They persisted in their attitude, hopping from one point to another. In these meetings Liri Gega was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>on my side<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but only on one problem -- <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>My actions have not been sectarian but necessary and correct,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> she insisted. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We were at war, there was no time for idle talk. . . !<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As for Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku, he mostly listened, prepared to say <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>something<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but the hasty interjections of Nako, Ko&ccedil;i and Liri either interrupted him when he began to speak, or did not allow him to speak at all. After a number of sessions 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 176</B></FONT><P>

of such arguments, their attacks, especially those of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, were suddenly focussed on Liri Gega and Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku: strong accusations of sectarianism were levelled against Liri Gega, while Baca was accused of inactivity. It was proposed and decided that both of them should be expelled from the Political Bureau, and since this left only three of us, there and then it was proposed to co-opt two others. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We should do this right now,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and later, to put the thing in order, we should put our proposal and decision on the expulsion of these two to the Plenum! We should also raise the election of other comrades to the Bureau there, too. For the moment, however,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I think we should co-opt to the Bureau two of the best comrades, Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and Pandi Kristo! These two will bring a new spirit to the Bureau.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I shall speak later about what was hidden behind these proposals and decisions which were put forward and carried out there and then. At present I want to point out some of the impressions which I formed at those moments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      First, I could not but be astounded at the fact that Ko&ccedil;i's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proposal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was made quite <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unexpectedly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, and equally unexpectedly was at once approved by Nako and Velimir as though it were about something simple, like getting rid of two chairs and not of two comrades of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. How could I explain this? <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Inexcusable irresponsibility in the solution of problems and the settling of personal animosities (I had in mind especially the relations between Ko&ccedil;i and Liri) by way of vengeance and not in the communist way,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I thought at those moments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Second, two new members of the Political Bureau were proposed and approved there and then, without any preliminary study, consultation or examination of the persons, their stand, and so on. How was Ko&ccedil;i able to come out with these two names so suddenly?! And how could they be accepted <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>immediately<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, without consulting the Central Committee, or at least consulting those comrades who were in Berat at that time? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      At those moments I branded this activity, too, as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>irres-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 177</B></FONT><P>

ponsibility<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>taking hasty decisions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>basing the election of cadres on personal sympathies and relations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      My opposition to these unexpected proposals could not have any effect and it didn't because I was one against two, without mentioning Velimir Stojnic whose face was beaming because Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>seized the initiative<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> like this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Later it emerged clearly that the proposal was not unexpected and the approval of it was not given <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>irresponsibly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>hastily<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> by Nako and Ko&ccedil;i. On the contrary, everything had been well calculated, had been discussed and weighed up carefully behind the scenes. Amongst others, Pandi Kristo was to make this quite clear four years later at the 11th Plenum<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp177">1</A>]</FONT> of the CC of the Party in September 1948. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>At Berat,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> admitted Pandi Kristo, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Nako approached me and told me about Miladin's 'mistakes' and about the dissatisfaction with Enver, Baca and Liri. Day by day, he and Ko&ccedil;i talked about such things with me and finally it was decided that Liri and Baca should be removed from the Bureau before the Plenum and at the Plenum the Central Committee should be re-organized. There the question of Enver should be examined because this could not be done in the Bureau. At one moment, I asked Nako,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Pandi, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>'What is going to be done about the Commander?<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> What impression will his removal make among the people and in the Party?' 'We have to persuade him,' Nako replied, 'but if we can't persuade him, the pistol will.'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[3]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Velimir Stojnic took part in the secret meeting at which what was to be done in the Bureau was decided outside the Bureau. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As Pandi Kristo testified through his own mouth in 1948,  he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was influenced<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[4]</FONT> and began to speak about his discontent.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They don't respect the workers,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Pandi had said at that secret meeting. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I was left out. I was attached to the staff at Kucaka but what did I do? I was reduced to a cook.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Velimir Stojnic listened and nodded approval. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT><I>Tako je! Tako je! </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp178">*</A>]</FONT> What is the comrade's origin?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Worker,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> had replied Ko&ccedil;i. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He's a member of our Central Committee.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very good, very good, carry on,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the Yugoslav delegate had encouraged Pandi. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Pandi had poured out everything that came to his mind against the Party, Miladin and me, and Stojnic had asked: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How has this comrade been promoted in the party?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Through struggle, through efforts!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i had replied (although Pandi himself had said that he had done nothing or at the most had been a staff cook. But Velimir Stojnic valued something else. He valued Pandi Kristo's ability to cook up slanders and accusations). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      After this meeting Nako had taken Pandi Kristo aside: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Congratulations!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he had said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They (the Yugoslavs) are very pleased with you.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Two or three days later Pandi Kristo shoulder to shoulder with Sejfulla and Ko&ccedil;i and Nako, linked together by Velimir Stojnic, were to rise as a solid bloc against me in the Bureau. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The second step of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was achieved. The Bureau of our Central Committee was reorganized behind the scenes and now, in its composition of five members, four were obedient tools of the Yugoslavs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Understandably, after this the confusion, attacks and accusations burst out more openly and prevailed more readily. My isolation became complete not only within the Bureau but also outside it. Automatically, matters were getting worse and

worse and the day when the Plenum was to be held was approaching. I saw that it would be extremely difficult to determine the line and the tasks for the future. A situation had been created in which they were completely involved with the past, or more precisely with blackening the past. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     During one of these days, on the eve of the Plenum, Nexhmije [Xhuglini-Hoxha] came to me. There were tears in her eyes and with a feeling of concern and despair which she was quite unable to conceal she said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How is this. . . right on the eve of Liberation you have apparently decided to withdraw me from the leadership of the Youth?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked in surprise. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Who told you this?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why pretend you don't know? Nako summoned me and proposed that we take a 'walk'. We walked beside the Osum River and there he told me: 'You came to Berat for nothing. . . (she was in the Dibra region and the highlands of Central Albania as the delegate of the Central Committee of the Youth to the 2nd Partisan Division and the terrain in which it was operating). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>'How do you mean for nothing. . . ?!' I asked him,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Nexhmije told me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>'Comrade Enver sent me a letter and at the end told me that in November the meeting of the CC of the Youth and the Congress of Anti-fascist Women would be held. I waited for you to notify me, but since no notification came either from you or from the comrades in the Women's organization, I thought your notification must have got stuck somewhere on the way. That's why I came. Why, should I not have come?' 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>'No, no, since you have come you'd better stay,' Nako told me, 'but you are not to continue to work with the Youth. You have been appointed to another important task as a member of the Agitation and Propaganda Commission attached to the CC of the Party and now you are going to work with Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova.'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Nexhmije told me these things and fell silent. I was silent

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 180</B></FONT><P>

for a moment, too, then I pulled myself together and said with a smile: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Is that what you are upset about?! We have a great deal to do and we can't all be engaged with the Youth. The sector which Nako mentioned is very important, too, especially now that the Party and people are taking state power.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I spoke in this way because I did not want her to learn about the great quarrels and splits in the leadership. I did not want her to learn about them, because they were extremely delicate problems and had to be kept very secret, but also because I did not want to upset and worry her when, from day to day, we were expecting the great news of the liberation of Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Inwardly, however, I realized that matters were worse than I had thought. By not calling Nexhmije to attend either the Congress of Women or the meeting of the Central Committee of the Youth, Nako and company wanted to keep her away from me, because she might hinder them in what they wanted to do, might hear what was being said and inform me. This struck me immediately and I asked myself: What is this? Are they up to something behind our back. . . ? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      However, I kept my mouth shut, because I could not accuse the comrades of such base activity. I was dissatisfied about their activities and stands and my suspicions were building up relentlessly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I spent those days with Hysni [Kapo] and Gogo [Nushi] but said nothing to them, either. I thought it was all an internal problem of the Bureau and that all the difficulties created would be settled in the end; besides, I considered it would be a violation of party secrecy if I talked to them about it. However, I thought and acted in this way because I still did not know that a plot was being prepared behind the scenes. I did not know about the perfidy which the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>comrades<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were engaged in every minute, against the Party and people, first of all, but also against me personally. Had I known this, undoubtedly matters would have taken another course. I would have come out openly before the comrades of the CC, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 181</B></FONT><P>

not to brainwash them, but to make the truth clear them, to warn them about what was being hatched up. And since I did not know what had gone on behind the scenes, I went to the 2nd Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party convinced that we had disagreements in opinions and views with the delegate of the Yugoslav leadership and that the comrades of the Bureau had wrongly expressed their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>solidarity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with him, but I had not understood clearly what was really hidden behind this solidarity. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Two or three days before the beginning of the Plenum, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe came to me all concern and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The vital aid of the Yugoslav comrades, especially of Comrades Tempo and Velo, must be brought out more clearly.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What must we stress more about the aid of these comrades?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him in such a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>normal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> tone of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sincerity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that Ko&ccedil;i did not sense what I was getting at with my question. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>From the founding of the Party to this very day!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said with amazing zeal. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We must stress especially that the coming of Comrades Tempo and Velo helped us to distinguish the major mistakes of the past and the present and to dot the i's better.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      At first I saw the conformity of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Tempo and Stojnic with those of Ko&ccedil;i and Nako and Sejfulla with surprise, and then saw them as a coincidence, but during the proceedings of the Plenum in particular, I was convinced that it was not a coincidence but an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>adoption<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslavs' <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> by our comrades. This was snobbishness, a sign of immaturity, a symptom of submission and putting themselves unconditionally under the judgment of someone <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>more powerful<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, regardless of how the truth stood. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Undoubtedly, all these things were harmful and to be condemned, but I thought that at the Plenum, and especially after it, tempers would calm down, the comrades would reflect correctly, would judge matters better and would correct themselves in the course of the work. It was to be proved subsequently, however, that these arguments of mine were 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 182</B></FONT><P>

not realistic. At the most they were expressions of my subjective desire and good positive intentions in estimating a great unknown problem. However, the truth lay elsewhere and it was much more serious and more bitter. Thus, it was to be proved that the opposition of the comrades of the Bureau to the line of the Party and to me was not a chance aberration, but was something pre-arranged and concocted in meetings and discussions behind the scenes with the incitement and under the leadership of Velimir Stojnic and Nijaz Dizdarevic. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This was a plot that had been hatched up for two or three months on end in secrecy, behind my back and behind the back of the Central Committee of the Party, and now was to burst in the Plenum in all its ferocity. 

<A NAME="s2iii">

The Berat plot
</B>

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     The Plenum began its proceedings on November 23, in the grave conditions I have described above. Apart from the members and candidates elected to the Central Committee of the Party at the 1st Conference of the Party at Labinot in March 1943 (the only absentee was the candidate of the Plenum Mehmet Shehu because he had been charged with carrying out the actions for the establishment and maintenance of order in newly liberated Tirana), Velimir Stojnic also was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>invited<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to take part in the Plenum as the representative of a sister party. I say <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>invited<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> because the way matters stood, Stojnic would have come to the meeting even uninvited, supported by the majority in his favour in the Bureau, in order to carry through to the finish the third stage of his plan -- the splitting and disruption of the Central Committee of the Party and the removal of me from the leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As far as I remember the three reports on the agenda were delivered on the first day. A reflection of all that had 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 183</B></FONT><P>

been prepared and was simmering behind the scenes was the fact that the first person to speak was Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, who delivered a report <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On the present political situation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the country. The pitiful document which Sejfulla and company had prepared is not worthy of mention. I want to point out only that the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>report on the political moment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was more a pathetic declamation written by an opportunist, without any idea or problem, without any directive or task for the moment, let alone for the future. This individual who let the heroic war of the people and the Party pass him by without getting involved in it, he who far from any danger, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sitting in the garden at my ease<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp183">1</A>]</FONT>, warmed his hands on the seared body of the Homeland, now basing himself on the war and heroism of the whole people and Party, found the occasion to boast and strut about what he had no part in. The time had not yet come to express his idea about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chief of the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which he brought out later. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I read the report <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On the Political Line of the CPA<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which had been intended as the main report delivered at the Plenum. As far as I know, there is a copy in the archives of the Party, but it is a copy of what you might call the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>official<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> variant, of that variant which was prepared with the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>assistance<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that is to say, with the interference, pressure, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>corrections<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, erasions and additions which Nako, Sejfulla and Ko&ccedil;i made till the last day before the Plenum (Pandi Kristo, as the new member in the Bureau, merely endorsed the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>serious criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> by his comrades, but was capable of no more). Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe delivered the third report with the laconic title <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On Organization<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Then the discussion and debates burst out and continued for two to three days on end. Among the contributions there were some that went on for more than two to three hours, such as the first contribution by Nako Spiru (because he spoke time after time) or

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 184</B></FONT><P>

one of the contributions of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, who like Nako and Ko&ccedil;i missed no opportunity to ask for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>just a minute to make an explanation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and, once he was on his feet, hovered on and on in the Plenum for more than half an hour. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The 2nd Plenum of our Central Committee, summoned to discuss and accomplish very important historic tasks for the Party and for the future of the Homeland and socialism, was turned completely into the opposite of its main purpose. The majority of the comrades of the Central Committee (not including Naxhije Dume and some other) found themselves, to their astonishment and regret, facing a sudden furious attack which struck down and rejected those things which for them were sacred. From the first day, the comrades experienced the same feelings of disillusionment with which I had had to contend for two or three months on end. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The spirit of the reports, especially that of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, not only rejected everything good from the past but, and this was most important, directed and called on the comrades to consider matters and deal with them in their contributions in the same murky light and from that same distorted viewpoint as Ko&ccedil;i himself. I well remember the frowning faces of the comrades and the complete icy silence which accompanied the reading of the reports from beginning to end. Not accidentally, Nako, Sejfulla and Pandi were the first to rise to take part in the discussion and Stojnic <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>intervened<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> a number of times. The aim was to prevent the silence and astonishment of the comrades from turning into the opposite of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>spirit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which was dictated from above. The expected result was achieved. The comrades, disorientated and misdirected, were asked to dig into the past and after this, as can be guessed, many of the contributions followed the course prescribed. Among them there were many correct and balanced contributions, like those of Gogo Nushi, Hysni Kapo, Manush Myftiu and others, but the fact is that a number of members and candidate members of the Central Committee, influenced by the general atmosphere, displayed 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 185</B></FONT><P>

marked vacillations at the Plenum and accepted, some more than others, the theses of the Yugoslav delegate and his spokesmen -- the group of Nako, Ko&ccedil;i, Sejfulla and Pandi! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the circumstances in which they found themselves, we can say that this wavering of the comrades was to some extent justifiable and to be expected. Indeed, the comrades of the Plenum were facing greater difficulties than we members of the Political Bureau faced when Velimir Stojnic issued his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directives<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for the first time at Odri&ccedil;an. At that time, we were facing accusations from delegates of another party and, had those premises and ambitions which I mentioned not existed in the other comrades of the Bureau, we would have come out as a bloc against the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>guest<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and left him with his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the plot itself in his hands. The comrades of the Plenum, however, were hearing the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and accusations not just from some <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>outsider<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but from the mouths of such leaders of the Party as Ko&ccedil;i, Nako and Sejfulla. This new circumstance gave the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and accusations what you might call the official seal. The chief conspirator Stojnic had not wasted his time during the two or three months of his stay in Albania: the vicious plan of Tito and company was now served up to the Plenum of the CC of the CPA, not with Yugoslav hands, but with the hands of the main part of the Bureau of the CC of our Party! This fact gave the Yugoslav accusations greater <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>credibility<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because it cannot be said that the comrades at that time were at such a level as to be able to distinguish quickly and clearly what was true and what was false in the things that were said. More important still, it never occurred to anybody that this was a plot organized behind the scenes for diabolical aims by those who posed as friends and whom we, unfortunately, considered and publicized as friends. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The main accusation, which pervaded the Plenum from beginning to end and the whole period before it, had to do with the <B>political line of our Party.</B> The leadership of our Party and I, in particular, were attacked because allegedly we had been unable to define and pursue a correct line, had 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 186</B></FONT><P>

allegedly fallen from sectarianism into opportunism and vice versa. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to prove this, they presented all the things I described above in the disputes which we had had with Blazo Jovanovic and especially Vukmanovic-Tempo and Velimir Stojnic. The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>new thing<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the Plenum was that these well-known accusations of the Yugoslavs were now presented by Nako Spiru, Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>their own<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as a result of their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>own judgment and evaluation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. This occurred, for example, with Nako Spiru who presented as his own Tempo's thesis that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our Party and its Central Committee were caught unprepared by the founding of the Balli Komb&euml;tar and did not understand that the Balli Komb&euml;tar emerged as reaction against the National Liberation Front<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. The same thing occurred also with the arch-opportunist Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, who, as the self-contradicting fraud he was, accused us of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the Balli Komb&euml;tar during the period when we made efforts to win over the maximum number of nationalists and patriotic elements, especially ordinary people misled by the demagogy of the Balli Komb&euml;tar, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      It is not worthwhile to dwell here on the falsity of these accusations of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but I want to point out one thing: neither Velimir Stojnic nor his followers had a great deal to say about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunist manifestations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunist line<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. In the Plenum they passed lightly over the accusation of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (I shall explain why below), and concentrated all their forces and stress on accusations of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. This was described as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>greatest evil of our Party and its leadership<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the factor which allegedly had hindered and inhibited the development of the Front, the national liberation councils, the organizations of the masses and the Party itself. Likewise, sectarianism was described as the greatest danger for the future, therefore, according to Stojnic, Nako, Ko&ccedil;i and others, accounts must be settled with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarians<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, otherwise neither the Party nor the new Albania would be able to last! 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 187</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, the most perfect embodiment of the classical opportunist that our Party has known, in one of his contributions or interventions went so far as to make the monstrous accusation: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The pronounced sectarianism in the line,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he declared spitefully, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>is turning the Party into a band of terrorists! Our comrades, especially those of the main leadership, have lost the heart of the true communist that treasures human life!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The fact is that many of the comrades who spoke after him, even some of those who were confused and accepted the spirit which was dictated, attacked and indignantly rejected this accusation of Sejfulla's. I myself, both in the Plenum and before the Plenum, had clashed sharply with Sejfulla over this vile accusation. A few days before the Plenum, in the period when he had been co-opted to the Bureau, he came to my office all <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>alarm<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>A great terror is being imposed!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he declared angrily. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Terror?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him in surprise. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Where?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In Tirana!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Many repentant officers are being killed.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In Tirana the great battle for the liberation of the capital is going on,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It's a life-and-death battle. Is that what you call terror? And what officers are you complaining to me about? Now the war is coming to an end,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When we appealed to them to go to the mountains and fight the occupiers together with us they didn't budge from their comfortable shelters. Now they are 'repenting' too late, and we have to settle accounts with the criminals.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Ah! This is sectarianism!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Sejfulla. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You have lost the true heart of a communist who values another man's life and thinks deeply before he decides to wipe out someone who might be corrected and serve the country!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Apparently, he was angry about the well-deserved sentence which the enemy of the Party and communism Zai Fundo received, since he had shared a whole past in exile with this Zai Fundo -- the past of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>caf&eacute; communists<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Apparently, he was also angry about the elimination in the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 188</B></FONT><P>

course of the war of those officers of the former Royal Army who, after their service under fascism, had turned into agents of the Gestapo and commanded the traitor detachments that fought shoulder to shoulder with the Germans in Tirana and elsewhere. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is a grave accusation, Sejfulla, and you'll answer for it,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, of course, I will answer for it!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Sejfulla arrogantly, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I repeat -- our comrades have no idea that a humane international law exists for the repentants and prisoners.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Who has repented and when?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him bluntly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The murderers and plunderers, those who have wallowed in the blood of the people?! Those who, having killed and maimed up to November 15, now on the 16th, that they see their cause is lost, are pretending 'to repent'? No, Sejfulla, for the criminals there are the laws of war and these are the most humane laws.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am not of that opinion!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said the opportunist and went out. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      And there, he found the opportunity and the courage, not only to raise his monstrous accusation in the Plenum, but even to go so far as to call the leadership of the Party <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>terrorist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The other participants in the plot, Ko&ccedil;i, Nako and Pandi, displayed greater <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>caution<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which they presented and from many points of view this was more dangerous, because it was more difficult to discredit and expose them there and then. Indeed, Stojnic himself, when he heard Sejfulla's accusation got up and called it <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advanced<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>hasty<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, indeed <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unjust. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This was a reminder to the others: don't utter nonsense like Sejfulla, because you will discredit yourselves and our plans will be thwarted! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      So Nako, Ko&ccedil;i and Pandi, and also Naxhije Dume and some others, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>confirmed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the sectarianism with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>more believable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> facts: the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarian line towards the Front<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 189</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarian stand towards Ali K&euml;lcyra, Bazi i Can&euml;s, Cen Elezi,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> etc. Above all, a powerful <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>argument<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the hands of the plotters was the notorious sectarian actions of Liri Gega and Mehmet Shehu. Many of the comrades who were acquainted with the distorted sectarian actions of these two, brought out new facts and this sufficed to attach the label of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to the line of the Party and its leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      However, as for all the other accusations, the truth was quite different. Just as the line had not been opportunist, it had never been sectarian, either. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Naturally, it would be a deception and self-satisfaction with lethal consequences if we were to think that such dangers did not threaten us, or that such manifestations had not appeared. No, there had been isolated instances, but as soon as we learned of them, as soon as the information reached us, we immediately took the necessary measures to deal with them severely and to prevent them from getting any worse. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Bedri Spahiu got up in the Plenum, too, and to be in solidarity with his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>comrades<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, especially with Sejfulla, amongst other things, said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There has been no lack of sectarianism, because we were inclined in this direction! For example, in Gjirokastra, in 1942 through our sectarianism we closed the doors of the Front to the nationalists. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This was all Bedri Spahiu said about this instance, but he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>forgot<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or, better, did not want to tell the whole truth, because if he did so he would prove that it was not the line of the Party that was sectarian but the distortion which he himself had made of this line. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As I said, one of the elements who caused us the most problems and trouble in this direction was Liri Gega, especially with the many instances of her sectarian stands in Vlora and in the North, where we sent her in June 1944. Wherever Liri Gega went she immediately placed her authority above that of the Party and the Bureau of the Central Committee, asked leave of nobody and did whatever crossed her mind. We had continually criticized her sternly for these 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 190</B></FONT><P>

actions. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe proposed that we should send her to the North. This was not without a purpose. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe wanted to have Liri Gega as far away as possible because he considered her his closest rival who had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>overshadowed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> him and might continue to do so. On the other hand, he was convinced that Liri Gega could not break away from her unhealthy sectarian tendencies and this provided added motives to accuse her of being sectarian and to eliminate her. In fact, in the North she brandished her sectarian sword even more wildly and that is why we summoned her to return to Odri&ccedil;an with the aim that we would thoroughly and finally analyse her actions, which were completely contrary to the line of the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was indisputably true in regard to the political line of our Party, a line which, as I said, had been and remained correct and principled and had never been <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sometimes opportunist, sometimes sectarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as Stojnic, Tito's delegate, and the people wound up by him alleged. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The other accusation which was launched at the Plenum and which completely distorted the truth had to do with <B>the organizational line of the Party.</B> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe presented the platform of this accusation in his report. From beginning to end, this report was an ugly distortion of the truth, filled with grave slanders about the organizational line of the Party, but which in fact went beyond the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>organizational<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> bounds and constituted a support for the accusations against the whole political and ideological line of the Party and its leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this report Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe put forward his hostile anti-Marxist views openly for the first time. From all this mass of accusations and villainous views he expressed, three problems in particular have remained indelible in my mind: the so-called <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>monopolization of the leadership of the Party by three or four people<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>; the role of the intelligentsia in the war, in the Front, in the state, etc., etc.; the role of cadres. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I shall speak about these matters later also, because for four or five years on end we were to run up against them every day and, regrettably, were to suffer great damage, but 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 191</B></FONT><P>

here I want to point out only where these views had their beginning, and why Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe uttered them for the first time at Berat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     According to the things Xoxe read out, it emerged that during the years of the war three or four people had monopolized the leadership of our Party, and he made it <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>explicitly clear<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that these were, first Miladin Popovic, second I, third Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku, and fourth, for a period, Ymer Dishnica; and then, especially, Liri Gega! The others, according to Ko&ccedil;i, had been pushed aside or not consulted at all. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was all a grave slander and was made in direct support of the main accusation against our political line. From this it turned out that the line had allegedly been worked out by three or four people and since the line was described as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>wrong<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> from the start, then these three or four persons were the main ones to blaine for this, and now they should answer for it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, at these moments, Miladin had been recalled, Ymer Dishnica, Liri Gega and Ramadan &Ccedil;itaku had been expelled <I>de facto</I> from the Bureau. Thus, it remained to settle accounts with the one who was still left, with the General Secretary of the Party. According to Xoxe and, after him, according to Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, I was described as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the synthesis of all the mistakes observed in the political and organizational line.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But the fabrication of this so-called four in the leadership was an attack in many directions and done for man aims. It was not fortuitous that Miladin Popovic was listed first among the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>four<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Indirectly, this was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>endorsement<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav thesis that the CPA had not only been created by a Yugoslav, but had been led <I>de facto</I> by a Yugoslav! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     And now it was not Blazo Jovanovic or Tempo that said this, but the organizational secretary of the Party Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe! Obviously, for the Titoites this service of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe's had great value. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At the same time this absurd placing of Miladin Popovic 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 192</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>at the head<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> had the purpose of telling the members of our Central Committee that the General Secretary <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>has been elected to that post for nothing; he has been incapable of leading and has done whatever Miladin told him<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Going even further, the upside down presentation of everything in the line pursued was served up to the members of the Central Committee as a complete <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>argument<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to rise not only against the General Secretary, but also against Miladin Popovic. All that the Yugoslavs needed in regard to Miladin was an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>endorsement<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: that he had allegedly been <I>de facto</I> leader of the CPA! They wanted nothing else positive about him, but on the contrary, they attacked him openly and wanted our comrades to attack him, too. Having sent Miladin back under orders to Yugoslavia, Stojnic now wanted <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proofs<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mistakes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the aim that he would receive <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the punishment he deserved<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. And since they could not say openly, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are condemned because you did not work for our secret plans<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, they would say, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are condemned because in Albania you have been sectarian, opportunist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It is not worthwhile to prove here why what Xoxe put forward in his report was a filthy slander, but I simply want to point out the indisputable truth that, not three or four or even ten persons, but the whole of our Central Committee led our Party and the National Liberation War, jointly with many dedicated cadres around the Central Committee, while Miladin Popovic, who ought to be considered as a comrade of our Party, only assisted to the same extent as each of the other comrades of the Central Committee assisted individually. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    I myself, as General Secretary of the Party, had worked with all my strength to play my role as leader and guide of the Party, had tried to guide the Party and the Movement to direct them on the right course, to nurture the comrades with valuable political and organizational directives and instructions, basing myself on the experience of the Party and on the great assistance I was given by the other members of the Central Committee who led the organizations at the base 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 193</B></FONT><P>

and the National Liberation War all over Albania. This is the place to say that Miladin Popovic grew up along with us. Our Party raised him, just as it raised all of us. He was a truly internationalist comrade, who loved Albania and the Albanian people greatly and on every occasion took a correct internationalist communist stand in defence of the interests of our country and the just stands of our Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Never on any occasion have we permitted the monopolization of affairs and neither have we pushed one or the other comrade aside, but on the contrary, we have done everything possible to engage them to the maximum in work, in action and in leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In his accusation, apart from carrying out Stojnic's instruction, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe at the same time found the opportunity to express his personal dissatisfaction which he had been accumulating for a long time. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Were we to blame for his obvious inactivity?! Never. Immediately after the founding of the Party, when he was elected a member of the Provisional Central Committee, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe was arrested and remained in prison until the end of April 1943. Of course, for this period, both he and we <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>blamed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> only fascism which locked Ko&ccedil;i in a cell and did not allow him to activize himself in the work which we carried out. With the exception of his good, strong stand in prison, during this period Xoxe did nothing else (and could do nothing else), but nevertheless, at the 1st National Conference we did him a very great honour by electing him to the Central Committee, to the Bureau, moreover, as organizational secretary of the Party, more because he was a worker than for his abilities which we had no possibility of knowing, since, as I said, he was imprisoned soon after the formation of our Party. Simply for this reason an honest communist should have been sincerely grateful to the Party forever, and when he was given the opportunity should have repayed and justified the honour and trust which the Party placed in him, with all his might. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe did the opposite. By chance, as soon as he came out of prison, he joined up with Tempo and spent the summer 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 194</B></FONT><P>

of 1943 in his company. This was where the decline of Ko&ccedil;i began. Worked on by Tempo he stood aside, shut himself away somewhere in the villages of Kor&ccedil;a and turned into a quarter-master behind the lines. Are we to blame for this?! Whenever we held meetings and discussions we summoned him, informed him about everything, sought his opinion, but he contributed nothing. He had nothing to contribute for the benefit of the work, while to the detriment of the work he accumulated <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and petty grievances and awaited the opportunity to pour them out. Several times on end I personally had pointed out to him that he should display more activity, more initiative, should assume more responsibility for the various matters according to the function he had, but he just listened in silence. In particular, I was concerned by the fact that he was not properly carrying out the task of organizational secretary of the Party, and all of us saw this. Liri Gega, with her thirst for power, did everything possible to take over this task, indeed, she even managed to convince Baca and, to some degree, Nako Spiru, too. We were in Helm&euml;s in May 1944, when we were preparing for the 1st Plenum of the CC of the Party. At one moment Liri and Baca came to me and Liri openly put forward the proposal that the question of the organizational secretary of the Party <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>should be thoroughly examined<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>? I asked her. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Because Ko&ccedil;i cannot do it! He is completely out of his depth!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> she told me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We must help him,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Moreover, several times we have instructed you, in particular, to help him.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, I can do that no longer,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Liri. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am to do the work and he is to be called secretary! That is not good enough. Either he should do the job or we should find some remedy for this.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What remedy have you in mind?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked her. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Either he should do the job properly or we should remove him and replace him with someone else.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I understood from the outset what she was getting at, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 195</B></FONT><P>

but I had not thought that she would be quite such a shameless careerist. I egged her on further: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Who have you in mind?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked her as though I were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>very interested<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Well, some active, militant, vigorous comrade. . . Shule,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp195">1</A>]</FONT> for example.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     She mentioned the name of Shule in such a low voice that it could hardly be heard. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us put your ideas before the Bureau,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why in the Bureau?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> she objected. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There are three of us here. I have talked this over with Nako and he said to me, 'Put it to Enver.' So, this is the Bureau!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Never!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What do you take us for? You haven't the remotest idea about the organizational matters of the Party, although you pose as the most 'expert' in this field. Whether we are three or five members of the Bureau who happen to be together and discuss as the whim takes us, this will not and cannot be considered a meeting of the Bureau. A meeting of the Bureau must be held, the question must be put forward in the presence of Ko&ccedil;i, we must discuss it thoroughly and make the truth clear there. Do you understand. . . ?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I understand!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> she said in a faint voice. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In the first meeting after this conversation Liri put forward her <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proposal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the conviction that it would be approved. She presented the matter from the aspect that Ko&ccedil;i had not been active, had withdrawn and shut himself somewhere in Kor&ccedil;a, etc. Liri was right in this, but she said everything from a personal position and with careerist aims. However, she did Ko&ccedil;i over properly. We, too, made our criticisms of Xoxe over those things which he deserved. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe hung his head and said nothing. He stood up and made a self-criticism in the Bureau and amongst other things he said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is right! I have worked in isolation and have not done what the task required of me.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 196</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If you are not capable of performing your task, then say openly that you are not fit to be in the Bureau!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interjected Liri Gega. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I can do it better than you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> retorted Ko&ccedil;i. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But you detest me!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I detest your inability!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Liri attacked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I intervened immediately to cool their tempers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Nevertheless, on my insistence we rejected Liri Gega's proposal and Ko&ccedil;i was advised to put his whole heart into his work, to acquaint himself thoroughly with the problems and to prove himself in the course of his work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      With his eyes on the floor he murmured something, thanked us for the trust we had in him and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>assured<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us that he would show himself to be active. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Three or four months after this, Velimir Stojnic arrived and the formerly invisible Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe emerged on the scene, began to move, became <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>active<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, opened his mouth and now, here in the Plenum, he stands up and spits on the truth, complains that we had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>pushed him aside<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, without considering it necessary to say one word about why he had dropped into idleness and out of sight, that is, why he had stood aside from the war and the work for months and years on end. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Then who else had allegedly been pushed aside, according to the thesis of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Only the person who had been closer to the Bureau than all, Nako Spiru. I could never have imagined that such an absurd thing could be said, but the fact is that not only Ko&ccedil;i, but also Nako himself got up in the Plenum and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I did not know that I was in the main leadership of the Party!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      A downright lie! I have spoken in detail in my book of memoirs, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When the Party Was Born<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, about what place Nako Spiru occupied in our leadership. I only want to say that at those moments my eyes were dimmed with anger, because if there was one person who, right from the outset, had taken part in all the meetings of the Central Committee and the Bureau, who knew all the details, who was better informed 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 197</B></FONT><P>

than anyone else, who had frequently spoken in the name of the Central Committee and the Bureau, and indeed, had even taken decisions on their behalf, without preliminary consultation with us, this was Nako Spiru.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp197">1</A>]</FONT> And now he tells us, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I did not know!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I blamed Nako's ambitious spirit, the moment of unclarity and blindness which had overwhelmed him, his mean tendency to carping criticism. But I could not understand why Nako Spiru denied everything, denied the truth, his comrades and himself. I still did not know that he was implicated up to his neck in a plot behind the scenes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This then was the truth about Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe's slander that allegedly the work of the leadership of our Party had been monopolized in the hands of three or four people! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     His other <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conclusion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that allegedly only the intellectuals predominated and ran things in our Party, and on this account, the Party had allegedly lost its proletarian character, was equally unfounded. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From what Ko&ccedil;i said it seemed that only the intellectuals had waged the war, they filled the Front and they had formed the councils! This was absurd. True, our Party had done good work and had won the support of many progressive and revolutionary intellectuals, but the fact is that these intellectuals played that role in the war that the intelligentsia led by a communist party of the working class could play. The working class and the peasantry bore the brunt, the main burden in the war and, indeed, from the numerical viewpoint, the countryside supplied the overwhelming majority of our fighters. In our whole line throughout the war, in meetings, consultations and conferences, we had always firmly stressed the proletarian character of the Party, had always made the greatest efforts to ensure that the Party was pro-

All the correspondence of Comrade Enver Hoxha published in Volumes 1, 2 of his Works, as well as the unpublished correspondence, testifies to the very close links which Comrade Enver Hoxha and the leadership of the CPA maintained with its member Nako Spiru.

letarian, not only in its ideology and program, but also in the composition of its ranks, and to ensure that workers took first place among the new admissions, followed by the vanguard elements of the countryside and that they should be elected to the leading organs of the Party and the war, etc., etc. Not only had we worked out these directives correctly, but we had also striven to ensure that they were applied correctly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe knew these things, but he launched his accusations for ulterior motives: proceeding from the fact that he himself had been a worker, a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proletarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as he said (but in fact he had been a petty-bourgeois tradesman), he wanted to open the way to emerge at the head of the Party to become its <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chairman<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proletarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he was! He insisted strongly that Stojnic's accusation that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the political line had been wrong<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> should be accepted and, according to Xoxe, this had come about because the Party <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was based on the intellectuals<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that they had made <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>endless mistakes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and were not capable of guiding and leading and that, finally, the Party was a party not of intellectuals but of proletarians and should be led by a proletarian, etc.! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i put this accusation forward at Berat allegedly in a principled way and many could accept it as a correct presentation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, there was one person who could not be pleased with what Ko&ccedil;i said and who was to react against him immediately. This was Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova. These two, together with Nako as the third, were a group, an orchestra at Berat but within this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of conspirators there could not fail to be quarrels, feuds, and the usual contradictions of every kind. When Sejfulla took the floor on this problem he propounded a whole theory to us about how <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a party should be built and advance<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and went on immediately to speak about the need for a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chairman<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (allegedly he presented the problem in principle) who should be very knowledgeable, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>should have Marxism at his fingertips<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and be capable of manoeuvering in any situation! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, he twisted the problem in such a way that Ko&ccedil;i 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 199</B></FONT><P>

broke out in a cold sweat. The two partners in the plot were already trying to draw each other's teeth. We who knew nothing about what had been hatched up behind our backs, could not understand the sudden antagonism which emerged between them, but they themselves each sensed the threat of the other. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, Sejfulla was for a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>party chief<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, knowledgeable and of a high level, for a theoretician, and here he had himself in mind. Ko&ccedil;i was for a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proletarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> without much <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chatter<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theory<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a person with discipline<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! And here he had himself in mind. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The aims of each of them, put forward as if in <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>principle<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> at Berat, were to burst out a little later in a fierce quarrel, in a tooth-and-nail fight for power between the two. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Equally implicated with them in the plot at Berat was Nako, and Ko&ccedil;i's views about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proletarianization<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the leadership of the Party and about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>intellectual elite<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were bound to conflict with the views of Nako as the intellectual he was. Later we were to see that endless mutual quarrels and accusations were to break out between them, too. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As became clear later, the plot of Berat bore the seeds of internal contradictions and struggle for the plotters themselves. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The problem of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>cadres<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe's other weapon to attack the former line of the Party. According to him the Party had done <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>little or nothing<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to promote cadres, and the existing cadres were, according to him, either <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unsound intellectuals<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>incompetent<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in work and in war. According to Ko&ccedil;i the work of the Party with cadres must be radically changed, a reorganization must be carried out, concrete measures must be taken, etc., etc. There for the first time we heard the declension of the noun <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>kadrovik<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>* in all its cases. According to Ko&ccedil;i, a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>trusted<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> person must be appointed everywhere for the work with cadres and he should have a monopoly of it. From the party cells at the base up to the centre, the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>kadroviks<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> would be linked with one another in 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 200</B></FONT><P>

a hierarchy up to the topmost level, the main <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>kadrovik<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the CC. This would be Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, for the time being as organizational secretary of the Party and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in charge<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the work of security! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The aim was very subtle and, like the term <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>kadrovik<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the whole system of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>selection and promotion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of cadres was not the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>product<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the shallow mind of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. No, someone had dictated it to him, someone had taught him. Very soon it was to emerge that this was the work of the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friends<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Seeing that it was impossible for Ko&ccedil;i to take the place of the General Secretary of the Party at Berat, they elaborated the scheme of cadres and of kadroviks. Ko&ccedil;i, as organizational secretary, was to take the monopoly of cadres into his hands. By also taking over the tasks of minister of internal affairs according to the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>model<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Ko&ccedil;i would be able more easily to reject the former line on cadres as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>wrong<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, would put the security force above the Party and would have a free hand to begin the purges and the replacing of cadres with those who would serve the plans of his and his masters. This would enable them to create the conditions to remove the General Secretary and Ko&ccedil;i would take power in a terrain long prepared. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Such was the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>invisible<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> plan, all the threads of which contrived behind the scenes were to be brought to light by subsequent events and circumstances. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From many viewpoints Ko&ccedil;i's report ought to be called the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>not report!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Party did <I>not</I> have a correct, organized line, was <I>not</I> in order, the Front did <I>not</I> work, the councils did <I>not</I> function, the Youth were <I>not</I> led, the people were <I>not</I> awakened, the women were <I>not</I> organized, the councils did <I>not</I> enjoy authority, did <I>not</I> enjoy sympathy, did <I>not</I> play their role, did <I>not</I> and did <I>not</I>. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After rejecting all our work and sacrifices, Ko&ccedil;i saw fit to place before us the experience of the Yugoslavs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He praised Tito, Tempo and Stojnic to the skies as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mo-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 201</B></FONT><P>

dels of justice<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our saviours<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, praised to the skies their experience which <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we must adopt as quickly as possible<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and he continued: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Those things which have not been done here, the Party and councils in Yugoslavia are doing. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> After going on and on about this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>experience<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, he ended up: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That is the great difference which exists between our councils and those in Yugoslavia!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     What was the reason, according to Xoxe, that the councils of our country <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>had not gone well<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>? It came as a shock to hear him, but this is what he said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As a result of the sectarian line of the Party, the national liberation councils are looked on as party cells. In this way, as we have proceeded,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he concluded, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>there is a danger that state power will remain in the hands of the Party.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Such absurdities seem truly unbelievable but we heard all this at Berat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     While rejecting everything, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe tried to produce some <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theoretical<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> argument in his report and in one instance even brought up the experience of the Russian revolution of 1905! This astounded us. Ko&ccedil;i, who did not even know the first thing about the October Revolution was now telling us about that of 1905?! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The truth is that someone had dictated the report to him. This was self-evident from the absolute negation of everything, a negation which could not have emerged from the stupid head of Ko&ccedil;i alone. This was obvious also from its wording. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe's Albanian was hard to understand. In fact, it was a translation from a Serbian text, a bad translation in which arrogance and the desire to dictate were apparent in every two to three words. This could not be the arrogance of one person, even the most negative person, such as Ko&ccedil;i was in reality, it was the arrogance of a group, of a bigger force. As to what this force was, at that time I could only suspect that the hand of Velimir Stojnic and Nijaz Dizdarevic was behind it. But I was even more convinced that someone else had dictated to Ko&ccedil;i while he 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 202</B></FONT><P>

scribbled those 15-20 pages when I noticed that in their euphoria and haste to attack everything, the secret authors and their tool, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, had overlooked self-exposing phrases. When he was speaking about the Party, its role in the war and the need for a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>more prudent policy<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Party in the Front, Ko&ccedil;i read the following phrase: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Party must not emerge in the forefront and you should not worry that you might suffer damage. In this war, you have built up great authority and this authority cannot easily be lost. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Even I blushed when I heard this and after Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe finished reading and sat down, I turned back the pages of his report to the relevant place and asked him: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Who do you imply by 'You'? To whom were you speaking at this point?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Ko&ccedil;i's face went red. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You. . . , that is, we, the Party, the leadership.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Oh, we!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said in a sarcastic tone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why, from what position are you speaking to us, from outside the Party?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It was just a slip,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said shaken. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>See, a bit further down I say 'we must. . .'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Clear, clear,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said and laid the pages on the table. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What do you mean, 'clear'?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I mean you have made the matter clear to me,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied curtly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I'm afraid you might misunderstand me. In fact, I'll cross this piece out.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> And I saw him put a stroke of his pen right across the page. Indeed, he thanked me for the attention I had paid when he was reading! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After two reports, as I said, many of the comrades, some of them worked on and deliberately put in support of Ko&ccedil;i, Nako and Sejfulla, and some others misinformed and deceived, asked scores of questions, seeking clarification of the problems presented. Confusion and disorientation pervaded the whole Plenum. It is interesting to note that very good comrades, like Gogo Nushi, for example, concerned about the situation created, but with communist honesty, threw light in the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 203</B></FONT><P>

Plenum on what had been done behind the scenes. Right from the outset Gogo said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Up until the Plenum at Helm&euml;s we had an extraordinary sympathy for the comrades of the leadership and for Miladin Popovic, while from the report it turns out that they have hindered us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then why this completely unexpected turn?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Gogo explained this there and then: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>From the Congress of P&euml;rmet on, every time I have talked to Nako he has said that 'things are not going well'. A few days ago, Nako told me: 'I had understood the mistakes but had said nothing because I was afraid'.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     So this is what had gone on! Nako, Ko&ccedil;i and Sejfulla had not been content with their pressure and accusations exerted in a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>narrow<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> circle, in the Bureau, but had worked on the others, too. There and then a series of suspicions arose in my mind. What impelled Nako in his actions?! How did it come about that he began to tell Gogo that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>things are not going well<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the autumn of 1944, on the eve of Liberation, and did not do this earlier? As is known, from January 1944 Nako was in Tirana, he had daily contact with Gogo and the two of them led the organization of the Party there and both of them were among the main cadres. Then why did this Nako, who claimed that he had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>all those criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, tell Gogo about them now, on the eve of the Berat Plenum, and did not do this before, when they were working together?! The most elementary logic shows that Nako had not talked with Gogo earlier, because earlier, that is, before the summer, he had no criticism to make, had no differences either with the leadership of the Party or with me or with Miladin. As the impulsive and irritable type he was, he had no reason to keep his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticisms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> secret and save them up for the autumn of 1944. Automatically, my mind went to the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friend<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> who sat at the head of the table energetically taking notes. Once he arrived everything began to be turned upside down, especially after the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>platform theses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which he presented at Odri&ccedil;an. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 204</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After Gogo sat down, Nako got up again to make a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clarification<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is true I have said those things to Gogo. My position has been unclear, but I had not seen matters with these eyes with which I see them today. This would have been to my credit, but it was not so. Comrade Stojnic opened our eyes. Now Gogo has raised here that I was afraid to speak out before. This is a misunderstanding. What I did tell him was that if I spoke out it would bring no result. I thought it would do more harm than good.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The things Nako said on the many occasions when he spoke during the Berat Plenum constitute perhaps the most accurate reflection of his contradictory character. His whole stand there was more negative and hostile than on any other occasion previously or later. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This was that same Nako who, a little while earlier, wrote articles and letters in his incisive style and spoke to the youth with enthusiasm, as he had done no longer ago than August 1944 at the 1st Congress of the Anti-fascist Youth Union of Albania at Helm&euml;s. All his present <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>negations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> until a few months ago had been affirmations, given unreservedly about the correct line which our Party had followed on all problems -- in regard to the councils, the Front, the Women's organization, the Youth organization, the organization of the Party itself and its leadership, etc. This he did because he based himself on the reality which he knew well, on deeds, on events, and on people who were his comrades. Now everything was turned upside down. That Nako who, until a few months ago, spoke and wrote with the greatest hatred about the Balli Komb&euml;tar and reaction, about Abaz Kupi, and so on, had now lowered his bugle and it had faded right out. Astonishing, more than astonishing! Had I not known Nako intimately for years, I would have thought that he had spoken in the past from hypocrisy. But no! While he was speaking, the conviction grew on me that something had occurred with him, something profound had unexpec-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 205</B></FONT><P>

tedly made him go over to the other side. What was it? What was hidden behind Nako? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I was convinced that if Nako had ever been guilty of lying and deceit, this was precisely now, at Berat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Another fact, too, shows what a living contradiction Nako Spiru was in himself and on what a filthy course he had set out. After denying, rejecting and distorting everything, suddenly, when he began to refer to the most recent facts and events, especially to the liberation of the country, the creation of the government, the basks which emerged for us, etc., he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>forgot himself<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and became another Nako, the former Nako: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The people<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>have seen our Party as the banner-bearer of the war. We raised the people to their feet, we brought them to this point and now, through our work, the people have to see that the Party will be the main force of national unity after this, too. This is the issue. The main factor which set the people in movement has been our Party. The people achieved the victory in the National Liberation War because they had our Party at the head. We are in leading positions, we are in command. Now the thing is that we must hold on to these positions. New situations have been created, hence we must remain in these positions and strengthen them.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This was one Nako. Another Nako got up in the Plenum of Berat. Right from the outset, in the Plenum, as a member of the plot, he vented his spleen, made many accusations, threw mud at the Party and its leadership and at his own work and efforts in the bloody years of the war. And even while he spoke, while he continued with his accusations, from time to time, unconsciously, when he was referring to facts, the situation and the tasks which emerged, he unwittingly <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>divested himself<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the dirty role of conspirator and came out in opposition to himself, to what he had just said. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As I mentioned, one of the most mature and balanced contributions to the discussion at the Plenum was that of Comrade Hysni Kapo. Naturally, Hysni could not come out openly against that spirit which, you might say, was the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 206</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>official<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> predominant spirit in the Plenum, but he did not come out in favour of it as many others did, consciously or unconsciously. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When he spoke about the work of the Party in the Vlora region, Hysni concentrated on the flagrant mistakes of Liri Gega and Dusan Mugosa. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Liri's sectarianism and the monopolization of the work by her and Dusan Mugosa,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Hysni, among other things, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>were flagrant and we have had many problems and contradictions with them. We have informed the leadership of the Party about these things and on no occasion have the comrades of the leadership said that we were not right. On the contrary, when the cup was full, the leadership of the Party removed both Liri and Dusan from the regional committee of Vlora.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Hence, Hysni's contribution proved that neither our line nor our directives were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but that the actions of individual persons had been sectarian. This could not be pleasing to Stojnic and company, so Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova got up and wanted to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>catch<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Hysni Kapo out in what he said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I have two questions for Hysni,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said in his doctoral tone, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>first, if after the Winter Offensive we had not had a sectarian stand towards Sk&euml;nder Mu&ccedil;o, do you think he and his men would have come over to us?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Hysni gave him a clear-cut answer: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Sk&euml;nder Mu&ccedil;o clearly understood the aim of our war, he was opposed to the line of the Communist Party and that is why he did not come over to us and never would. But,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> added Hysni with clever sarcasm, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>with the spirit in which this discussion is taking place, he might have come. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>My second question is this,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Sejfulla discomfited: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Did the directive, which the Central Committee issued at the 1st National Conference for the condemnation of Xhepi<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT>, cause harm?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

Sadik Premte, former vice-chairman of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Youth<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Group. Together with Anastas Lulo, former chairman of this group, he strove to hinder the creation of the Communist Party of Albania. Failing in this, [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 207. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] later they continued their divisive activity. In June 1942 the Extraordinary Conference of the CPA expelled them from the ranks of the Party. In April-May 1943 he and some of his collaborators organized a dangerous faction in the Vlora region, which was crushed with the direct intervention of Comrade Enver Hoxha.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Had we allowed Xhepi to do what he wanted, he would have done a great deal more harm to our work. Our mistake is that we had not sufficiently unmasked and attacked him earlier, even before the Conference,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Hysni. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At this Plenum Velimir Stojnic did not leave his work to be done only by the persons that he had prepared thoroughly for two or three months on end. During the whole meeting he sat there serious and frowning, but his face beamed and his eyes sparkled when Ko&ccedil;i, Sejfulla, Nako and others did their work in the way that the plan of Tito and the leadership of his party he had brought from Yugoslavia required. As soon as he saw that the discussion was taking a course which was not to his interest, however, he immediately intervened arrogantly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This occurred for example when, after the allegations about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism in line<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the attack was concentrated on what was described by Ko&ccedil;i and Sejfulla as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clique in the leadership<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Velimir Stojnic was all satisfaction, anticipating that the attack would fall upon me, but the comrades of the Plenum did the opposite. They concentrated their attack on Liri Gega and immediately after her, on Dusan and Miladin. Velimir approved the attack on the latter with a nod of his head and the dose of the criticism was strengthened. As I said, Hysni made a very good portrayal of the sectarian and terrorist characteristics of Mugosa. Other comrades brought up further facts. Tuk Jakova thought that now it was a free-for-all and began to speak about Blazo Jovanovic: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Blazo contributed nothing at the 1st National Conference, because he had nothing to contribute,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Tuk. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If we asked him something, he dodged it or did not open his  mouth. Tempo came those days, too, and he told us nothing

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 208</B></FONT><P>

about how a Central Committee is organized, what the tasks of the Bureau, the Secretariat are, etc.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Tuk spoke at length about these two and the truth is that what he said was correct. However, the naive mind of Tuk had understood nothing of what was going on. He had not understood that the task was not to attack the Yugoslav delegates, but that, in the first place, I had to be attacked, the other comrades of the leadership had to be attacked and, of the Yugoslavs, only one, Miladin Popovic, had to be attacked. The others had to be praised. This is what the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>spirit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Plenum required, but Tuk did not understand this, just as others did not understand it, either. From the facts the truth was emerging: the Yugoslav delegates had not brought us any benefit. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Velimir Stojnic stood up and in a brutal way tried to defend the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>honour<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav delegates: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is not a Plenum about the work of our comrades,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Stojnic sternly, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but about your work, the work of your main comrades. You should speak about them and not about Comrades Dusan, Blazo, Tempo or me.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      He intervened in this way both earlier in the Plenum and later, but he reserved most of his anti-Albanian spleen for the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>message of greetings<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which he delivered at the Plenum. In the Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPA he behaved and spoke in such a tone as if he were in a meeting of a party cell of a battalion of the Yugoslav army. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      His whole contribution consisted of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>platform<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which he presented to us at Odri&ccedil;an, but now <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>further enriched<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and with many things said more openly, more <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>boldly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Thinking that his purpose was virtually achieved, from his own mouth he brought out many facts which compromised him and proved that everything that was occurring had been hatched up by him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      From the outset he accused me because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I refused to call the Bureau of the Central Committee together<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for the gentleman in question <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to present his views<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. In fact, as I have said above, I did not consider it correct or in order for a foreign comrade to take part in the meeting of the Political 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 209</B></FONT><P>

Bureau. It was a different matter with Miladin. We ourselves had asked him to come and he never imposed himself on us, never spoke in the tone that Velimir Stojnic used or acted as he did. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Dizdarevic and I,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he declared boastfully to the Plenum, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>came from Yugoslavia with instructions that we should assist you in all questions of the Party, the army, the youth, the Front, etc. I came with a prepared plan and now I am presenting it to you. I know the situation here in detail. I have not sought to know it because I am inquisitive, or to interfere in your internal affairs, or to infringe the authority of anyone. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp209">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     So frequently did he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>vow<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was not interfering<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was not lowering the prestige of anybody<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., that the repetition of such declarations over and over again implied that he had come precisely for this sinister work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reported<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> openly to the Plenum his dissatisfaction with Miladin and me, stressed that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>when we came, your comrades disregarded us and maintained contacts more with Miladin than with me, who came in the capacity of the instructor of the CC of the CPY,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we quarrelled over many issues,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the stand of Miladin made my work and meeting with comrades difficult, therefore I demanded his withdrawal from Albania,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The work amongst the youth has changed,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Velimir Stojnic. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Dizdarevic quickly found a common language with the comrades of the youth and has proceeded in complete accord with them.<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> In the Party, however,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he complained, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I could make no progress. It was hard to make headway. Thus, all my efforts to take the situation in hand quickly went for nothing. Only after the meeting of the Bureau (he was referring to the meeting at Odri&ccedil;an), where

it was agreed that I should take part, matters started to get under way properly! At that meeting I put forward a number of directives which I'm presenting to you here.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     What these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directives<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were we already know. But why did Stojnic consider it <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reasonable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to repeat them once again, one by one, in front of all the comrades of the Plenum?! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Perhaps I am mistaken, but I have always thought that Stojnic, as a conceited person and none too intelligent, considered that he had achieved everything he wanted, that our Party had been subjugated, and now he ought to tell the whole Central Committee that the true author of all this change, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the hero of the change<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, was not the group of gallants -- Nako Spiru, Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and others, but Velimir Stojnic himself. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The thing was,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said in his discourse, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that the leadership of your Party had to be shaken up to this situation until it could achieve a meeting like this. Your Party was incapable of doing this shaking up itself. This required a force from outside and this force has come here with us!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp210">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The monstrosities of this person were incredible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Supporting Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova's accusation that we had allegedly <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>lost the heart of the communist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Stojnic went even further and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>instructed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The head of the man is not like the head of a rooster on the block. The head of the man has a great role. It is born and dies only once.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In my book of memoirs <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Anglo-American Threat to Albania,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I have spoken about the attempts of the British to bring about a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reconciliation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reuniting<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the National Liberation Front with the agent of the British Abaz Kupi in the last period of the National Liberation War<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT>, as well as

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 211</B></FONT><P>

about the hostile aims that were hidden behind these attempts. After the British got nowhere with us, they chose Tito as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>intermediary<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to bring about this reunion. It is known that they conducted many negotiations with Velebit, the representative of the Yugoslav staff attached to the Allied Headquarters in Cairo, so that he would transmit the request of the British to Tito.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp211">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     What was discussed and achieved in these negotiations between Tito and the British I do not know, but one thing is indisputable: as soon as Velimir Stojnic arrived in Albania he put pressure on us to display <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>prudence<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and accept reconciliation with Abaz Kupi and his men, because otherwise the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the people would be damaged and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>civil war<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> would break out. At that time the British, too, had presented the same demand for the same <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reasons<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! This was not just a coincidence. Tito had accepted the role of intermediary, a role which willy-nilly put him on the same footing as those who wanted to sabotage our National Liberation War and put the victories achieved at the cost of bloodshed into the hands of reaction. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Hence, Stojnic carried out the instruction of Tito and the British as soon as he arrived, but while his demand was lost in the course of the discussion at Odri&ccedil;an (we did not keep minutes of the discussions there), as though to enrich the documentation for the future, he raised the problem at Berat, too, so that it would be recorded into the minutes. His words at Berat, both on this problem and about everything else that he said are down in black and white. He said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Your line with Bazi i Can&euml;s has not been correct. This line was not in favour of the broad unity of the masses, but has brought division and, as is known, division means civil war!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And who was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticizing<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advising<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a line in favour of the unity of the masses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and about avoiding causing <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>civil war<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>?! Precisely those who in their own country, especially in Kosova and the other Albanian regions in Yugoslavia, were pursuing a profoundly wrong anti-popular policy of oppression and division. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I mentioned above our action in sending some units of our army to assist in the liberation of Kosova and the peoples of Yugoslavia in the hot pursuit of the nazi beast. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The entry of our forces into Kosova once again confirmed the patriotic vitality and undaunted revolutionary spirit of the people of Kosova. What the Tempos and others had been deliberately saying for years on end about the people of Kosova describing them as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>linked with reaction<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was quickly refuted. From valiant Kosova, especially after the entry of our forces, 53 000 young men and women filled the ranks of the brigades of the National Liberation Army of Albania and those of Kosova. Although young partisans, they distinguished themselves for their bravery in the war against the nazi-fascists, just like the older partisans. The entry of our brigades brought about that the state power of the national liberation councils, comprised of the finest patriotic sons of Kosova, was extended over the whole province. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, precisely when the whole of Kosova had turned into a hotbed of the National Liberation War, suddenly an order came from Tito's staff that the partisan forces of Albania and those of Kosova should leave Kosova and pursue the nazi enemy <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to the north<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Kosova, deep into Yugoslavia. Our forces carried out this order, because they had gone there to pursue fascism until the complete liberation of the peoples of Yugoslavia. But later we were to learn that the purpose of Tito's order about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the pursuit of the enemy in depth<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was nothing but an almost precise repetition of that trickery which the kraljs and princes had tried to carry through in the past in the fight against the Ottoman yoke. Especially when they saw clearly that the Ottoman forces were being routed and Albania was on the eve of independ- 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 213</B></FONT><P>

ence the kraljs of Serbia and the princes of Montenegro left nothing undone so that the Albanian insurgent forces should leave Kosova which was liberated and engage themselves as long as possible in the pursuit of the Ottoman forces in other regions <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to the south<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Their aim was that the Serbo-Montenegrin armies could occupy Kosova and other Albanian regions without meeting the resistance of the Albanian insurgent forces, or even of the Ottoman occupation forces. This is precisely what Tito was doing in 1945. The Titoite forces entered Kosova, liberated by the forces of our army and the Kosova forces, in order to eliminate the national liberation councils that had been set up and to launch the unrestrained mass terror against the Albanians. These unprecedented reprisals of the Titoites quite rightly caused a great popular revolt which put the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>new Yugoslavia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in doubt, because the people of Kosova were not seeing any difference from what they had suffered under the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>old Yugoslavia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. In this extremely difficult situation the patriotic people of Kosova demanded <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the return of the Albanian partisans<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, with the aim that the situation should be resolved justly and the savage terror stopped. In order to avoid the further complication of the situation Tito and company were obliged to agree to this demand, and the partisans returned. No kind of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>organized reactionary<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> forces, such as the Yugoslav propaganda talked of, were found in Kosova, but a people who welcomed our partisans exactly as if they were carrying out a second liberation of Kosova. Calm was re-established and after this Tito planned new manoeuvres. Now that the war was over, in the new situation he could solve the acute problems in Kosova with his own forces. However, in order to do this, far from the eyes of the world, and especially far from our eyes, it was necessary that our forces should be finally withdrawn from Kosova and return to Albania. But how? The direct withdrawal of our forces from Kosova over the then state borders would create unpleasant, perhaps grave, scenes for the Titoites. The people of Kosova might rise in revolt again when they saw that the forces of our army 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 214</B></FONT><P>

were withdrawing. To overcome this situation Tito again copied the kraljs of the past and staged <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the need to pursue reactionary bands towards the south, towards Greece<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and for this he sought the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of those forces of ours which were there. We, who still did not understand Tito's filthy plans, ordered our divisions to act. After they reached the southern most borders of Macedonia our forces were told that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>there was no further need<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for them to stay in Yugoslavia! The border was crossed in the zone of Kor&ccedil;a and Prespa, far from the eyes of the people of Kosova. Tito and Rankovic were left free to operate, as they did, with their barbarous methods against martyred Kosova. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     These, then, were the people who were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advising<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us on a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>correct<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> line which would lead to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the unity of the masses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Those who, with their policy, were carrying out and planning to deepen the line of genocide and mass extermination in Kosova and the other Albanian regions in Yugoslavia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But let us go on with Stojnic's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>address<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> at the Berat Plenum. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After he threw mud on all our work and successes, after he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>scared<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us, claiming that our <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>positions in the terrain and the army<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were not strong, he did not forget also to teach us a series of other <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>lessons<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for the future. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't deceive yourselves,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that you have strong positions. You must bear in mind, amongst other things, that you are threatened by the overthrown bourgeoisie, but you are also in great danger from the external enemies. You must understand,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he threatened, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that you are small and constitute no more than an easy prey for reaction.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After dwelling at length on the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theory of the danger<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he came to the point he had been told to make: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What I mean is,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that you cannot go ahead without Yugoslavia and, in particular, without the Yugoslavia such as this which now has been created in the Balkans and in Europe. This is a question of the strongest possible relations with us, of whole-hearted links with Yugoslavia,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Stojnic. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 215</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Later I shall speak more extensively about the all-round hostile efforts of the Titoite leadership to realize its ultimate aim: the gobbling up of the whole of Albania. In 1947 and the beginning of 1948, in particular, this aim was proclaimed openly, but I want to say that as early as the Berat Plenum Stojnic launched the idea of this gobbling up as a <I>ballon d'essai </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp215">*</A>]</FONT>: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As to the form in which our relations should be strengthened,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we cannot tell at this Conference. But let us keep before us the prospect of an alliance, a confederation, or even more. Build your relations with Yugoslavia to this perspective,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he dictated. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The perspective of Yugoslavia is the perspective of the Balkans and Europe. The name of Tito has gone beyond the borders of Yugoslavia and you must popularize it, too. My opinion is,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said concluding this question, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that you speak very little about us, therefore in the future you ought to speak more about Yugoslavia and Tito<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     That was not the place, nor were the conditions suitable, to enter into discussion and seek clarification about what Stojnic meant with this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>confederation, or even more<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and how this Yugoslavia had become <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the perspective of the Balkans and Europe<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Everything would be made clear later. At Berat the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>ideas<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directives<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which Stojnic had brought from Yugoslavia were only thrown in; separately or all together, they constituted time-bombs with incalculable dangers for the future of our Party and the new Albania. They were all political and ideological time-bombs and bore the Titoite brand. It was still too early for us to be able to understand the full extent of their danger. But at those troubled moments their clocks began to tick as a great menace. In order to give us no opportunity to think at greater length about the essence of his declarations about Yugoslavia and the alliances, however, Stojnic made a complete about-turn and came back to what was the main thing for the moment: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Here you made your criticism of the Central Committee, 

<A NAME="fnp215">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
* test ballon (French in the original).
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 216</B></FONT><P>

but it should have been stronger and more profound, especially the self-criticism. You must take this criticism in the same spirit down to the base, too, so that the whole Party will be orientated correctly. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In broad outline this was the whole content of the Plenum which was being held in Berat when the capital, Tirana, had just been liberated and the liberation of the whole of Albania was expected hour by hour. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Regrettably, even in this crucial situation and these conditions, most of the aims of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were achieved. A great deal of mud was thrown at our Party and its correct line in crooked ways and with profoundly hostile methods. The unity in the leadership of the Party, especially in the Bureau of the Central Committee, was attacked and severely damaged. Besides Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and Pandi Kristo it was decided that two other <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Sejfullas<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> -- Bedri Spahiu and Tuk Jakova, should be added to the Bureau and it was proposed that later Kristo Themelko should join the Bureau, too, if <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>necessary<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! In the book <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When the Party Was Born<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I have spoken about who they were and what they did during the war, and later I shall speak about what they did after the war, too. Here we are dealing with the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>fruits<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Berat. Nevertheless, one of the main aims of Stojnic and his agents was not achieved at Berat: they were unable to eliminate me from the leadership of the Party and as General Secretary. Although the comrades of the Plenum were disorientated and accepted many unjust accusations, the fact is that they supported the correct general line of the Party, and towards me expressed what they felt: affection, respect and trust. Nevertheless, my authority, not as a person, but as General Secretary of the Party, was diminished by all the poison that the Stojnic gang spewed out. I myself saw and felt this more than anyone. But I did not hang my head. Even when the filthiest things were said, I was convinced that we had a correct line and had the unshakeable conviction that eventually everything would be cleared up and put right. Above all I had the communist conviction that, however things went, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 217</B></FONT><P>

I would be able to stand close to the Party and the people, and leave it to them to give their final correct judgment about everything. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, the bitterest and most damaging <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>fruit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Berat Plenum was the orientation given there for the future: since <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was described as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>greatest evil<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>greatest danger<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for our Party, opportunism was given the green light. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was the main reason why the attack on the alleged opportunism in the line was passed over lightly at the Plenum, without going into it deeply with arguments. Everything had been well calculated by Tito's staff. The accusation about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was thrown in just to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>prove<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that our Party was allegedly incapable of defining a correct and consistent line and, then this accusation had no further value for the accusers. After all, they were not really concerned either about opportunism or about sectarianism. They were concerned with the subjugation of our Party and of Albania to Yugoslavia. Therefore, we should not be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>docile<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>obedient<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>humble<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>generous<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> up to the point of sacrificing our freedom and selling out Albania! This was the aim of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stojnic mission<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and, regrettably, it succeeded in preparing the ground for this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In particular, Stojnic's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directives<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about the future policy of the Party in the Front, the national liberation councils and the organs of state power, in the field of the economy, in foreign policy, etc., constituted that infected anti-socialist mire in which Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and company would try to immerse the new Albania immediately after Liberation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We had had long bitter arguments over these problems, too, for two to three months on end and in one way or another they were included in the reports delivered at the Plenum, but more particularly in some of the contributions to the discussion. I spoke above about the report which I was compelled to read at the Plenum and the open contradictions I had with the comrades over the majority of the matters which they insisted should be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>added<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>corrected<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but I want to point out that my opposition was not entirely in vain. In <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>compensa- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 218</B></FONT><P>

tion,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Nako, Ko&ccedil;i, Sejfulla, and others, headed by Stojnic, were obliged to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>agree<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that some of my correct views and stands should be left in the report. I emphasized these stands with even greater force also in a contribution I made shortly before the closing of the Plenum. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In regard to the policy of the Party in the Front, for example, after speaking about the new situation created in the country as a result of decisive victories in the war, amongst other things I stressed: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We must guard against both the open enemies and the secret enemies. Now that everybody sees that the victory is ours, even the open and declared enemies are trying to link up with the secret enemies and, through them, to get into the Front. Up till yesterday they fought from outside, now they want to fight from inside. However, now it is too late, because our doors are closed to them. The call which we made some time ago to elements who remained on the side of the occupier, was the final appeal. All those who want to avoid their responsibility for the three or four years that they have fought us with arms and every other means, now want to get into the Front. It is our duty,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I stressed, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to refuse to admit to the Front those who want to undermine it from within.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This stand clashed with the view of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>if the doors are closed, the Front becomes narrow<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, therefore, without attacking Sejfulla by name, I asked the direct question: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Does this mean that with this line which we shall follow the Front becomes narrow? No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I stressed, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Front does not become narrow, it will be enlarged with all those elements who, up till now, have stood aside or have been misled by the traitors but who have not stained their hands with blood.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Likewise, both in the report and in my final contribution, I dealt in general outline with some of the future tasks of the Front as a big political organization in which all the masses would be rallied under the leadership of the CPA. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The tasks of state power which the Front has carried out hitherto, will be performed from now on by the councils 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 219</B></FONT><P>

which,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I stressed, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we must ceaselessly strengthen and enliven. The Front must strengthen the alliance of workers, peasants, intellectuals and all other strata. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The question of state power,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>is the central question for the Party, and this not only because it is a current problem facing us, but also because we lack experience in this field. We must strengthen the councils, must purge them of alien elements who have been admitted in error or through machinations, must ensure that the people have complete confidence in the councils and regard them as their own organs of state power.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, although the plotters were obliged to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>permit me<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to present these views, in their contributions they attacked them openly and directly. Thus, when Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova spoke, amongst other things, he stressed: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The time has come for us to open the doors of the Front and to extend it further. Even in Yugoslavia, where there has always been a correct policy on the Front, now the doors are being opened to all, and this is even more necessary in our country where sectarian mistakes have been made. Not only should we extend the Front,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he stressed, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but we should win over those we have lost. Hence, we should accept even those whom we were unable to win during the war<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i, Pandi, Bedri Spahiu and, up to a point, Nako Spiru also spoke in this spirit and on the same lines. The ground was being prepared, for the admission to the Front of the Cen Elezis and Co. The seeds of those evils with which we would have to battle later were being sown in the ranks of the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Another <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directive<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Stojnic which was to cause us many problems and a great deal of work in the future, was that on the stand of our new state towards the allies. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All throughout the war, we had a correct line in this direction and, while recognizing the three <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>great Allies<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, we made the necessary differentiation between the Soviet Union, on the one hand, and the USA and Britain on the other. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At that time, we were still in ignorance of the secret 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 220</B></FONT><P>

and open contacts and negotiations of Tito with the two Western Allies, especially with Churchill, but we noticed something when, in one of the debates before the Plenum, Velimir Stojnic said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Today you are a state with an official policy. The great Allies which played a decisive role in this war, should all be looked on in the same way by the new state. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>By putting the Soviet Union on the same footing with the other two?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>From the state viewpoint, yes,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Stojnic explained to me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The policy of a true state makes no differentiation. You don't know these things but you'll learn them. Naturally,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he added, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in an unofficial way, for example, through party channels, the Soviet Union can be considered as the main and most natural ally, but not through state channels. America and Britain are always allies, and their present policy is positive and in our own interests.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Such reasoning seemed to me astonishing and deep within myself I did not agree. How could the policy of the state be different from the line and policy of the party? Another fact made an even greater impression on me. When Velimir Stojnic told me to stress the special role of the Soviet Union <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in an unofficial way<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, he immediately added: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Here account should be taken of the concrete special features of the war of each country. For example, the true ally of all of us is the Soviet Union, but you, as Albania, have had and still have, you might say. . . ,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he mumbled, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a special, true ally in the Yugoslavia of Tito<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Later the comrades presented these views, too, to me as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>their own<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, we had other argument, and in one way or the other they found their reflection in the Plenum. However, proceeding from the fact that the report was to be delivered to the Party, I took the opportunity and stressed forcefully: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Soviet Union, as the first socialist state and through the heroic anti-fascist war which it is waging, is the greatest guarantee for the liberation and the independence of the peoples. Hence, we must implant in the consciousness of the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 221</B></FONT><P>

masses the truth that our most sincere ally and the main supporter of our foreign policy is the Soviet Union.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Likewise, utilizing my right to make the closing speech, I said to the comrades: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are on the eve of the complete liberation of Albania, we are facing tasks of great importance, and we have no reason to hide our Party, which has been the true leadership of the liberation war, behind the Front. It must be made stronger, more wide awake and more active than ever at the head of the masses, with the reins of command in its hands and, through a correct stand and line properly applied, accomplish its own program and realize the aspirations of the working people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>At this great turning point in the history of our people, we must increase our energies and political perspicacity tenfold, must at the same time confront the Central Committee and the whole Party with the past and future reality, must point out the successes and the mistakes, teach the Party not to become dizzy with success and to learn from its mistakes.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus the Berat Plenum came to an end. The following day we were to enter Tirana. The whole of Albania was liberated, the immediate task which our Party had put in its program when it was founded on November 8, 1941, had been accomplished with success. These were days when our joy and happiness ought to have been greater than ever. And in fact these feelings were seething in the hearts, the faces and eyes of the people, were expressed openly, and burst out wherever we went during those days. I and the other comrades of the leadership of the Party, all the communists, all the fighters of our heroic partisan army were in the midst of this joy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, I cannot hide that, apart from the great joy that we had achieved victory, a great and unpleasant worry about the things that had happened at Berat was gnawing away at my consciousness. It seemed to me that somewhere another great danger for the future was lurking. It was not at all a worry about my future as a person. From the first day 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 222</B></FONT><P>

when I consciously set out on the road of communism I had taken everything into account -- the sufferings, hardships, sacrifices, my whole life. I had dedicated them all to the great cause of the people, the Homeland, the Party and the revolution. My concern was solely about the cause of the Party upon which a great deal of mud was being flung unjustly, about its future and the future of the people and the country which it was to lead. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All that gigantic war had been fought and crowned with success and to jeopardize all this now with our own hands would be a disgrace and a grave crime! This would be the most unpardonable crime committed at the expense of this people. This must never be allowed to occur. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Within myself I swore that I would do everything in my power to establish the truth, to ensure that the Party continued on the right course and that Albania would advance on the road which the CPA had promised in November 1941.

    The new historical stage, which our Party and country were entering immediately after Liberation and the establishment of the people's state power, also marks the transition to a new phase in our relations with the CPY and the Yugoslav state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Now, in both countries our parties were parties in power. Upon them devolved the onerous and noble duty to exert all their strength and abilities both to carry the respective coun- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 224</B></FONT><P>

tries and peoples to new victories and to strengthen and develop the reciprocal relations and links between them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The special difficulties, circumstances and conditions of the time of the war were over. For our part, we found in those conditions and difficulties, understandable in war time, the main justification for why the direct links with the CPY and especially with its leadership during the past four years had remained restricted to some intermittent steps which had not left us with good impressions but, on the contrary, had disappointed us. However, we still regarded these as isolated instances and did not blame the leadership of the CPY for them. Hence, we continued to retain a good, to some extent even euphoric, opinion about the Yugoslav party and its main leadership, even though for four years we had no possibility to know them concretely at first hand. Now the time had come for each of us to assess the other on the basis of real knowledge of the work, facts, and line which each pursued, and no longer through <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>idealist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> judgments, as in the past. The time had come for practice to eliminate any lingering doubt which had remained with us as a result of the restricted and unpleasant contacts of the past, just as any doubt or bad opinion which the Yugoslav leadership might have formed about us on the basis of the reports which its delegates sent, should also be dispelled. Thus, we were ready and predisposed to develop and strengthen to the maximum our friendly relations with the CPY and the peoples of Yugoslavia, being guided in every step by the Marxist-Leninist principles on the relations between fraternal parties and countries. What would the future tell us?!

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The first year of Liberation and indeed the greater part of 1946 in many directions indicated an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Indian summer<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in our relations with the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friends<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. It seemed as if many 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 225</B></FONT><P>

of their former stands were changing, as if there was an improvement in the grave atmosphere of carping criticism of the past, even as if they were reconsidering some of their unjust stands of the past. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Even Colonel Stojnic, after all the chaos and confusion he had caused us at Berat, began to make approaches to me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, what had occurred at Berat hung over us like a black cloud which had not been swept away. On the contrary, its evil effect, great or small, was felt on our work every day. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I said this to Stojnic during one of the many visits he started to pay me after we were settled in Tirana, stressing that for the time being we were seeing only negative effects from the Plenum of Berat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As soon as passions have cooled, you will see that every thing will change,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he tried to pacify me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>At Berat the comrades learned how to make criticism and self-criticism. This is very valuable both for today and for the future.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Except that I have the impression that the criticism was made by throwing mud at the prestige of the Party, its leadership and me,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Please, understand me correctly,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Neither I nor your comrades ever had any intention of disparaging the personality of your Party or even less of you personally. You yourself saw that the comrades of the Bureau never had anything directly against you. On the contrary, they are happy that you are General Secretary of the Party!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Party has elected me to the functions I hold, not one or even five persons,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said with marked coldness. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Likewise, whether or not I am to retain these functions was not and will not be a matter for a few individuals, whoever they may be. Above all we have the Party.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Quite right,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Stojnic and, pretending not to understand what I was driving at, he went on to flatter me: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is an honour for us to have a friend like you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I have never liked flattery and when occasionally someone has flattered me directly, I have tried to divine what was 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 226</B></FONT><P>

hidden behind the flattery and the flatterer. This is what occurred on this occasion with Velimir Stojnic. But he spoke with such an innocent appearance that I found it difficult to understand what had brought about this sudden change in him. Perhaps, I thought, he has sent the Yugoslav leadership a report on what occurred at Berat and Tito has tweaked his ear. Perhaps Velimir himself senses that instead of assisting us with his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he did a lot of harm and now wants to smooth things over with me. Maybe he thinks that in some article or official meeting in the future I might report to Tito about the mess at Berat and, to forestall the consequences, he is trying to behave in a friendly way with me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At the same time I noticed that Stojnic continued to maintain good relations with the other comrades, frequently invited all of us together to the premises of the Yugoslav mission and missed no opportunity to visit us even just to say, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Hello! How are you getting on?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I thought that this, too, came within the context of his efforts to undo some of the harm he had done in the past, especially in the period from the end of August to the end of November 1944. Up till the moment he departed from Albania (as far as I remember, about the end of 1945), he became mostly a distributor of invitations and proposals for us to send the maximum number of individual comrades and groups of comrades of different sectors to Belgrade for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>experience<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nevertheless, I had no use for him at all. Any value he might have had (in fact he had none) he had destroyed once and for all at Berat and now, whether or not he was in Albania, whether he smiled or frowned, these things had no importance at all. I have the belief that Tito and Co. sensed this opinion and quickly withdrew him from Albania. In his place came another Titoite, Josip Djerdja, with whom another long and bitter history would link us. He was a diplomat of Albanian origin, from a village in Dalmatia, and he spoke Albanian freely. His grandfather, if I am not mistaken, had been regent of the Serb or Croat monarchy. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 227</B></FONT><P>

Josip Djerdja was a clever, cunning fellow. He adopted a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>popular<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> pose, approached anybody at all, and in this direction the language helped him, and did a sophisticated job of gathering information for Belgrade. He tried to be correct and friendly with me, made efforts to eliminate the bad impression that Velimir Stojnic and many others had made on me, showed himself <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accommodating<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and with tendencies to advance the work without any further bitterness. Hence, at first Djerdja was sweet-spoken and a real <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>expert<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> on all matters. In a note of five or six lines, Tito himself introduced him to us as a trained cadre who would be ready to help us. At one of the first meetings I had with this new Yugoslav representative, he referred to Stojnic. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The comrades tweaked his ear a bit over some lack of tact in his relations with you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he told me <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in confidence<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but you must understand he was inclined more to military methods because that was his profession.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It was not simply a lack of tact,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied to this Albanian-speaking Yugoslav. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>A whole history came about and is still continuing as a result of the 'criticisms' which Colonel Stojnic presented to us.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Your comrades have misunderstood him. As friends and communists we may make mutual criticisms, but this does not mean that they should be accepted unreservedly.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That is right, but your comrade insisted not only that they should be accepted, but also that they should be made more 'profound'.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Perhaps, perhaps,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Djerdja, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but I have come with the idea that it is better if we don't hark back to the past. At that time the conditions were such that it was more difficult to know the situations and the problems. The main thing is that now we should march forward shoulder to shoulder like friends and brothers.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Meanwhile, other messages of friendship continued to come from Belgrade. Our comrades from various sectors began to come and go back and forth to Yugoslavia and those who met them, especially the officials of the Party, welcomed 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 228</B></FONT><P>

them with friendly words and missed no opportunity to send me greetings and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>assurances<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> between our two parties and countries <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>will be strengthened<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Belgrade will always have its doors open for you<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      All these things, taken as a whole, could not fail to warm our hearts and please us. We ourselves were interested in strengthening our mutual relations, desired, first of all that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the new Yugoslav state should be as strong as possible and in correct positions. Undoubtedly we thought and hoped that we had something to learn from them, especially on the problems of the organization of the new state of people's democracy, in which we lacked experience, on the reconstruction and construction of the country, on the recognition, strengthening and affirmation of our positions in the international arena, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The fact is that the Yugoslav government was the first to recognize our government as a legal government, and it established diplomatic relations with us as early as spring 1945.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp228">1</A>]</FONT> We thanked the Yugoslav comrades for this act and expressed our gratitude to them, although after all, this act was no more than a normal action which should be taken immediately by any government of whatever country which pursues a realistic policy in the international arena. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      We had no reason to welcome or regard the recognition of our government by the others as any <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>favour<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, or <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>special kindness<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> done to us. Our government was more than lawful, it had emerged from the flames of the war. As a result of the heroic and uncompromising fight which we waged against the occupiers and their local collaborators, our government enjoyed the support and love of the whole people, it resolutely expressed and pursued a correct principled foreign and internal policy and knew and defended its rights and duties in the international arena. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Thus, looked at dispassionately or, as you might say, in 

<A NAME="fnp228">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT></SUP> 
The decision of the Yugoslav government on the recognition of the Albanian Democratic government was published on May 1, 1945. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 229</B></FONT><P>

principle, that act of recognition of our government by the Yugoslav government was something quite normal, an action which it or any other government ought to take. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the conditions and circumstances of that time, however, when we were unjustly facing the open boycott and efforts of the Anglo-Americans, not merely to refuse us recognition, but also to overthrow us; when we were still not recognized by the others, etc., the act of the Yugoslav government warranted our respect and gratitude. Moreover, the troubled situation in Greece, as a result of the Anglo-American military intervention, presented a new danger on our southern borders. The Greek government, formed in exile and delivered by the allies directly into the soft seats, immediately proclaimed openly the old pretensions to grab the southern part of Albania. The ancient fable of the so-called Northern Epirus began to circulate through the chancelleries of the Great Powers again and the Greek monarcho-fascist representatives, openly supported by the Americans and the British, launched a furious campaign in international conferences and meetings for a new partitioning of Albania. We raised our voice strongly against this savage and unjust policy which was pursued towards our young state and we ourselves were the fundamental factor and the number-one guarantee that we would defend our lawful rights on the national and international arena, just as we did. The external factors which expressed themselves in our favour had the value of auxiliary, supporting factors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the first place, we saw and found one such factor in the just internationalist policy of the Soviet Union led by Stalin, in the Stalinist foreign policy, which, just as it came to the defence of the interests and rights of all other countries and peoples, great and small, also came to the defence of our just cause. Stalin's representatives supported the new Albania and the order of people's democracy which we were establishing, and at the same time, they exposed the efforts of international reaction, its threats and attempts to interfere in our internal affairs or to deny and trample upon our rights. The 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 230</B></FONT><P>

fact is that at this period the Yugoslav government, too, through declarations or through its representatives, took a stand in defence of our rights and, indeed, it must be said that it proved especially zealous in connection with the recognition and defence of our state borders from the ambitions of others. Later I shall explain what was the meaning of this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>defence<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and why the Titoites displayed such surprising zeal in connection with our cause. Here I want only to point out what was obvious and loudly proclaimed by them in 1945 and 1946, just as it was proclaimed in 1970 and 1980. As far as we knew and could see at those moments, we undoubtedly had every reason to express our gratitude for this aid they gave us and they accepted our gratitude with pleasure and even became annoyed when we did not lay it on thickly, and especially when we did not publish it in the press and mention it in speeches or did not send it to them in writing. I shall explain what was the meaning of this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>habit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of theirs to demand everything, especially good declarations, in writing and especially published in the newspapers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Here I could present a number of other facts and aspects which have to do with our <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>warm<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> relations with the Yugoslavs in the first and second year after Liberation (in this period there was no economic aid to mention), but I think that I have said enough to prove an authentic truth about the so-called <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>period of warm friendly relations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the Yugoslavs. I want to say that for their part, all this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>kindness<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>support<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in essence was only a bluff, a great trick, a trap camouflaged with laurel leaves and olive branches, but which concealed under the leaves the iron teeth of sworn enemies of the Party and of the freedom of our Homeland. In saying this, I have no desire to deny either the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>good<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or the truth, or to misinterpret or to avoid the facts, as the Titoites have claimed and still claim. Our Party has never had this habit and it has never allowed anyone in its ranks to distort even one word from history, let alone the whole of history. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The facts are stubborn. Let them speak for themselves. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 231</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    As the greatest and most <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>indisputable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> aid and support which they gave us at the start the Yugoslavs mention <B>the recognition of our government by them in May 1945 and their efforts in international conferences, etc., to persuade others to recognize our lawful government and the inviolability of our borders.</B> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     To this end, they present <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>facts<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, re-publish statements, reminiscences, etc., etc. Yes, those facts, those statements exist, and we have never denied them. However, the Titoites have always tried to conceal, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to forget<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to wipe out any trace of a series of other facts and arguments, which relate to the same question and occurred at the same period. Concretely: precisely at the time when they were loudly publicizing their recognition of our government, of the independence of Albania, and its inviolable territorial unity, in secrecy, in talks at the highest ranks of the state and party leadership they were hatching up plans for the annexation of Albania and turning it into the 7th Republic of Yugoslavia! As early as the beginning of 1945, one of Tito's closest collaborators, Mosa Pijade, demanded that the new chancellery of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade should have, not 6, but 7 cabinets! According to the Titoites, the 7th cabinet was for the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yugoslav Republic of Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>!<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Someone in present-day Yugoslavia may present this in disputable fact as the crazy whim of Pijade, or as an initial <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>desire<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> or <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>wavering<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of others. This is not so. A little later, in 1946 and, especially in 1947 and 1948, these plans for the annexation of Albania were to be put before us officially, with savage pressure by Tito himself and the people around him. I shall speak about this later. Here my purpose is

</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 232</B></FONT><P>

simply to show the falsity and cunning villainy of Tito and company in connection with their public action of 1945 over the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>recognition<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, the question arises: why did they decide on and proclaim the recognition of Albania, of our government, etc., at a time when they were secretly working out their annexationist plans? Were they hasty?! Did they make a mistake?! Not at all! They were not fools. And to give the devil his due, they have completely proved their ability and cunning, especially in concocting plots and underhand actions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the concrete instance, their tactics was refined and covered many fields. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Tito and company thought (and here they were gravely mistaken) that in one way or the other, Albania was going to belong to them. After Berat they secured the key positions in our leadership, they were aware of and felt our euphoric friendship towards them and thought that they would easily eliminate any remaining obstacle. Hence, they considered that in general the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>internal factor<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was settled. Now the problem was that the annexation of Albania should not arouse debates and problems in the international arena, should never be considered by others as an annexation <I>manu militari </I>*, as a result of war, etc. This annexation, according to them, should be carried out in conditions of peace and bear the brand of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>lawful will<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Albanian state and its legal government. Then they would have no problems. Precisely to this end, as the first step, Albania had to be recognized as an independent state, the new Albanian government had to be recognized as the legal government which expressed the aspirations and desires of the people. When all, and especially the Great Powers, had completed this recognition, then obviously there was no reason why the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>desire<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of a lawful government, recognized world-wide, to unite with whoever it pleased, hence, in the concrete instance with 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>

&nbsp &nbsp 
* through military force (Lat. in the original).
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 233</B></FONT><P>

Yugoslavia, should arouse concern and problems. In this way, the problem of Kosova would be solved, too; the question of attaching it to Albania was not raised, but Albania was to be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>united<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with Kosova within the framework of Tito's Yugoslavia! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was the overriding aim of the Yugoslav government with its act of May 1, 1945. With this it set the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>example<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for the others who should hasten to recognize a legal government in a sovereign country. All the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav government and its <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>efforts<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to influence Britain, the USA, France, etc., to recognize the independence of Albania and its democratic government were for this purpose. Hence, Tito and Co. recognized Albania <I>de jure</I> in order to gobble it up <I>de facto.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All their efforts <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to attack<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the ambitions and pretensions of others, especially of the Greek monarcho-fascists in connection with the partitioning of Albania, are part of this plan. Even to this day, this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of those years is boasted about in Belgrade and, indeed, is used to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>prove<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that the Yugoslav leadership allegedly not only never wanted the annexation of Albania, but helped to ensure that no part of the territory of Albania would be affected by the pretensions of the monarcho-fascists of that time! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the middle of August 1946, when the proceedings of the Peace Conference had opened in Paris, we and the whole international public heard about the forceful denunciation which Mosa Pijade made in one of the sessions of the Conference of the proposal of Tsaldaris<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> for a secret Greek-Yugoslav agreement on the partitioning of Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A few days after Pijade had spoken I went<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> to Paris myself to lead our delegation at this Conference and at our first meeting I thanked Pijade for the stand which he and the Yugoslav government had taken towards the filthy pro-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 234</B></FONT><P>

posal of Tsaldaris. I was together with Molotov at the moment I met Pijade, and he was very pleased with my words, the more so because I was speaking in front of Molotov. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>With their frenzied greed the monarcho-fascist wolves put a major fact in my hands,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Pijade began to declaim in a boastful tone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But I used it and dropped it like a bomb in the Conference!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      When Pijade ended his boastful proclamation Molotov said with quiet good humour: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You gave them just what they deserved! But Comrade Enver was not here those days and does not know the details of how the Greeks came to give you that 'bomb'.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Tsaldaris summoned me to a secret talk,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Mosa Pijade set out to tell me with great relish. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He said to me: 'We have long standing claims towards southern Albania, but you Serbs, too, have claims towards northern Albania. Let us get together and reach agreement on what belongs to you and what belongs to us and finish the business with Albania. It should not exist as an apple of discord between us. Let it be a sweet apple, divided in half by agreement!' They went as far as that!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Pijade, fixing his eyes on us to see the effect of his words. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, yes!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Molotov looking serious, and asked him: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then, what happened about the bargain?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We could not and never will allow them to lay a finger on sister Albania,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> declared Pijade. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That is why I did what they had never dreamed I would do in the Conference.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I thanked him once again for this statement, describing it as internationalist aid and defence from a representative of a fraternal country. At that time, however, I did not know that precisely this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>defender<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the southern part of Albania dreamed of gobbling up the whole of Albania, did not know that it was precisely this Pijade who as early as 1945 wanted to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reserve<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the 7th cabinet in the Yugoslav general chancellery for us! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Hence, in conformity with the secret plans for the annexation of the whole of Albania, Tito's men had no reason not 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 235</B></FONT><P>

to come out <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in defence<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the southern part on which Tsaldaris had his eyes. They believed that things would proceed in their favour and, in this case, why should they allow Albania, the love of their dreams, to be partitioned by the Greeks when they could enjoy the whole of it themselves?! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In brief, the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>defenders<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> did not defend Albania as a free and sovereign state, but defended those territories which, in their secret plans, comprised the southern domain of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>great<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Yugoslav multinational <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>state<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of many peoples which they had dreamed of for centuries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This, then, was the main basis which gave rise to all that zeal of the Yugoslavs for the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>recognition of Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>inviolability<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of its borders. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, in working for this main strategy at those moments Tito and company, at the same time, were also pursuing other aims, through this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>internationalist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> policy of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>defence<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     By emerging in the forefront of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>defenders<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the cause of Albania they were investing capital in the progressive and democratic world to enable themselves to pose as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>champions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the rights of other countries, as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proven internationalists<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as the representatives of a state and a party which nurtured no ambitions for annexation or hegemony. On the contrary, they made world opinion believe that even when others talked to them about agreements and secret treaties to the detriment of third parties (as in the case of Tsaldaris), they not only did not agree, but denounced the annexationists publicly! The purest of the pure! -- that is how Tito's men could be described. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, the game was played in a subtle and dangerous way. This appearance of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>purity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in this initial phase was to serve them as a powerful argument later, at the second step, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to prove<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that in the question of the union of Albania with Yugoslavia there was no sort of plot or secret moves on the part of the Yugoslavs. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Tito and company would defend themselves, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we accepted the unification because this was the desire of the Albanians themselves and we had no 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 236</B></FONT><P>

pretensions at all in this direction. On the contrary, as you know, gentlemen, it was we who came out in defence of the independence of Albania and the recognition of its independence even when others were silent about this or had pretentions to partition it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Many years later, when it had become clear, not only to the Yugoslav chauvinists, but also to everybody else, that in connection with Albania Tito had made his reckoning without the owner, a Greek monarcho-fascist was to emerge again and repeat to the Yugoslavs the act of Tsaldaris in 1946, this time <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>from positions of equality<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. However, this new attempt at negotiations differed somewhat from the former one. This time the participants were of higher rank: the monarch of Greece Paul in person was to make the proposal for the dividing up of Albania to the president of Yugoslavia Tito. Another difference is the fact that this time Tito did not see it appropriate to denounce the proposal even there, t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with the King, let alone in public. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, time has shown and will show what was behind this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>royal joke<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, which was made in Corfu looking across the straights of Albania. But one thing is indisputable: Aesop's famous fox called the grapes which she desired so much <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unripe<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> only when she saw she could not reach them! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As, I said, however, this belongs to a later period, the period when we had long been at daggers drawn with Yugoslav modern revisionism. So Iet us return to the period of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the period when Tito and company <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>defended<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us and supported us <I>de jure</I> in order to gobble us up <I>de facto.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was true of the Yugoslav policy towards us at that time in all other aspects. This was also the aim of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>backing<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>support<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which Velimir Stojnic suddenly began to express to me after the plot at Berat, of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>greetings<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which Tito and company sent me through various people, and of the high Yugoslav decoration which they awarded me in 1946. All these things were done to make us slacken our vigilance, to cover up any doubt about the plot with a curtain 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 237</B></FONT><P>

of rose-tinted smoke, and to strike the blow at us precisely when we did not expect it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As we were to learn later, while they were issuing me <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>certificates<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of trust and gratitude, at the same time the flattering and further incitement of the ambitions of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Nako Spiru and Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova continued, with the aim that they should now carry out what they were unable to accomplish at Berat -- my removal from the leadership of the Party. In this first period Nako Spiru was displaying all his pro-Yugoslav inclinations, but it was to be proved later that the mutual links between Nako and the Yugoslav leadership had no correct Marxist basis. They were links of an agent with his employers. Nako dreamed of becoming general secretary of the Party, and he thought he could use the Yugoslavs in order to replace me, but it was the Yugoslavs who used Nako for their purposes. That vile and perfidious document of Nako Spiru's written secretly to the Yugoslav leadership, in which he used the worst words about me and demanded that my work should be examined, in other words, that they should use their influence to remove me from the post to which the Party had elected me, belongs precisely to this phase. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, the Yugoslavs passed over the request which Nako made to them in silence, apparently because they saw in Nako an element who might cause them problems or upset their plans. They preferred Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. Nako was very hurt but, driven by his ambition, he established new links with  others. The Yugoslavs were to see Nako's new links, but they continued to maintain complete silence about his compromising document. However, in the grave circumstances of November 1947 (I shall speak about them below), Tito's men were to bring this compromising document out of the drawer and to confront Nako with it, as a means of pressure, as a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>weapon<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which, in the grave circumstances created, made Nako kill himself. But this time, too, we were to be told nothing, because at those moments it was in the interest of the Yugoslavs that the circumstances of Nako Spiru's suicide

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 238</B></FONT><P>

should remain the greatest possible mystery for us. Even later, the Yugoslavs were to produce this document again and to publish only some parts of it with the aim of creating the worst possible opinion about us amongst the public. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Such, then, were the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yugoslav comrades<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> who posed as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>pure Marxists<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and whom we, unfortunately, lacking facts and lacking unity in our ranks, continued to consider comrades and friends both in 1945 and in 1946. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Of course, even at this period there were some signs, some indications, minor or major, which could not be concealed and could not make a good impression on us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Groups of comrades, a youth delegation or a delegation of the Women's Organization went to Belgrade on visits or on business, and to our astonishment the Yugoslav comrades mentioned the name and praised the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>merits<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Liri Gega! On one occasion, Liri who had been condemned at Berat had to go to Yugoslavia (I don't remember why or in what circumstances, but no doubt through the intervention and mediation of the Yugoslavs themselves), and the number-two member of the Yugoslav leadership Milovan Djilas accorded a warm, cordial welcome to this person expelled from our Political Bureau and from the Central Committee of the Party on account of her grave sectarian mistakes! They began to put pressure on us to rehabilitate her and Ymer Dishnica, whom we had condemned for opportunism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      What could we call these actions of the Yugoslav comrades?! They made all those accusations against us and built a whole platform, that of Berat, basing themselves on the mistakes and grave faults of these two elements. How, then, did it come about that now they were supporting them and putting pressure on us to re-admit them to the leadership of the Party?! Astonishing! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As I said above, Liri Gega was one of their pledged agents and at Berat the Yugoslavs were obliged to sacrifice her, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to condemn her<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, not because of the damage which she had caused the CPA, but simply because they treated her mistakes as the mistakes of the leadership of the Party, mainly mine 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 239</B></FONT><P>

and Miladin's. After this, it was natural that they should ask us to rehabilitate Liri Gega. As for Ymer Dishnica, the Yugoslavs wanted to rehabilitate him, because they had long been aware of his opportunist and conciliatory tendencies. Such an opportunist in our leadership would be one vote more in favour of the Yugoslavs' secret plans. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Naturally, even though we did not know the meaning of the countless <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>surprises<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslavs at that time, we did not agree to their proposals. It seemed that they were not <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>annoyed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about this and we continued our work, always retaining our respect and friendship for them, but also proceeding cautiously on this course. A series of their stands and views which either increased our doubts, or gave rise to serious suspicions and concern, made this prudence even more necessary. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      In April 1945 a group of militarymen went to Yugoslavia to gain experience in a course or seminar organized with the Yugoslav military cadres. As soon as they returned Mehmet Shehu, Kristo Themelko, Tahir Kadare and, I think, two or three others came to my office and began to describe to me what they heard and learned: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>An analysis of major themes about the experience of the October Revolution and the revolution in Yugoslavia was made,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Mehmet Shehu began to report. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrades Tito and Kardelj personally explained the tactics and the strategy of the Yugoslav party on this cardinal question. In an extremely interesting way and with creative originality the comrades. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, yes,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I interrupted to imply to Mehmet Shehu to get on to the content of the matter, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>what was said concretely?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This conclusion constituted the essence: The Yugoslav revolution did not follow the course of the Russian revolution, each had its own peculiarities. The Russian revolution could not be applied in the conditions of Yugoslavia, therefore the Yugoslav revolution is peculiar and herein lies the merit of Comrade Tito, and our armies should be organized on this basis.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Is this the conclusion which you drew from what you

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 240</B></FONT><P>

heard or the conclusion at which the Yugoslav comrades have arrived?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked very worried. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is the conclusion that Comrades Tito and Kardelj have now arrived at,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Mehmet Shehu. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      At that moment I remembered the debate with Tempo in the spring of 1943 about the same problem. Tempo had served up to us precisely this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conclusion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, this view at that time and I had strongly opposed him, describing it as not right and disparagement of the international value and importance of the Great October Socialist Revolution. At that time I laid the blame on Tempo, while now it turned out that Tito and Kardelj were in the same position. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Mehmet Shehu sensed my disapproval and immediately changed his tactics. He backed away from any further presentation of the new Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>strategies and tactics<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and left Themelko to jump into the murky waters. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Themelko presented all the views expressed by Tito, Kardelj and other Yugoslav leaders. Apart from what I mentioned above, the other views were about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the stages of the revolution<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, on which the Yugoslavs thought that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>since the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution has still not been completed, we shall delay the transition to the second stage, the stage of the proletarian revolution<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>; that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the road of transition from the former to the latter stage is the road of reforms<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>; that the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>national liberation councils are organs of the bourgeois democratic revolution<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>; that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>one of the distinctions between the October Revolution and the Yugoslav revolution is that in the Yugoslav revolution the bourgeoisie is a member, a participant in the front<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>; that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Tito has enriched Marxism with the tactic of the national liberation war<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (!), etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I cannot claim that I had everything clear at those moments, but many of these views seemed to me dubious, even unacceptable, some had a smell of inordinate boasting and megalomania, while others were full of equivocation and fraught with great dangers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Very cautiously I told the comrades that such problems 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 241</B></FONT><P>

are important but extremely difficult, that the Yugoslav comrades themselves are undoubtedly still studying these problems, that the experience of the war and the revolution cannot be generalized immediately and easily, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I say these things to you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told the comrades, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>so that you will be prudent and cautious, both in the talks and lectures which you will give and in our daily work. Then, since the Yugoslav comrades have not made public the things that they told you there, you yourselves should not implicate yourselves in the propagation of the views which you heard. We must consider everything well, must weigh it up and compare it with the teachings of Marxism-Leninism,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I instructed them finally. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In this way we shall learn and shall not permit mistakes.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The generals got up and left, but the things which they told me I was to mull over in my head for a long time. On the one hand, I was worried about the essence of the views expressed by the Yugoslav comrades, about their mania to come out so quickly with major <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>generalizations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and great pretensions to the point of describing themselves as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>enrichers<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Marxism-Leninism! But, I thought, perhaps the initial euphoria after the victory leads them to such hasty conclusions. In time everything would be put in order, the aid of comrades, especially the Soviet comrades, would not be with held, either from the Yugoslavs or from us, to make matters clear to us and help us adopt correct stands. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      My main worry was about our comrades. They were too ready to exalt everything the Yugoslavs said. Of course, we considered Tito and company as comrades and friends, but the tendencies to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>absorb<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> without any reason everything they said did not seem to me correct or communist. This was not the first occasion that I had noticed this kind of euphoric exaltation and subjugation to the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>great<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>powerful<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      At that period Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe had gone to Belgrade on a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>special<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> mission and as soon as he returned he came to my office. Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and Pandi Kristo were there, too. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What honours, what a reception they accorded us!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 242</B></FONT><P>

told me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I can't describe them. Apart from General Marko (Rankovic), Comrades Djilas and Kardelj received me!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He mentioned the names of the latter two in such a tone of veneration that you would think <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>God<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> himself had met Ko&ccedil;i. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Who are they?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him casually there and then, as though I had not heard their names before. Naturally, I knew very well who Djilas and Kardelj were, had no bad impression about them and did not want to infringe their authority, but Xoxe's veneration did not seem to be correct. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i was shocked at my <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>tactless<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> question. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrades Djilas and Kardelj?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said opening his eyes wide to display his astonishment. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They are Tito's greatest brains. They are big chiefs. You might say they are the ideologists of the Party.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Oh!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in surprise<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then, they really are big shots. What did they talk about?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We talked about everything. A little about everything. About the war, the government, security, defence. They spoke well of us. They are going to help us. 'Don't be too hasty in this period,' they told me, 'so that you don't muddle up. . . the advance of the revolution!'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What do you mean with 'advance'?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Well, as they told me, that is, the stairs, the steps. . . ,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> mumbled Ko&ccedil;i. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The stages of the revolution, that's what they told you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla corrected him disdainfully. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That's right, that's what they told me, we must not muddle up. It was a terribly complicated business, but as far as I understood, we shouldn't be too hasty, because for the time being we'll be a democracy for the people, but the bourgeoisie shouldn't be greatly disturbed, because you mix up those, what do you call them, stages.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Never mind, never mind,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interrupted his colleague Sejfulla with open scorn. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is a whole theory, I shall explain it to you some day. But in essence they are right, all my efforts in the Bureau and in the government are in that direction.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We shall see what Sejfulla was driving at with his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 243</B></FONT><P>

terjections<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I was speaking about that kind of unquestioning, blind veneration which a number of our comrades were creating towards the leadership of the CPY, I don't mean that its authority and prestige, or the warm mutual relations of our comrades with the Yugoslav comrades should have been infringed, but when I found the occasion, I stressed that trust and respect should be mutual, and in our relations there should be no creation of the positions of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>big shots<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>masters<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, who know and decide everything, as against the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>little fellows<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>apprentices<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, who ought to sit in silence, listening humbly, and carry out what the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>master<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> says. An end had to be put to this evil. The comrades had to be trained and tempered so that they did not judge things through the head of this or that individual, but according to the line of the Party, taking the reality as the basis, and being guided only by the Marxist-Leninist theory. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, at that period this essential thing could not be achieved. Some of the comrades of the Bureau of our Central Committee had been <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>indoctrinated<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in such a way that they kept in step with the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friends<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in everything and made every stand dependent on the Yugoslav stands. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this way, although apparently standing <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>on the side lines<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and without <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>direct<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interference, the Yugoslavs were ensuring that their plans for the subjugation of our Party and the usurpation of Albania proceeded normally. The Yugoslavs were doing their work with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> hands, through the people whom they had carefully prepared during the war and at Berat and had now thrown into the offensive.

 The secret agents of Belgrade in our ranks

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    After the attack which they made on us at Berat, Tito and company also needed the smokescreen of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>affection<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to cover up any evidence about the true author of the plot at Berat, and to carry their work through to the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 244</B></FONT><P>

end. At Berat they planted the seeds of the destruction of our future, planted them, sad to say, amongst us, in the ranks of the leadership of our Party, and immediately after this, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>withdrew<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to leave the evil which they had planted to develop of itself within our leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      It was not long before their plans began to yield the first results. The fact is that a line, which was not a correct Marxist-Leninist line, was imposed on the leadership of our Party in a hostile way. After the Berat Plenum it could readily be noticed that in our speeches and documents little was said about the Party and a great deal was said about the Front. This was a consequence of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>my sectarian mistakes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> since I spoke a great deal about the Party and allegedly little about the Front. At the same time, they imposed on us the view that we should keep the Party in a semi-illegal situation and maintain secrecy about its existence and its being in the leadership of the whole life of the country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The existence of the Party should be hidden<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> -- this was a consequence of the liquidationist line of the Yugoslavs which had two aims: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      First, to lower the prestige and authority of the Party in the ranks of the communists and the people, and consequently to open the way to the liberal, opportunist spirit in ideology, in the political line, in the economy, in the state power, and in every other sector. All this was done under cover of the anti-Marxist <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theorizations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and distortions in connection with the two stages of the revolution, the period and the roads of transition from one stage to the other, etc. These were also the tendencies of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and the ideas he had brought with him and which now he was to develop rapidly, supported by the Yugoslav mission. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Second, with the hiding of the existence of our Party, the Yugoslavs were striving to prepare the terrain better for acceptance of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>leadership<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the CPY and Tito in our life, as the sole and main leadership, both of Albania and of that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>CPA which had given bad leadership and made so many political and organizational mistakes<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 245</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    At Berat they were unable to achieve their aim of my total liquidation as an important condition for the unrestrained application of their plan and, apparently, they had postponed it for later. Automatically the hopes of the competitors for the same post: Sejfulla, Nako and Ko&ccedil;i, were postponed for later, too. After Liberation they were to do everything in their power to take over the work of leadership completely and to isolate me utterly until they could remove me as unnecessary. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      However, they did not achieve this aim either, because I did not sit idle in the work with which the Party and the state had charged me. The unjust criticisms and attacks did not discourage me or drive me to despair. I had lost neither my courage nor my confidence. I still stuck to my conviction that the Party had had a correct political and organizational line, without mistakes, generally speaking, regardless of some subjective errors. Otherwise, we would not have achieved these victories of such great importance, first of all, the liberation of the Homeland and the establishment of the people's state power. At the same time I fought with the complete conviction that matters had to be put right and suitable situations created to present the issues correctly once again. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As soon as any mention was made of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the re-examination of the past<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, however, the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>comrades<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Berat displayed an astonishing displeasure and anger which, later, was to turn into obvious fear. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Quarrels and rows broke out in the Political Bureau. Obviously, these quarrels did not break out over minor things but, on the contrary, over the major problems which the country, the Party and the state were facing in all fields. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, we entered the new historical stage without a clearly and accurately defined line. This would have been a minor evil and could have been overcome easily if our leadership had been in harmony and predisposed to exert all its united strength to cope with the problems. Precisely this 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 246</B></FONT><P>

essential condition, however, did not exist. After the victory which they scored at Berat, now Sejfulla, Nako and Ko&ccedil;i were not seeking the ways to solve the major problems of the country, but the ways to achieve their own ambitions towards the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>throne<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. On the quiet, each of them aimed to occupy first place. Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, in particular, began to display greater impatience. His great thirst for power, to become <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chief of the Party and the state<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, impelled him to throw off his past laziness and display great zeal. The peculiar, extremely complicated problems which the new situation presented apparently led him to think that the time had come for him to seize the banner. The fact that he had lived in a socialist country, in the Soviet Union, favoured him in this and he posed as if he alone were capable of manoeuvring cautiously in the complicated situation of the new stage we had entered. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In each meeting of the Political Bureau, as soon as the agenda was presented, he would say quite brazenly: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Listen comrades, the problems of the construction and organization of the state, the economy, culture, etc., are very complicated and require a dialectical treatment, without falling either to one side or to the other of the opposites. The Soviet experience of the years after the revolution, which I had the good fortune to live through, convinces us that we must be very manoeuvrable; for example: what about nationalizations, the private sector, the state sector, industry, or agriculture?! Are we going to nationalize everything?! Agreed,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>professor<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>this is the aim, this is the future of socialism! But how are we going to do this? Immediately? Through orders? It could be done in this way, because now we have all the means in our hands. But if we were to act in this way we would not be communists, but sectarians, adventurers! Because not only would neither the big owner nor the small owner understand us, but even if we took the enterprises, the banks and the mines over by force, we would not be capable of making them function efficiently.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 247</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very well,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interjected Ko&ccedil;i, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but what are you getting at? Tell us in plain language.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I'm speaking in plain language, Comrade Xoxe, indeed, I'm explaining Marxism in quite a vulgar way so that you will understand me properly,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> retorted Sejfulla. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On almost all the issues I saw that we were having a great deal of discussion, making a lot of noise and the idea was forming in my mind that this noise was not being made so much on account of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>nature of the problems<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but rather that one and the other was grasping at the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>nature of problems<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in order to realize special personal aims. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When we defeated Sejfulla with sound arguments against his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theories<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about the defence of the private sector, etc., he immediately clutched at Lenin's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>NEP<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and, when here, too, we proved that he was distorting Lenin, he immediately grasped at Tito. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Please! Please!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he protested. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrades Tito, Kardelj and Djilas don't talk for nothing. They themselves are not being hasty and how many times they have advised us not to be hasty. We are in the stage when the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, private property and socialist property will proceed parallel. We must not skip the stages.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We had very long debates during 1945, especially over the major problems of the elections to the Constituent Assembly, how we were to proceed in these elections, what they would represent, what the role of the Party should be in this great political campaign, who the candidates to be proposed to the people would be, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us not forget,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova raising his voice, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that these elections will put the seal on how much the people want us, or more precisely, whom the people are with.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What are you saying?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In the year 1945 you still want proofs of whom the people are with? The people are with the Party, with the Front, with the Democratic Government which we have formed and which is running the country!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are right, indeed, we are in agreement in principle,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 248</B></FONT><P>

put in Sejfulla. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But we must convince everybody, and especially the world, that the people are with us. The votes will demonstrate this conclusively. We must not underestimate what the Anglo-American allies say. Nor must we underestimate the voices of that trend which is crystallizing as an apposition within the Front and which is demanding to take part in the elections independently! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We say that the people are with us. The Anglo-Americans say that this is not so. They say that the people don't want us! We shall defend our viewpoint, but without underestimating or ignoring the voice of the opposition. What I mean is that we must not act as sectarians in the election campaign, but as the vanguard of democracy. And democracy means that we must allow people -- electors and candidates for election, freedom, so they can act freely. We should present our list of candidates, but should allow the opponents, that is to say, those who are not with us, freedom to run their own candidates. In this way we will shut the mouth of reaction which says we have restricted freedoms and have eliminated democracy.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Such a course,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I objected immediately, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>will lead us, not just to an impasse, but to destruction. To allow reaction to come out independently in the election campaign means to accept sharing power with them, that power which we created through bloodshed and sacrifice.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, don't judge the matter so narrowly,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Sejfulla. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This would be only a tactic. The people will see that we are for complete freedom and will link themselves with us even more.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The opposite will occur,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In this way we will disappoint and confuse the people, the workers and peasants, the masses of the poor of town and countryside. When they see in the lists of candidates elements who have sucked their blood in the past, elements who have been alien to the war or have stood aside from the war, they will have the right to think: What did we fight for? To elect such people to the leadership?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 249</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>One moment! One moment!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> shouted Sejfulla as if he had found the famous point of Archimedes. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Logic is leading you to the point. When the people see elements they do not like in the lists, then they will cast the ballot balls not for them, but for our lists. In this way the differentiation will be made and these elements will be isolated! Then we will be able to say to the American and British allies unreservedly: You see, Gentlemen, whom the people are with?! Our victory will be sanctioned.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am apposed to such a policy, however 'broad' and democratic' you call it, Sejfulla,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said bluntly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is falling into sectarianism!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> shouted Sejfulla. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is a return to that line which we attacked at Berat. And I'm sorry to say, Comrade Enver, that I observe with regret that you have still not understood Berat.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I have not understood and never will understand the Plenum of Berat in the way you say,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If sectarian stands and mistakes were attacked at Berat, this by no means implies that now we should go over to the opposite -- opportunism.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Only a sectarian assessment could call this platform, which I present and defend and will defend to the end, an opportunist policy,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> screamed Sejfulla. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let the other comrades speak!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>These matters are not simple, not simple at all,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> put in Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>However, listening to what Sejfulla says and what Enver says, I think that we should be somewhat more balanced. I am not with one or the other, but I put it like this: we have an experience from the time of the 'Puna' Organization of Kor&ccedil;a. When the Comintern sent us the new line in 1937, we took part in the elections as the opposition, presented our lists and the people in Kor&ccedil;a gave us most of their votes. We won at that time irrespective that afterwards the regime threw me and a series of comrades out of office. Here I lean towards Sejfulla. He is right. I hope that the reactionaries won't win anything. If they win, we'll see what we shall do. . . We won't allow them to take power from us. . . 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 250</B></FONT><P>

Then, we have the experience of the Yugoslav comrades. They are not afraid to reach agreement even with the bourgeois, with Subasic. They have him in the government. Of course, that's their affair, we don't interfere, but we should not forget that they have always been patient and generous towards reaction. At the Congress of the Party in Serbia the Yugoslav comrades declared that all the political parties should act freely, that they should have their own newspapers and pamphlets opposed to those of the party, that a struggle should be fought between the two sides through the papers, through speeches and, in this way, the people will be convinced about the freedom which they have won. They do this because otherwise reaction would cause trouble for them. We should learn from them because they are our friends. It is not a matter of a few well-known reactionaries, because I know where to put them, but I am concerned about the allies. We are waiting for them to recognize us and they are not recognizing us before the elections. So I say we should take a broader approach. Let them take part in the elections, but they will lose, because their cause has been lost for a long time. However, I think we should consider what Enver said. I say that we should attack some outright reactionary elements and not allow them to present themselves in the lists, but to allow the others.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am for a cautious and intelligent policy,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Nako Spiru added fuel to the fire. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Ko&ccedil;i mentioned something from the experience of the recent Congress of the Communist Party of Serbia. I've read those materials, too, and there is something to learn from them, especially from the courage of the Yugoslav comrades and their ability to manoeuvre. They are not afraid of the participation of reactionaries in the elections or even of their getting into the councils. 'Even if the elements of reaction triumph in a council,' said the Yugoslav comrades about their own experience, 'we should not throw them out because their election shows that we do not have all the masses with us. We should allow them to run things and, since they are reactionaries, they will not fulfil 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 251</B></FONT><P>

the demands of the masses. In this way they will expose themselves and will be abandoned by the people.' That is what the Yugoslav comrades said,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> repeated Nako, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and I think that this is a bold and clever tactic. We have no reason to fear, either, now that we are in power.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I insist on what I said before,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said speaking again. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrades, you know that after the blow it received, reaction pulled in its horns, but it has by no means given up its aims and never will. It has begun to move, to rally its forces, to create its links and to organize the attack. External reaction, especially Anglo-American reaction, is in support of it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This is not the occasion to dwell longer on the endless debates we held over those cardinal problems at that period, but I only want to point out that from what was occurring amongst us I was becoming ever more worried about a series of things. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     First, I saw that a dangerous spirit and trend of opportunism was making itself felt and Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova was the banner-bearer of this tendency. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Second, the lack of unity of thought and action between us was very obvious. Almost all of us (with the exception of Bedri Spahiu and Tuk Jakova) were involved in arguments and disputes, but I saw that the contradictions of Ko&ccedil;i and Pandi and, up to a point, of Nako Spiru, too, with Sejfulla, were not contradictions of views, but had to do more with side-issues, with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>individual retorts<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc. It seemed to me that the comrades were not so much concerned about Sejfulla's opportunism as about Sejfulla himself, his strutting and posing, as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>incontestable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> authority, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>know-all<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and a leader <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>of the first order<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This situation had to be grappled with and changed. I was even more convinced of this after the conclusion with complete success of the general elections which were organized throughout the country in December 1945. Through their votes the people proved that they were linked with the Party and our Democratic Front like flesh to bone. How- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 252</B></FONT><P>

ever, in the positive general picture there were also some saddening instances. Through the pressure of Sejfulla and the others, in some cases elements that the people detested were allowed to present themselves in the lists of candidates. Reports reached us immediately: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We prefer not to vote at all rather than vote for Riza Dani,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> a group of residents of the electoral zone at which the candidature of this anti-popular element had been proclaimed, said openly. Similar things occurred with others. There were cases when the electors voted for elements they did not like, solely because the Party had told them to do so, but not from their own conviction. I'm referring to elements such as Suat Asllani, Selaudin Toto, Shefqet Beja, Gjergj Kokoshi and others, who were to come out openly later as a dangerous group of enemies in the ranks of our Constituent Assembly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At the same time Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova urgently pressed on with his efforts for the greatest possible opening up and orientation towards the West, for economic links with it, because, according to him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in this way we will advance more rapidly and dispel from the minds of our allies the idea that we violate democracy<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we can do nothing on our own<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our friends (the Yugoslavs) have their own problems<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc. Therefore, according to Mal&euml;shova, our eyes should be directed towards the West. So that they would <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>recognize<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us, in one meeting Sejfulla said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We should re-examine the question of the treaties of the time of Zog with the Americans and the British!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In what direction ?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked in surprise. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In the direction of recognizing these treaties. It will do us no harm if we recognize them!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Sejfulla quite unabashed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That is to say we should reject the decisions of the Congress of P&euml;rmet. Is this what you want, Sejfulla?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked angrily. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't forget, comrades,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Sejfulla, addressing Ko&ccedil;i, Nako and the others, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that the Congress of P&euml;rmet was held 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 253</B></FONT><P>

in the period of sectarianism, before Berat! The decision taken there 'to re-examine', that is, to reject Zog's treaties with the allies seems to me to be a sectarian decision!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I opposed him strongly and indignantly and, to my surprise, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe sided with me, a thing which he had rarely done since Berat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, you are going too far,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How can we reject the Congress which gave us the government? If we do as you say, it turns out that we should link up with America and Britain, but that time is over. As for contacts and friends, now we have others. Are we to recognize the oil concessions to the British and Americans?! This is serious. We need the oil ourselves and our Yugoslav friends are short of it, too!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> concluded Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and angrily slapped the envelope, on which he had jotted down two or three lines, on the table. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't try to put me in a difficult position with the Yugoslav comrades!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla turned to Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We were together when we talked with them and they suggested that we should recognize Zog's treaties with the allies, because it would do us no harm.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What's this, what's this?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked immediately. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When did this occur?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Ko&ccedil;i and I were together with Kardelj and Djilas,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla began to explain, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and we outlined to them the conditions the Western allies laid down for us. They told us that we could recognize the treaties. Let Ko&ccedil;i tell you himself.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't mix up things or involve Comrades Kardelj and Djilas in them,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> retorted Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe with a frown, but with a trembling voice. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We were not talking about Zog's concessions but about the recognition of our government by the allies.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That's what I said,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla snapped back. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, but in the first place, you had more to say than they did. You presented matters in such detail you made a mess of it. You confused me, let alone them. That's how the matter stands. Don't confuse the comrades.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 254</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When you had discussed this with the Yugoslav comrades, why did you not inform us after you returned?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked Ko&ccedil;i and Sejfulla. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is an extremely serious problem.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How do you mean, we have not informed you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla defended himself. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>All my efforts in the Bureau for an intelligent tactic with the allies have been in that spirit. I considered that Ko&ccedil;i had told you the details.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You confuse matters and now you are confusing all of us!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> retorted Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>With all your great theory you are only making a mess.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This, then, was the advice which the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>comrades<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friends<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> gave us! We should reject what we had decided at the Congress of P&euml;rmet, accept everything that the Americans and the British suggested to us and retain the enslaving treaties which Zog had signed with them. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe tried to soften and deny this truth, but 4-5 months later open pressure to recognize Zog's enslaving treaties was to be exerted on us again by the Yugoslav leadership.<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> Of course, we did not submit to these pressures and continued our former stand. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The quarrels broke out again, only this time extremely bitter quarrels and with mutual recriminations between Ko&ccedil;i and Sejfulla. Bedri and Tuk, vacillated as usual, mostly posed as neutral, while Nako Spiru listened, all eyes and ears, and tried to find the most favourable position for him to adopt. The balance leaned in favour of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova was suddenly placed in the centre of the attack. To my surprise, in a number of meetings and discussions that we held at that period, Ko&ccedil;i, Nako and Pandi Kristo 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT></SUP> 
A radiogram which Nako Spiru sent from Belgrade on April 25, 1946 to Comrade Enver Hoxha included the following: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They think that we should recognize the treaties with the Americans under the formula that Albania accepts all the pre-war commitments with other states with the exception of aggressors. In regard to the treaties with America, Kardelj sees nothing of importance, says they can easily be accepted.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> <I>CAP.</I>
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 255</B></FONT><P>

turned on Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova with all their might. They presented a series of new facts and arguments which proved the treachery of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, but also proved some thing else: these facts, which they knew and had discussed with one another, they had kept completely hidden from me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All these things threw light not only on the grave mistakes of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova, which I knew in general outline and had long opposed. The main thing was that new light was being thrown on an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>old<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> mistake, on the Berat Plenum. The time had come to analyse and judge calmly and with maturity and responsibility the things that had occurred. 

<A NAME="s3iii">
<P><BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<B>
The end of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova brings<BR> 
the plot hatched up by the Yugoslavs more to light
</B>

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The dialectic of things was having its way. The plot hatched up behind the scenes at Berat bore within itself, besides the dangers and all the other perils for the Party and the country, the seeds of disaster for the plotters themselves. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At Berat Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Nako Spiru and Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova comprised a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and had been egged on by the Yugoslavs in a joint attack against our Party. The Yugoslavs had done this by nurturing in each of them ambitions to occupy the main post. However, there were three of them and only one post. Hence, the time would come when the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the main anti-party trio at Berat would fall apart. The personal ambitions of each of them would be directed towards getting rid of the other two partners. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The development of events and the interests of the plotters were to bring about that the first pawn to be eliminated! from the game would be Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova. In fact, he had deserved punishment, not only now but much earlier, and it could even be said that his entire promotion to the leadership was a mistake. In that short period of the war that he 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 256</B></FONT><P>

spent in Albania, he showed himself to be an unrivalled coward, and had no idea where and how the fighting and actions were carried out. He was for a struggle of cafes and drawing-rooms, a battle of smart phrases spoken, of course, because it was a great effort and sacrifice for him to write. After Liberation he proved to be a liberal parliamentary democrat, who did everything in his power to impose on the Party a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>broad<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> opportunist line, a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>front without restrictions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in which even the war criminals could take part. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Both during and after the war, Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova demonstrated that he was a friend and supporter of all the politicians of the cafes and the secret chambers, of bourgeois elements, of the kulak strata and reactionary clergy. He was, in fact, opposed to the socialist revolution, opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat in theory and practice. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On account of Sejfulla's endless hostile anti-Marxist stands and actions of this type, we rightly decided to condemn him at the 5th Plenum of the CC of the CPA in February 1946. But the motive for the condemnation of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova was the obvious one, the party motive. I say this because now <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>someone else<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was interested in his condemnation. This <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>someone else<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, first of all, was the Yugoslavs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     They exploited the anti-party tendencies of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova for as long as it interested them and then, when they saw that he was becoming a nuisance to them, indeed with his pro-Western inclinations, he was even becoming dangerous, they agreed that he should be removed from the scene. On this occasion they satisfied mostly the ambitions of their main preference -- Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe With the elimination of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova one competitor of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe's for absolute power was removed. This was the main reason why Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and, together with him, Nako Spiru, smiled their approval and expressed complete solidarity as soon as I put forward in the Bureau the necessity for holding the 5th Plenum. Long afterwards I was to learn the truth that they seized on my demand for the examination of Sejfulla Ma-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 257</B></FONT><P>

l&euml;shova's grave mistakes and faults for other, essentially anti-party, interests and aims. Willy-nilly, on this occasion the Party came <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to the aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Ko&ccedil;i and Nako to remove one of the rival partners from the scene. But, to give credit where credit is due, they themselves, willy-nilly, were to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>assist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the Party with the host of facts which they were to present. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At that time, of course, I did not and could not know the true motives which inspired Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe in the attack against <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opportunism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but I noticed that he was displaying great activity and day by day dug out from the dossiers new <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> against Sejfulla. Nako Spiru did not lag behind in this campaign, either. He continued his old game: through his people he gathered facts exposing Sejfulla and strove to outdo even Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe in the condemnation of the opportunist. At the 5th Plenum these two tried to appear as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the saviours of the situation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Within the sessions of the meeting, from what they said they seemed to be in solidarity with each other and with me and all the comrades of the Central Committee. This seemed to me like a good sign. Perhaps, I said to myself, the moment is coming to strengthen the unity so long desired and sought. Perhaps the comrades are beginning to understand where the orientation which Berat gave us might lead us and now are pulling themselves together. However, I was wrong and the first signs of this and my suspicions about it appeared right there at the Plenum. In their contributions and comments both Ko&ccedil;i and Nako confined all the evil to Sejfulla alone, only to the opportunist, but not to the opportunist spirit and tendency which had begun to appear after the Berat Plenum. Sejfulla was the most advanced, the banner-bearer of this alien anti-Marxist spirit, but if the analysis and criticism were to be concentrated on his person alone we were going to gain nothing. Why had this opportunist tendency entered amongst us? Where did it have its roots, causes, reasons? What factors assisted Sejfulla to flaunt his liberal tendencies so strongly? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Both Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako Spiru glided over or avoided

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 258</B></FONT><P>

these essential questions. I had the unshakeable conviction that everything had its origin at Berat, in the unjust accusations of Velimir Stojnic about the alleged <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarianism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the line of the CPA, therefore, in the report which I delivered to the 5th Plenum I stated the cause of the evil openly. Naturally, in the report and in the remarks which I made I did not criticise either Stojnic or his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directives<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> directly. (Apart from other things, this would have been a mistaken step on my part, because in this way the possibility would have been given to Ko&ccedil;i, Nako and their comrades to attack me as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Yugoslav<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>incorrigible<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc.). However, I cautiously portrayed the mistakes of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova on their true background of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>new<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>broad<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> spirit about which we spoke at Berat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>At Berat,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I stressed amongst other things, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we looked for sectarianism even where it did not exist and the question of sectarianism was raised as the greatest threat to the Party. This was fraught with great dangers because it brought about that a young Party, without long experience, like this Party of ours, leaned over in the other direction, to opportunist stands. Those who lost all sense of measure,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I stressed further on, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>were the comrades who did not base themselves on the experience of the Party and who saw the 'sectarian' tendency everywhere in the past.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This is not the place to dwell at length on the report I delivered at this Plenum (it has been published<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> and in itself is the first re-examination of the Berat Plenum), but I want to point out only that both Ko&ccedil;i and Nako, from beginning to end, avoided such a thorough analysis of things and this struck my eye. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why did they not describe the evil as they should?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked myself. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Can it be that they find it hard to admit that they were wrong at Berat? Why were they so frightened even at the mention of the 'Berat Plenum'?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> My suspicions were growing that they were hiding something.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Another feature which I did not like in the stands of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako Spiru at the 5th Plenum was their mania to present themselves before the comrades of the Plenum as the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>discoverers<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the danger and the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>saviours of the situation.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      In his contribution and interventions Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe praised the role of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>cadres<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he had around him, who, according to him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>had noticed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and brought up the question of Sejfulla's mistakes. After speaking about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>observations of cadres<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Ko&ccedil;i turned on Sejfulla: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he told him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>wanted to convince us that no harm came from your line and you pushed the cadres aside. You have done us great harm. Control has been overlooked. We had no line on control, exercised no control. Control must be re-established. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chief kadrovik<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was preparing to take over the reins, to open the dossiers. Under the disguise of the struggle against enemy elements, who had come <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>under the influence of the opportunist line of Mal&euml;shova<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe was to find ways to extend the line of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>control<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, surveillance, persecution and punishment in all directions, especially against sound cadres in the Party and in the state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nako Spiru, for his part, gave all the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>credit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>youth<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>intelligent comrades with a revolutionary spirit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> who had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>uncovered<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova! He went so far as to openly oppose the youth to the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The comrades of the youth organization,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Nako, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>have shown themselves to be more vigilant than those of the Party in the direction of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova. The youth organization is able to turn out capable cadres who can do any work and solve any problem!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, both the cadres and the youth, educated by the Party, had done and were doing their own work in all fields and the Party guided, supported and assisted them with all its might. But the problem could by no means be presented as who <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>uncovered<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova first, the youth or the Party, the cadres or the Party! Such divisions 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 260</B></FONT><P>

and oppositions were impermissible and dangerous. The mistakes of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova were uncovered by the Party, the working class, men of the people, among them the youth and the cadres. The mania for the divisions <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the youth<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the cadres<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was incorrect and dangerous. Moreover, both in the Plenum and before and after it Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako Spiru regarded and presented the youth or the cadres respectively (with the cadres Ko&ccedil;i implied first of all the workers of the Security Service and then the people of the apparatus) as personal <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sectors<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, where, according to them, not the directives of the Party, but the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>leadership<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Ko&ccedil;i or Nako had a role. At the time of the Plenum we attacked these tendencies (to the extent they were manifested at those moments), but later we were to become clearer about the truth and to have fierce debates and clashes with Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako Spiru. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The mutual dislike and enmity between Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako Spiru was obvious at the Plenum. Although they were in solidarity in the condemnation of Sejfulla, the way in which they condemned him and presented the facts gave the impression that they were waging a kind of contest. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Later, all these things were to come clearly to light and it would be proved that both Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako Spiru did everything in the context of the struggle for personal power. I shall speak about this later. What is of interest here is the fact that at the 5th Plenum one of the most cunning and dangerous enemies was eliminated from our ranks. All the comrades sternly denounced Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and, in one degree or another, it came out clearly that the roots of Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova's mistakes lay not simply in his personal tendencies, in his vacillating opportunist nature. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All these things were true, but the main thing is that, first, Sejfulla's tendencies found a basis for support in the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>orientation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which Velimir Stojnic gave at Berat; second, in the unhealthy atmosphere which existed in our Political Bureau no barrier was raised to and no conditions were created for Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova's crooked inclinations to be nipped in the bud. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 261</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The 5th Plenum completely confirmed this truth. However, I was convinced that we would be hasty if we were to accept the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conclusion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Ko&ccedil;i, Nako, Pandi Kristo and others that allegedly <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>now the evil has been eliminated<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>things will go well<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. No, the 5th Plenum only brought out where the source of the evil lay, cleaned up a part of this evil, but the roots remained where they had been. The wound could become infected again and cause us even greater damage. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This became clear immediately after the 5th Plenum. The first signs of the Ko&ccedil;i-Nako enmity, which had appeared in the second half of 1945, now began to get worse and emerge openly. The development of events was creating new situations: the quarrels between Nako and Ko&ccedil;i broke the isolation they had established around me after Berat; and they began to come to me to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>complain<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to explain the situation and seek my intervention. More and more I was seeing that the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which they presented spoke more about the personal ambitions of each of them than about issues of principle in regard to our work or the line in general. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Of course these ambitions of theirs which seemed sickening to me, had prime importance for them, and the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advance<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of one could not fail to worry the other. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The fact is that after Liberation, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe was rising higher than Nako, although he had neither the culture nor the acumen of Nako. But Ko&ccedil;i was pushed ahead because the Yugoslavs placed importance in the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Macedonian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, encouraged and boosted him, and in their plan it was he who had to become number one. Ko&ccedil;i began to dress as a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>lieutenant general<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and was minister of internal affairs and organizational secretary of the Party, like Rankovic in Yugoslavia. He began to become arrogant, despotic, and posed as the man <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>who knows everything<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nako Spiru watched this rapid rise of Ko&ccedil;i with astonishment and concern. He knew Xoxe's capacities, which were almost nil, and knew the general opinion which we had 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 262</B></FONT><P>

of him, and so he was convinced that Ko&ccedil;i was being pushed ahead by somebody else, by an external force. Nako sensed that the Yugoslavs were leaving him in the lurch and his ambitions were not being realized. From this point, without doubt, began Nako's cooling off towards the Yugoslavs and his orientation towards someone <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>more powerful<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. But about this I shall speak later. At first, Nako advanced in his quarrels with Ko&ccedil;i with the aim of undermining this situation through methods and forms not in the party spirit, but in the spirit of intrigue which characterized him, and with factional work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nako's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>waves<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> began to break closer to me, but not openly and sincerely, not by opening his heart to me and disclosing what he had done, but always using the pretext of current work to criticize Ko&ccedil;i. And Ko&ccedil;i behaved in the same way against Nako. From all this I observed that their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> at Berat was breaking up and the tendencies were for the formation of two groups -- the group of Ko&ccedil;i, Pandi and Kristo Themelko (who after Berat became the Yugoslavs' men<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> completely), and the group 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT></SUP> 
Under the influence of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and the pressure and secret activity of the Titoites, Kristo Themelko, too, after the Berat Plenum joined in the anti-Marxist and anti-Albanian activity of the Belgrade leaders and their agents in Albania. When the Titoite betrayal came to light and the plot which the Yugoslavs had hatched up against the freedom and independence of our country was discovered and foiled, Kristo Themelko admitted his grave faults and mistakes and made self-criticism. With his stand he helped the CPA uncover more thoroughly the secret threads of the plot hatched up by the Yugoslav leadership and its agents, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and company. Therefore, only party measures were taken towards Kristo Themelko (he was dismissed from the Political Bureau, to which he was co-opted in the summer of 1946 and expelled from the C.C. of the CPA) and he was given a helping hand to correct his previous faults and mistakes through his work and correct stand. Kristo Themelko highly evaluated the magnanimous and benevolent stand of the Party towards him and mustered all his forces to honourably carry out the tasks he was charged with in important sectors of the economy of our country. For his good work and stand in a party spirit he was, among other things, decorated by the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the PRA.

of Nako Spiru with his cronies of the youth -- Liri Belishova, Fadil Pa&ccedil;rami and others. As for Bedri Spahiu and Tuk Jakova, up till the end of 1945 they were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>neutral<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, or inclined more towards Sejfulla, and after Sejfulla was attacked, they stayed on the sideline. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile, many other events in this spirit took place before our eyes and when I considered them, they all focussed on one point, on a single source -- the Berat Plenum. So I considered that the moment had come to raise the question in the Political Bureau and that is what I did. As is known, I summarized my opinions on these matters, on the cause and the source of them in a document for the Political Bureau, a document which is known as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Theses for the Re-examination of the 2nd Plenum of the CC of the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp263">1</A>]</FONT>. These theses were published in full many years ago, so there is no need to outline them again. I want only to point out that on this occasion, that is, in the spring of 1946, I put forward the conclusion openly and officially in the Political Bureau that the main author of the grave mistakes of the 2nd Plenum was the Yugoslav emissary, Velimir Stojnic, that all his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directives<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were wrong and our comrades' support for them had brought about all the grave subsequent developments. I considered that pointing out the danger of these actions, which had caused and were causing divisions, was a necessary action on my part to save the Party from a further split. On the other hand, it was essential and urgent to tell the comrades that Marxist-Leninist unity in the leadership did not exist, a thing which endangered the unity of the whole Party and the people, therefore, this unity absolutely must be established in the leadership of the Party and first of all there where it was lacking, in the Bureau. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In a working discussion I suggested my idea to Ko&ccedil;i and Nako; but they jumped straight up in the air.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why should we go into an analysis of past events?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> asked Ko&ccedil;i almost innocently. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Berat was about the war. That time has ended. Moreover, the 5th Plenum put matters in order for the first two years of peace, we have no reason to go into an analysis.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nako Spiru raised the same opposition, the same arguments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I'm sorry,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told them, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but even after the 5th Plenum sharp disagreements are occurring amongst us. You know this better than anyone.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     They both hung their heads and blushed. They did not like it that I brought out openly that each of them was coming to me to complain about the other. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If we have some disagreements they are over daily matters,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe tried to get out of the difficulty. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the way you have presented the matters to me they go deeper than that. Unity is lacking in our leadership and I insist that we must examine the roots of the evil where they lie -- in the Berat Plenum. We must discuss this seriously in the Bureau.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Since you insist, let the three of us, you, Nako and I get together,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There's no reason to involve the other comrades in what occurred at Berat.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     These words made a deep impression an me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Did anything occur there that the others should not know? They were at the Plenum. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They were, but not as members of the Bureau,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Nako Spiru coming to the aid of his rival and enemy. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Better let the three of us discuss the matter.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This unexpected <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>solidarity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of these two, at a time when it was known that they were ready to tear at each other's throats, increased my suspicions. Then I said flatly and sternly: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I shall not permit a second Berat. We are not going to meet alone again to discuss or decide in the name of the Bureau. I'm ready to present my opinions to the Bureau for analysis.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 265</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    They were obliged to agree, but the fact that they were shocked was quite obvious. So I presented my opinions in the form of theses, telling the comrades of the Bureau right from the outset that my main concern was the lack of unity in the Bureau and that we should discuss this to find the causes and improve the situation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At the same time I turned to Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Nako saying: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>My conviction is that everything began from the time when we were preparing for the 2nd Plenum and it was fully developed at this Plenum. That is where we must seek the roots of the evil. Therefore, especially you, Comrades Ko&ccedil;i and Nako, and you Pandi, too, must make clear to us: why did you take a stand opposed to the line of the Party at Berat, why did you criticize the Party, from what positions did you proceed, were you subject to outside influences, and do you still stand by your former opinions?! I do not ask this in order to confront you with your responsibility,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I stressed, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but so that both you and we will be clear, will thoroughly recognize the mistakes, will correct ourselves through bolshevik criticism and self-criticism and radically improve the situation.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After this the discussion began. Both of them put up a stubborn resistance, using the justification that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>at Berat we attacked the manifestations, not the line<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we did not want to distort the past<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>perhaps we went too far, but without evil aims<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I proved with arguments that such excuses did not hold water. I reminded them of the unfair and unscrupulous interference which they engaged in on the report I delivered, but Nako forestalled the evil. He put all the blame on Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That's right, Sejfulla confused us with his theories,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe expressed his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>solidarity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with Nako. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He said that it should be a weighty report and we left this matter to him.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We carried on like this for two or three nights on end, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 266</B></FONT><P>

trying to arrive at the truth, but Ko&ccedil;i, Pandi and Nako Spiru swerved away from every truth. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Both during the years of the war and in this period we held the meetings of the Bureau at night. Mostly we met in my home, isolated one of the rooms which I used for work, and frequently continued the discussion till early morning. The occasions were by no means rare (not only when we discussed Berat, but also before and after this), when the debate took the form of a quarrel and voices were raised so high that not only the people of my household, but also the odd passer-by in the street could hear them. (At that time the street in front of the house where I lived and still live was not closed and anybody, good or bad, could walk past freely.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We had moments of bitter arguments this time, too, only I must point out that Nako, Ko&ccedil;i and Pandi Kristo had lowered their tone to an extent rarely seen before. They were in <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the defensive<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and wanted to get over everything <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>quietly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, like <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>angels<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, to avoid letting anything untoward slip out as tempers rose. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    As usual Bedri and Tuk at first opened their eyes wide in amazement at the things they heard, and then, when they took the floor, did not know whom to support and whom to attack. I remained alone facing the three of them and realized that in such a situation no progress could be made. I proposed that we should extend the ranks of the Political Bureau with new comrades whose words and opinions ought to help to clear up this problem and to change the situation for the better. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>First let us finish this analysis,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and then attend to that. There is no need to involve others in this story.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You can see that without calling in new comrades we are not going to get out of this situation,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied to Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us increase the ranks of the Bureau and have the opinion and judgment of new comrades -- there's nothing wrong with that, it's all to the good.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 267</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The argument broke out again. Ko&ccedil;i, Nako and Pandi were especially opposed to bringing new comrades into the Bureau immediately. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Later, perhaps it can be done,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> they said. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We left the meeting for the next night (it was extremely late), when we were to continue the discussion about my theses and make the proposals for enlarging the Bureau. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The next day, however, everything was suspended: unexpectedly, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>good<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> news reached us from Belgrade. Nako Spiru with two or three comrades, cadres of the economy, were urgently required to examine problems of importance for our country and for Albanian-Yugoslav relations. The Yugoslav mission in Tirana informed us <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>joyfully<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that all measures had been taken: the tickets were ready, the seats in the aircraft reserved. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>All that was required was that Comrade Nako Spiru should leave as quickly as possible!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was pleased, too, but this unexpected news also surprised me. We ourselves had long been seeking talks with the Yugoslav leadership on problems of mutual relations, especially in the economic field, but no concrete reply had been given us. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The comrades are busy,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Josip Djerdja told us. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As soon as they are free they will welcome you. We are friends, we understand each other's problems, so don't worry.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     And now the way was open! And when?! Precisely when we were at the climax of the debates over the re-examination of a grave mistake of the past! What a coincidence! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, it was to be proved that it was not a coincidence at all! The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>kindly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> but <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>withdrawn<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> stand from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>afar<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav comrades had come to an end. Apparently they had been informed about what was occurring in our Bureau. They sensed the danger that the crust of the pie might be opened, that the plot they had hatched up at Berat might be discovered, and they took measures immediately. The first step was the urgent summoning of Nako Spiru to Belgrade. We sent him off the next day or the day after, giving him the relevant instructions, and a few days after he had gone I said to the comrades: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us continue the meeting.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 268</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Without Nako?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i in a shocked tone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, that cannot be done. He's involved in this and must be there to speak for himself. He could complain that we have talked behind his back. As you know, he accuses me for nothing.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very well,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we shall wait for Nako to return and then continue.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Meanwhile from Belgrade Nako sent us good tidings one after the other. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The first thing that Kardelj and Djilas had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advised<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> as soon as they met him was the indefinite postponement of the date which we had set at the 5th Plenum for holding the 1st Congress of the CPA.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82ii.html#fnp268">1</A>]</FONT> <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are still not holding our congress,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the gentlemen had told him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>let alone you who are without experience.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> They had put forward a whole bunch of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>difficulties<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (the preparation of reports and resolutions, what we would put forward, how we would organize it, what we would say about our line, how we would come out: legally or illegally, etc., etc.). and then had said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Wait till we hold our congress, see how we do it, prepare the materials and bring them here for us to look them over, and then decide whether or not you're going to hold your congress. As for the way in which you organize it,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> they had added, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we think that the congress should be held in secrecy, in illegality, to avoid annoying both internal and external reaction! This is what we did with the Congress of the CP of Serbia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I had never been in agreement with such <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advice<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav comrades, but in particular their insistence on concealing the existence of the Party seemed to me a thing as ludicrous and absurd as it was dangerous. However, my opposition in the Bureau ran up against the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of other comrades who, not only repeated the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Kardelj and Djilas, but also <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>discovered<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> others and raised them as

</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 269</B></FONT><P>

a barricade against me in order to have their way. As for the postponement of the holding of the congress, we would have done this even without the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>suggestion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav comrades, but for quite different reasons and motives from those Kardelj and Djilas presented. The congress was going to be postponed because we were still not reaching agreement in the Bureau in order to find the roots of the evil and were waiting for Nako so we could continue the discussion further. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As far as I remember Nako returned from Belgrade in May and meanwhile I had begun to put the ideas which I had presented to the earlier meetings about the re-examination of Berat in better order and prepared them in writing in the form of a report. This was the final variant (the one that has been published) which at the beginning of June 1946 I distributed to the comrades of the Bureau to read and study. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is better this way,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told them. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We must not get lost again in endless discussions as we did the first time. We must all prepare ourselves seriously and speak.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      A few days later the meeting recommenced. Again the earlier pressure, only this time the phrases and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>arguments<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Ko&ccedil;i and Nako were more <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>measured<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, more <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>studied<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, and even contained a little <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>self-criticism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. As the first step this was something. Let us carry further. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      But we could not continue. An urgent radiogram arrived for me. Hysni Kapo, who was our ambassador to Yugoslavia at that time, sent it to me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Marko<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (Rankovic continued to use his wartime pseudonym) had summoned him and had informed him that this time they urgently awaited Enver Hoxha in Belgrade! Now they were only awaiting word from me whether or not I agreed to go <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>at the earliest possible moment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to Belgrade, where they were to give me a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>majestic<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> welcome.<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT></SUP> 
<FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Marko told me,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> wrote Hysni Kapo, among other things, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that it would be good if Enver came as quickly as possible, perhaps on Sunday. Only your opinion is awaited. They will put at your disposal as many aircraft as you need for your trip. They intend to give you a majestic welcome.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (<I>Radiogram of June 19</I>, <I>1946</I>, <I>CAP.</I>) 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 370</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Without doubt the news pleased me and I accepted the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conditions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that is, that I should go <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>as quickly as possible<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Only look -- what a coincidence again and over the same problem: when we put forward in the Bureau the re-examination of Berat for the first time the friends urgently summoned Nako and now, as soon as we started the meeting left unfinished, they summoned me! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, this was not a coincidence, either. Without doubt, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe had again signalled his employers about my insistence and they found the remedy. To ensure that I left <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>as soon as possible<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> they mentioned the names of Tito, Djilas and Stalin himself! Of course, they offered me <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>as many aircraft as I wanted<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a majestic welcome<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> if only I would leave! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When the news reached me I was truly disturbed that an essential analysis would be left half-way through again, but nevertheless I considered my visit to Belgrade a thing of importance for our work, both for our relations with Yugoslavia and on the international plane. So we left Berat unfinished again. In front of us was Belgrade. It was asking for us urgently.
