This introduction to the 'Philosophy Course for Scientists' was delivered in October-November 1967 at the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  At that time I and a group of friends concerned with problems in the history of the sciences, and with the philosophical conflicts to which it gives rise, intrigued by ideological struggle and the forms it can take among the intellectuals of scientific practice, decided to address our colleagues in a series of public lectures. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This experiment, inaugurated by the present exposition and continued by the interventions of Pierre Macherey, &Eacute;tienne Balibar, Fran&ccedil;ois Regnault, Michel P&ecirc;cheux, Michel Fichant and Alain Badiou, was to last up to the eve of the great events of 1968. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The texts of the lectures were immediately mimeographed and soon began to circulate. Later, on the initiative of students, certain of them were even reproduced in the provinces (Nice, Nantes). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  From the beginning we had planned, perhaps precipitately, to publish the lectures. To this end, a 'series' was created in the <I>Th&eacute;orie</I> collection, and in 1969 the lectures by M. P&ecirc;cheux and M. Fichant (<I>Sur l'Histoire des sciences </I>) and by A. Badiou (<I>Le Concept de modele </I>) appeared. For various reasons the other lectures, although announced, could not be published. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is in response to numerous requests that I have today, after a long delay, published my 1967 Introduction to <I>Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  With the exception of part of the first lecture and the critique of Jacques Monod, which I have reproduced unchanged, I have revised the remainder of the text to make more readable what was nothing more than a hasty improvisation and also to develop certain formulae that had not been worked out and were often enigmatic. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But I have, on the whole, been careful to respect the theoretical <I>limitations</I> of this essay, which should be read as a <I>dated</I> work. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I am also publishing it as a retrospective testimony. In it may be found the initial formulations that 'inaugurated' a turning point in our research on philosophy in general and Marxist philosophy in particular. Previously (in <I>For Marx</I> and <I>Reading Capital </I>), I had defined philosophy as 'the theory of theoretical practice'. But in this course new formulae 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 72</B></FONT><P>

appear: philosophy, which has no <I>object</I> (in the sense that a science has an object), has <I>stakes </I>; philosophy does not produce knowledges but states <I>Theses</I>, etc. Its Theses open the way to a <I>correct</I> position on the problems of scientific and political practice, etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These formulae remain schematic and much work will be necessary to complete them and render them more precise. But at least they indicate an order of research the trace of which may be found in subsequent works.

<P>
Our poster announced an introductory course on philosophy for scientists. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I see among you mathematicians, physicists, chemists, biologists, etc., but also specialists in the 'human sciences' and, if they will forgive me, in what are, by convention, known simply as 'the arts'. Little matter: it is either a real experience of a scientific practice or the hope of giving your discipline the form of a 'science' that brings you together, as well as, naturally, the question: what is to be expected of philosophy?
  You see before you a philosopher: philosophers took the initiative of organizing this course, having judged it possible, opportune, and useful.
  Why? Because, being familiar with works on the history of philosophy and of the sciences and having friends who are scientists, we have arrived at a certain idea of the relations that philosophy necessarily maintains with the sciences. Better still: a certain idea of the relations that philosophy <I>should</I> maintain with the sciences if it is to serve them rather than enslave them. Better still: because, as a result of an experience external to philosophy and to the sciences but indispensable to an understanding of their relationship, we have arrived at a certain idea of <I>which</I> philosophy can serve the sciences.
  And since it is we philosophers who have taken this initiative, it is fitting that we take the first step: by first speaking of our own discipline, philosophy. I will therefore attempt, using terms that are as clear and simple as possible, to give you an initial idea of philosophy. I do not propose to present to you a theory of philosophy but, far more modestly, a description of its manner of being and of its manner of acting: let us say of <I>its practice.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Hence the plan of this first lecture. It will consist of two parts: 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 74</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   1.&nbsp;A 'putting into place' of basic notions, culminating in the statement of twenty-one philosophical Theses.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   2.&nbsp;The summary examination of a concrete example in which we will be able to see the majority of these Theses exercise their proper philosophical 'function'.

This lecture will begin with the statement of a certain number of didactic and dogmatic propositions. These adjectives, I am quite aware, do not have good reputations, but that does not matter: we must not give in to either the fetishism or the counter-fetishism of words. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Didactic</I> propositions: for no lecture escapes the circle of pedagogical exposition. To give an idea of a question, it is necessary to begin and hence first to give apparently arbitrary definitions which will only subsequently be justified or demonstrated. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Dogmatic</I> propositions: this adjective pertains to the very nature of philosophy. Definition: I call dogmatic any proposition that assumes the form of a <I>Thesis.</I> I will add: 'Philosophical propositions are Theses' and therefore dogmatic propositions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This proposition is itself a philosophical Thesis. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Hence <I>Thesis 1.</I>&nbsp;Philosophical propositions are Theses. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This Thesis is stated in a didactic form: it will be explained and justified later, as we go along. But at the same time I specify that it is a Thesis, that is, a dogmatic proposition. I therefore insist: a philosophical proposition is a dogmatic proposition and not simply a didactic proposition. The didactic form is destined to disappear into the exposition, but the dogmatic character persists. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We have straight away touched a sensitive point. What does 'dogmatic' really mean, not in general but in our definition? To give a first elementary idea, I will say this: philosophical Theses can be considered dogmatic propositions <I>negatively</I>, in so far as they are not susceptible to demonstration in the <I>strictly</I> scientific sense (in the sense that we speak of demonstration in mathematics or in logic), nor to proof in the <I>strictly</I> scientific sense (in the sense that we speak of proof in the experimental sciences). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I then derive from  <I>Thesis 1</I> a <I>Thesis 2</I> that explains it. Not being the object of scientific demonstration or proof, philosophical Theses cannot be said to be 'true' (demonstrated or proved as in mathematics or in physics). They can only be said to be 'correct' [<I>justes </I>] . 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 2.</I>&nbsp;Every philosophical Thesis may be said to be correct or not.


<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 75</B></FONT><P>

What might 'correct' signify? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To give an initial idea: the attribute 'true' implies, above all, a relationship to theory; the attribute 'correct' above all a relationship to practice. (Thus: a correct decision, a just [<I>juste </I>] war, a correct line.) 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us stop a moment. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I am simply trying to give you some idea of the <I>form</I> of our lecture. Being a lecture, it states didactic propositions (which are justified later). But being a lecture on philosophy, it didactically states propositions that are necessarily dogmatic propositions: Theses. It will be noted that in so far as they are Theses, philosophical propositions are <I>theoretical</I> propositions, but in so far as they are 'correct' propositions, these theoretical propositions are haunted by <I>practice.</I> Let me add a paradoxical remark. An entire philosophical tradition since Kant has contrasted 'dogmatism' with 'criticism'. Philosophical propositions have always had the effect of producing 'critical' distinctions: that is, of 'sorting out' or separating ideas from each other, and even of forging the <I>appropriate</I> ideas for making their <I>separation</I> and its necessity visible. Theoretically, this effect might be expressed by saying that philosophy 'divides' (Plato), 'traces lines of demarcation' (Lenin) and produces (in the sense of making manifest or visible) distinctions and differences. The entire history of philosophy demonstrates that philosophers spend their time <I>distinguishing</I> between truth and error, between science and opinion, between the sensible and the intelligible, between reason and the understanding, between spirit and matter, etc. They always <I>do</I> it, but they do not say (or only rarely) that the practice of philosophy consists in this demarcation, in this distinction, in this drawing of a line. <I>We say it</I> (and we will say many other things). By recognizing this, by saying it and thinking it, we separate ourselves from them. Even as we take note of the practice of philosophy, we exercise it, but <I>we do so in order</I> to transform it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Therefore philosophy states Theses - propositions that give rise neither to <I>scientific</I> demonstration nor to proof in the strict sense, but to <I>rational justifications</I> of a particular, distinct type. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This Thesis has two important and immediate implications:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;Philosophy is a discipline different from the sciences (as the 'nature' of its propositions will suffice here to indicate).

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;It will be necessary to explain and justify this difference, and in particular to think the proper, specific <I>modality</I> of philosophical propositions: what distinguishes a Thesis from a scientific proposition?

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  From the outset, we can see that we have touched on an important 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 76</B></FONT><P>

primary problem: what is philosophy? What distinguishes it from the sciences? And what makes it distinct from them? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I will leave these questions to one side. I simply wanted in two Theses to give you an initial idea: what might these philosophers who are speaking to you be thinking of? A few preliminary words were necessary. But if we were now to get acquainted?

<P>
You scientists did not come here to hear what I said a moment ago. You did not really know what to expect. You came for different reasons: let us say out of friendship, interest, curiosity. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us leave aside friendship and all that might pertain to the comforts of this place: the &Eacute;cole Normale. You came out of curiosity and interest. Difficult feelings to define. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I do not believe I am wrong, however, in saying that your interest and your curiosity centre around two poles: one negative, the other positive. And that whilst the negative is well defined, the positive is rather vague. Let us see.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
<B>
1.&nbsp;The Negative Pole
</B>

<P>
Let us be good sports. Philosophers at work! It is well worth going out of your way to have a close look at such a spectacle! What spectacle? Why, comedy. Bergson (<I>Le Rire </I>)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp">1</A>]</FONT> has explained and Chaplin has shown that, ultimately, comedy is always a matter of a man missing a step or falling into a hole. With philosophers you know what to expect: at some point they will fall flat on their faces. Behind this mischievous or malevolent hope there is a genuine reality: ever since the time of Thales and Plato, philosophy and philosophers have been 'falling into wells'. Slapstick. But that is not all! For ever since Plato philosophy has been falling within its own realm. A second-degree fall: into a philosophical theory of 'falling'. Let me spell it out: the philosopher attempts <I>in</I> his philosophy to descend from the heavenly realm of ideas and get back to material reality, to 'descend' from theory and get back to practice. A 'controlled' fall, but a fall nevertheless. Realizing that he is falling, he attempts to 'catch' his balance in a theory of falling (a descending dialectic, etc.) and falls just the same! He falls twice. Twice as funny. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us be good sports. Philosophers make a lot of fuss about nothing. They are intellectuals without a practice. Far removed from everything.

Their discourse is nothing but a commentary on, and a disavowal of, this distance. They try, at a remove, to grasp the real in their words, to insert it in systems. Words succeed words, systems succeed systems, while the world continues its course as before. Philosophy? The discourse of theoretical impotence on the real work of others (scientific, artistic, political, etc., practice). Philosophy: what it lacks in titles it makes up for in pretension. This pretension produces beautiful discourses. So: philosophy as pretension will figure among the fine arts. An art. We are back to the spectacle. This time it is dance: dancing so as not to fall. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Yes, we are going to fall flat on our faces. Note that scientists (like all men engaged in a real practice) can also fall flat on their faces. But they do so in a particular way: when they fall, they calmly register the fact, ask themselves why, rectify their errors and get on with their work. But when a philosopher falls flat on his face, things are different: for he falls flat on his face within the very theory which he is setting forth in order to demonstrate that he is not falling flat on his face! He picks himself up <I>in advance </I>! How many philosophers do you know who admit to <I>having been mistaken </I>? A philosopher is never mistaken! 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In short, your air of amused curiosity masks a certain comic and derisive idea of philosophy - the conviction that philosophy has no practice, no object, that its domain is but words and ideas: a system that might be brilliant, but which exists in a void. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   You have to admit that even if, out of politeness, you refrain from saying so, you do derive a certain pleasure from entertaining such ideas, or at least analogous ones. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Well, I will say right away that for my part I endorse <I>all these ideas </I>: for they are neither gratuitous nor arbitrary. But I will, naturally, take them up, in the form of <I>Theses</I>, for in their way they are philosophical and contribute to the definition of philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 3.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy does not have as its object real objects or a real object in the sense that a science has a real object. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 4.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy does not have an object in the sense that a science has an object. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 5.</I>&nbsp;Although philosophy has no object (as stated in Thesis 4), there exist 'philosophical objects': 'objects' internal to philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 6.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy consists of words organized into dogmatic propositions called Theses. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 7.</I>&nbsp;Theses are linked to each other in the form of a <I>system.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 8.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy 'falls flat on its face' in a particular, different, way: for others. In its own view, philosophy is not mistaken. There is no philosophical error. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Here again I am proceeding didactically and dogmatically. The explanations will come later. But you suspect that, when I grant all your 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 78</B></FONT><P>

points, I am holding something back. You naturally suspect that in advancing Theses on philosophy <I>in general</I>, and in stating them as <I>Theses</I>, I am saying what is, but at the same time keeping my distance: I am already adopting a philosophical position with regard to philosophy in general. What position? That too will become clear later.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
<B>
2.&nbsp;The Positive Pole
</B>

<P>
In truth, you have not come here solely for the pleasure of seeing us perform our comically clumsy acrobatics. For my own part, I agree with you that we have come to 'fall flat on our faces', but in an unexpected manner that distinguishes us from the majority of philosophers and knowing it perfectly well: <I>so as to disappear into our intervention.</I> You see that we are already beginning to distance ourselves from Thesis 8. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And what about you? What attracts you and keeps you here? I would say: a sort of expectation, questions that have not been formulated and to which you have no answers, some well founded, others perhaps false. But each one expecting or demanding an answer: either a positive answer or an answer that exposes the pointlessness of the question. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In a very general sense, this expectation (coming as much from scientists as from specialists in the arts) can be stated in the following form. Leaving details to one side (we will come back to them), all these unanswered questions give rise to the following question: <I>is there not</I>, <I>after all</I>, <I>in spite of everything</I>, <I>something to be hoped for from philosophy?</I> When all is said and done, might there not be in philosophy something of relevance to our concerns? To the problems of our scientific or literary practice? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This kind of question is undoubtedly 'in the air', because you are here. Not simply out of curiosity but because it might be in your interests to be here. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  With your permission, we are going to proceed in order: going from the most superficial to the most profound - and to this end, to distinguish three levels in the reasons for this interest.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
A.&nbsp;<I>First Level</I>

<P>
First of all, there is what can only be called the fashion for interdisciplinarity. These days, an encounter between representatives of different disciplines is supposed to hold all the promise of a miracle cure. Scientists are already holding such meetings, and the CNRS<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> itself

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
2.&nbsp;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. [Ed.]
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 79</B></FONT><P>

recommends them. It is virtually the main slogan of modern times. Cities have already been built, conceived for the sole purpose of housing large communities of scientists (Princeton, Atomgorod). Interdisciplinarity is also very much the 'done thing' at all possible levels in the human sciences. So why not here? Why not an encounter between philosophers, scientists and literary specialists? Let us go further: would not the presence of philosophers give meaning to this interdisciplinary encounter? Given that he is eccentric to all scientific disciplines, might not the philosopher, by his very <I>nature</I>, be the artisan of interdisciplinarity because he is, whether he likes it or not, a 'specialist' in interdisciplinarity? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Behind the term interdisciplinarity, there may certainly be undeniably definite and important objective achievements. We will speak of them. But behind the generality of the slogan of interdisciplinarity, there is also an <I>ideological</I> myth. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   For the sake of clarity, I will take note of this by stating three Thesis: 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 9.</I>&nbsp;An ideological proposition is a proposition that, while it is the symptom of a reality other than that of which it speaks, is a false proposition to the extent that it concerns the object of which it speaks. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 10.</I>&nbsp;In the majority of cases, the slogan of interdisciplinarity is a slogan that today expresses an <I>ideological</I> proposition. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 11.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy is neither an interdisciplinary discipline nor the theory of interdisciplinarity. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I will indicate in passing: it is clear that with these Theses we are moving ever further from the domain of a definition of philosophy in general. We are taking part in debates internal to philosophy concerning a <I>stake</I> [<I>enjeu </I>] (interdisciplinarity) in order to mark our own philosophical <I>position.</I> Is it possible to define philosophy without adopting a position within philosophy? Remember this simple question.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
B.&nbsp;<I>Second Level</I>

<P>
Here we encounter the problems posed by the massive development of the sciences and technologies, and this is a much more serious matter. Problems internal to each science, and problems posed by the relations between different sciences (relations of the application of one science to another). Problems posed by the birth of new sciences in zones that might retrospectively be said to be border zones (e.g. chemistry, physics, biochemistry, etc.). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  There have always been problems internal to scientific practice. What is new is that today they seem to be posed in <I>global</I> terms: recasting earlier sciences, redrawing former borderlines. They are also posed in global terms from the social point of view: the theoretical problems of 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 80</B></FONT><P>

strategy and tactics in research; the problems of the material and financial conditions and implications of this strategy and tactics. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And so one wonders: can there be strategy and tactics in research? Can there be a direction of research? Can research be directed, or must it be free? In accordance with what ought it to be directed? Purely scientific objectives? Or <I>social</I> (that is, <I>political </I>) objectives (the prioritization of sectors), with all the financial, social and administrative consequences that implies: not only funding but also relations with industry, with politics, etc.? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And if these questions are successively resolved on a general level, what will their possible and necessary effects be at the level of research itself? It is possible to think a strategy and tactics internal to each research programme? Are there methods, methods of scientific discovery, that permit research to be 'guided'? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These are all problems before which scientists are hesitant or divided. One has only, for example, to read the official and technocratic discourses from the <I>Colloque de Caen</I> and the criticisms voiced by the young scientists of <I>Porisme.</I> Two extreme positions: absolute freedom on the one hand, planned research on the other. Between the two, the technocratic solution of Caen, inspired by American and Soviet 'models'. On the horizon, the Chinese solution. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  When faced with the complexity and difficulty of these massive problems, where it is no longer simply a question of immediate scientific practice (the researcher in his laboratory) but of the social process of the production of knowledges, of its organization and its politics (the question of who will govern it), one wonders: might not the philosopher by chance have something to say; a semblance of an answer to these questions? Something to say, for example, on the important theoretical and political alternative of freedom or planning in research? On the social and political conditions and goals of the organization of research? Or even on the method of scientific discovery? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Why not? Because such an expectation responds precisely to something that pertains to the pretension of philosophy. Those who laughingly say that philosophers 'dabble' in everything may find that the joke is on them. To put it in more elevated terms, these dabblers in everything may have certain ideas about <I>the Whole</I>, about the way things are linked to each other, about the 'totality'. This is an old tradition that goes back to Plato, for whom the philosopher is the man who <I>sees</I> the connection and articulation of the Whole. The philosopher's object is the Whole (Kant, Hegel . . .), he is the specialist of the 'totality'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Similar expectations are found amongst literary specialists who are trying to give birth to sciences. Might not the philosopher have some idea about the way the sciences, the arts, literature, economics and

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 81</B></FONT><P>

politics are related to each other, interconnected and articulated into a Whole? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   There is a certain truth behind this expectation and in this tradition. The philosopher is certainly concerned with <I>questions</I> that are not unrelated to the <I>problems</I> of scientific practice, to the problems of the process of the production of knowledges, to political and ideological problems, to the problem of relations between all these problems. Whether he has the <I>right</I> to be so concerned is another question: he <I>is.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But philosophical <I>questions</I> are not scientific <I>problems.</I> Traditional philosophy can provide answers to its own <I>questions</I>, it does not provide answers to scientific, or other, <I>problems</I> - in the sense in which scientists solve their problems. Which means: philosophy does not resolve scientific problems in the place of science; philosophical questions are not scientific problems. Here again, we are adopting a position within philosophy: philosophy is not a science, nor <I>a fortiori</I> Science; it is neither the science of the crises of science, nor the science of the Whole. Philosophical questions are not <I>ipso facto</I> scientific problems. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I will immediately record this position in the form of Theses. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 12.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy states Theses that effectively concern most of the sensitive points regarding the problems of 'the totality'. But because philosophy is neither a science nor the science of the Whole, it does not provide the solution to these problems. It intervenes in another way: by stating Theses that contribute to <I>opening the way</I> to a <I>correct</I> position with regard to these problems. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 13.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy states Theses that assemble and produce, not scientific concepts, but philosophical categories. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 14.</I>&nbsp;The set of Theses and philosophical categories that they produce can be grouped under, and function as, a <I>philosophical method.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 15.</I>&nbsp;In its modality and its functioning, philosophical method is different to a scientific method.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
C.&nbsp;<I>Third Level</I>

<P>
Here, finally, are the last reasons for your interest in philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Behind purely scientific problems we have all felt the presence of historical events of immense import. Official vocabulary sanctions this fact: 'mutations' in the sciences, 'moving into the space age', 'the revolution in civilization' (from Teilhard de Chardin to Fourasti&eacute;). All the political problems that are known to be more or less linked to these questions, the backdrop, the USA, the USSR, China. Real political and social revolutions. The feeling that we have reached a 'turning point' in the history of humanity gives renewed force to the old question: where do we come from? Where are we? And behind those questions, the 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 82</B></FONT><P>

question of questions: <I>where are we going?</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   A question to be understood in every sense of the term, and in all its aspects. It interrogates not only the world and science - where is history going? Where is science going (exploitation, well-being, nuclear war)? - but also each one of us: what is our place in the world? What place can we occupy in the world today, given its uncertain future? What attitude should we adopt with regard to our work, to the general ideas that guide or hinder our research and may guide our political action? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Behind the question: where are we going?, there is an urgent, crucial practical question: how do we <I>orientate</I> ourselves? Which direction should we follow? What is to be done? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   For intellectuals, scientists or literary specialists, the question takes a precise form: what place does our activity occupy in the world, what role does it play? What are we as intellectuals in this world? For what is an intellectual if not the product of a history and a society in which the division of labour imposes upon us this role and its blinkers? Have not the revolutions that we have known or seen announced the birth of a <I>different</I> type of intellectual? If so, what is our role in this transformation? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The meaning of history, our place in the world, the legitimacy of our profession: so many questions which, whenever the world shatters old certitudes, touch upon and always end up reviving the old religious question of <I>destiny.</I> Where are we going? And that soon becomes a different question. It becomes: what is man's destiny? Or: what are the ultimate ends of history? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We are then close to saying: philosophy must have something of an answer in mind. From the Whole to the Destiny, origins and ultimate ends, the way is short. The philosophy that claimed to be able to conceive of the Whole also claimed to be able to pronounce upon man's destiny and the Ends of history. What should we do? What may we hope for? To these moral and religious questions traditional philosophy has responded in one form or another by a theory of 'ultimate ends' which mirrors a theory of the radical 'origin' of things. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We will not play on this expectation. Once again I will respond with Theses, by taking sides, as always, in philosophy. Everyone will understand that the philosophy in question in these Theses is not philosophy in general nor <I>a fortiori</I> the philosophy of 'ultimate ends'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 16.</I>&nbsp;Philosophy does not answer questions about 'origins' and 'ultimate ends', for philosophy is neither a religion nor a moral doctrine. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 17.</I>&nbsp;The question of 'origins' and of 'ultimate ends' is an <I>ideological</I> proposition (cf. Thesis 9). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 18.</I>&nbsp;Questions of 'origins' and 'ultimate ends' are ideological propositions drawn from religious and moral ideologies, which are <I>practical ideologies.</I>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 83</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 19.&nbsp;Practical ideologies</I> are complex formations which shape notions-representations-images into behaviour-conduct-attitude-gestures. The ensemble functions as practical norms that govern the attitude and the concrete positions men adopt towards the real objects and real problems of their social and individual existence, and towards their history. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 20.</I>&nbsp;The primary function of philosophy is to draw a line of demarcation between the ideological of the ideologies on the one hand, and the scientific of the sciences on the other. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   See what has happened. The question of the meaning of history, of the destiny of man, has projected a new character to the front of the stage: the <I>ideological.</I> Not in the form that we have already encountered in <I>Thesis 9</I> (an ideological proposition is . . .) - which was purely formal - but in another form: that which relates an ideological proposition to its 'birth place': <I>practical</I> ideology, thus to a <I>social</I> reality foreign and external to scientific practice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And see what happens. With ideology (as related to practical ideologies), a third character enters the stage. Up to now we have had two of them: philosophy and science, and our central question was: what distinguishes philosophy from the sciences? What gives philosophy its own nature, distinct from the nature of the sciences? Now a new question arises: what distinguishes the scientific from the ideological? A question that must be either confronted or replaced by another but which, from the outset, has its effects upon philosophy. For the philosophy within which we have taken a position is truly haunted by practical ideologies! - since it reflects them in its theory of 'ultimate ends', be they religious or moral. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Let us simply note this point: from now on, philosophy is defined by a double relation - to the sciences and to practical ideologies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This is not speculation. If we hope to receive anything from philosophy, we must know what it can impart, and in order to know that, we must know how it is done, upon what it depends and how it functions. We advance, step by step: we discover what philosophy is <I>by practising it.</I> There is no other way. And our position is coherent: we have said that philosophy is above all <I>practical.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   You see the result. Simply taking seriously and examining not only, shall we say, the negative, or in any case mischievous, reasons, but also the positive reasons, however imprecise, that you might have had to come and hear a philosopher in the discharge of his public duties, has provoked this result: an avalanche of Theses! Do not be frightened: we will enter into the details.

<P>
The best way to avoid the aridity of Theses is, of course, to show how they function with an example. This is not an illustration: philosophy cannot be illustrated or applied. It is <I>exercised.</I> It can be learned only by being practised, for it exists only in its practice. This point could be stated in the form of a Thesis, but I leave that to you. It will be a good 'practical' exercise. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In order to show how philosophy functions, how it traces critical lines of demarcation in order to clear a correct way, we will therefore take an example: that of an <I>ideological</I> proposition, that of the slogan of <I>interdisciplinarity.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  You will see that it is not by chance that the example we have chosen is that of an <I>ideological</I> proposition. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I remind you: interdisciplinarity is today a widely diffused slogan which is expected to provide the solution to all sorts of difficult problems in the exact sciences (mathematics and the natural sciences), the human sciences, and other practices. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I remind you: an ideological proposition is a proposition which, whilst it is the symptom of a reality other than that of which it speaks, is a proposition to the extent that it concerns the object of which it speaks (Thesis 9). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What will the work of philosophy on this ideological proposition consist in? Drawing a line of demarcation between the ideological pretensions of interdisciplinarity and the realities of which it is the symptom. When we have surveyed these realities, then we will see what remains of these ideological pretensions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is clear that something like interdisciplinarity corresponds to an objective and well-founded necessity when there exists a 'command' that requires the co-ordinated co-operation of specialists from several branches of the division of labour. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  When the decision is taken to build a housing estate somewhere or other, a whole series of specialists is gathered together according to the precise needs that dictate their intervention: economists, sociologists, geologists, geographers, architects and various kinds of engineers. Whatever the results (sometimes such schemes come to nothing), in theory no one contests the need to go through that process. The interdisciplinarity defined by the technical requirements of a <I>command</I> thus appears to be the obverse of the division of labour - that is, its recomposition in a collective undertaking. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  May not the same be said of intellectual interdisciplinarity in the sciences when the 'commands' are justified? Formally, yes. Thus, physicists appeal to mathematicians, or biologists call upon the services

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 85</B></FONT><P>

of mathematicians and chemists: but they always do so to resolve <I>specific problems</I> whose solution requires the intervention of specialists from other disciplines. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If what I say is correct (at least as a first approximation, for these are simple notations), I am in the process of making a 'distinction', therefore of 'drawing a line of demarcation' between a justified recourse to technical and scientific co-operation (which may be defined by the precise demands addressed to specialists from other disciplines for the solution of problems that have emerged in a given discipline) and a different, unwarranted use of the slogan of interdisciplinarity. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  However, if the generalized, undefined slogan of interdisciplinarity expresses a proposition of an ideological nature (Thesis 9), we must consider it as such: false in what it claims to designate, but at the same time a symptom of a reality other than that which it explicitly designates. What, then, is this other reality? Let us see. It is the reality of the effective relations that have either existed for a long time between certain disciplines, whether scientific or literary, or which are in the process of being constituted between older and newer disciplines (e.g. between mathematics, etc., and the human sciences). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us examine the case a little more closely. We will differentiate between these cases:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#L1.1">1</A>.&nbsp;relations between disciplines belonging to the exact sciences;

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp;

1.&nbsp;Relations between the Exact Sciences
</B>

<P>
Very schematically, and bearing in mind possible objections, I propose to say that there exist two fundamental types of relations: relations of <I>application</I> and relations of <I>constitution.</I>

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
A.&nbsp;<I>Relations of Application</I>

<P>
I will distinguish between two such relations: the application of mathematics to the exact sciences and the application of one science to another. As you can see, I am making a <I>distinction.</I> I am drawing a line of demarcation between these two types of application. This distinction is made by philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Relations between mathematics and the natural sciences: let us immediately note the double aspect of this relation. On the one hand, all the natural sciences are mathematicized: they cannot do without 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 86</B></FONT><P>

mathematics. This relation of mathematics to the natural sciences might at first sight be considered a relation of application. But a philosophical question immediately arises: how is this application to be conceived? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We all have in our heads the common and convenient notion (in reality, an ideological notion) of application as the effect of an impression: one 'applies' a signature under a text, a design on fabric, a stamp on an envelope. An appliqu&eacute; is a thing that can be posed <I>on</I> or <I>against</I> something else. The original image of this notion is that of superimposition-impression. It implies the duality of objects: what is applied is different from that to which it is applied; and the <I>exteriority</I>, the <I>instrumentality</I> of the first is relative to the second. The common notion of application thus takes us back to the world of <I>technology.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Thus, I draw a line of demarcation. It is clear that mathematics is not applied to mathematical physics, nor to experimental physics, nor to chemistry, biology, etc., according to the mode of exteriority and instrumentality: according to the mode of <I>technology.</I> Mathematics is not, for physics, a simple 'tool' to be used when necessary, or even an 'instrument' (at least given the usual sense of the word: for example, when one speaks of a 'scientific instrument' - and even that remains to be seen). For mathematics is the very existence of theoretical physics, and it is infinitely more than a mere instrument in experimental physics. You can see the practical <I>point</I> of drawing this line of demarcation: in the space that it opens up it makes visible something that <I>could not be seen.</I> What? <I>Questions </I>: what are we to understand by the category of the <I>application</I> of mathematics to the natural sciences? First question. We will attempt to discuss it, if only to see what philosophy has been able to perceive and what it has missed (and why. Why has it necessarily missed something?). But this first question implies another, its counterpart, since by drawing a line we see that 'application' conceals 'technology': what is technology? What is its field of validity? For this word obviously covers several realities: no doubt there are also differences between the technology of the blacksmith, that of the engineer, and the technical problems that currently dominate a whole series of branches of natural science (physics, chemistry, biology), and therefore lines of demarcation to be drawn. We shall try. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But the relationship between mathematics and the natural sciences works both ways. The natural sciences pose problems for mathematics: they have always done so. The application of mathematics to the sciences therefore conceals another, inverse, relation: that by which mathematics is obliged, in order to meet the demands of the sciences, to formulate problems that may be either those of 'applied' mathematics or those of pure mathematics. It is as though mathematics gave back, in a more elaborated form, to the sciences what it received from them. Can

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 87</B></FONT><P>

we still speak of 'application' in this organic exchange? Should we not rather speak another language, and say that there exists between mathematics and the natural sciences another relation, a relation of <I>constitution</I> - mathematics being neither a tool nor an instrument, nor a method, nor a language at the service of the sciences, but an <I>active participant</I> in the existence of the sciences, in their constitution? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  One word in place of another: <I>constitution</I> in place of <I>application </I>:  it does not seem like much. Yet this is how philosophy proceeds. One word is enough to open up the space for a question, for a question that has not been posed. The new word throws the old words into disorder and creates a space for the new question. The new question calls into question the old answers, and the old questions lurking behind them. A new view of things is thus attained. It may be the same with the word 'constitution', if it is 'correct'.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
B.&nbsp;<I>Relations of Constitution</I>

<P>
Let us take the case in all its generality: the intervention of one science, or a part of a science, in the practice of another science. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These relations are typical of contemporary scientific phenomena. Increasingly, so-called 'neighbouring' disciplines are brought into play in 'zones' which were once considered to be definitive 'frontiers'. From these new relations new disciplines are born: physical chemistry, biophysics, biochemistry, etc. These new disciplines are often the indirect result of the development of new branches within the classical disciplines: thus atomic physics had its effects on chemistry and biology; in conjunction with the progress of organic chemistry, it contributed to the birth of biochemistry. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These exchanges are organic relations constituted between the different scientific disciplines without external philosophical intervention. They obey purely scientific necessities, purely internal to the sciences under consideration. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  One thing is sure: <I>these relations do not constitute what contemporary ideology calls interdisciplinary exchanges.</I> The new disciplines (physical chemistry, biochemistry) were not the product of interdisciplinary 'round tables'. Nor are they 'interdisciplinary sciences'. They are either new branches of classical sciences or new sciences. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We are therefore obliged to draw a <I>line of demarcation</I> between interdisciplinary ideology and the effective reality of the process of the mutual application and constitution of sciences. The act of drawing such a line of demarcation has both theoretical and practical implications. <I>Theoretically</I>, this line of demarcation clearly reveals <I>philosophical questions </I>:  what is the application of mathematics to the sciences? What 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 88</B></FONT><P>

is technology? What is the application of one science to another? Why is it necessary (at first) to speak of constitution rather than of application? What concrete dialectic is at work in these complex relations? These philosophical questions can open the way to <I>scientific problems</I> (of the history of the sciences, or rather the conditions of the processes of constitution of the sciences). <I>Practically</I>, this line of demarcation can have <I>real effects </I>:  avoiding conceptions, tendencies or temptations which might lead to unthinking 'interdisciplinary' collaboration, and encouraging every productive practice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I will draw one final conclusion. There are false ideas about science, not simply in the heads of philosophers but in the heads of scientists themselves: false 'obviousnesses' that, far from being means of making progress, are in reality 'epistemological obstacles' (Bachelard).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp88">3</A>]</FONT> They must be criticized and dispelled by showing that the imaginary solutions they offer in fact conceal real problems (Thesis 9). But it is necessary to go still further: to recognize that it is not by chance that these false ideas reign in certain regions within the domain of scientific activity. They are non-scientific, ideological ideas and representations. They form what we will provisionally call scientific ideology, or the ideology of scientists. A philosophy <I>capable</I> of discerning and criticizing them can have the effect of drawing the attention of scientists to the existence and efficacy of the epistemological obstacle that this spontaneous scientific ideology represents: the representation that scientists have of their own practice, and of their relationship to their own practice. Here again philosophy does not substitute itself for science: it intervenes, in order to clear a path, to open the space in which a correct line may then be drawn. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  From this I draw <I>Thesis 21.</I>&nbsp;Scientific ideology (or the ideology of scientists) is inseparable from scientific practice: it is the 'spontaneous' ideology of scientific practice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Here again I anticipate. I will explain. I have only one more word to say about this 'spontaneous' ideology: we will see that it is 'spontaneous' <I>because it is not.</I> One of philosophy's little surprises.

2.&nbsp;Relations between Scientific and Literary Disciplines

<P>
These relations are proliferating in a spectacular manner. To make them visible we will again 'bring into play' the difference between our two categories: application and constitution.

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 89</B></FONT><P>

between mathematics and the human sciences to the relationship just discussed between mathematics and the natural sciences. But there is a great difference: in the case of the human sciences the relationship with mathematics is manifestly, in whole or in part, an external, non-organic relationship; in short, a <I>technical</I> relation of application. In the natural sciences, the question of the <I>conditions</I> of application of mathematics and hence of the legitimacy of this application, and of its technical forms, is not a problematic question; philosophy can pose questions, but it does not create problems for scientific practice. In contrast, in the human sciences this question is most often <I>problematic.</I> Some (spiritualist) philosophers contest the very possibility of a mathematicization of the human sciences; others contest the technical forms of this application. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is this problematic character, this hesitation, that is expressed in the <I>wish</I> for interdisciplinarity and in the expression 'interdisciplinary exchange'. The notion of interdisciplinarity indicates not a solution but a <I>contradiction </I>:  the fact of the relative exteriority of the disciplines placed in relation. This exteriority (mathematics as a tool, a 'tool' that is to a greater or lesser extent adaptable) expresses the problematic character of these relations or of their technical forms (<I>what</I> use is being made of mathematics in 'psychology', in political economy, in sociology, in history . . .? What complicities are in fact being established behind the prestige of the use of mathematics?). As we go on asking questions, we finally arrive at the conclusion that this exteriority expresses and betrays the <I>uncertainty</I> which the majority of the human sciences feel concerning their theoretical status. This <I>generalized impatience</I> to embrace mathematics is a symptom: they have not attained theoretical maturity. Is this simply an 'infantile disorder', to be explained by the relative youth of the human sciences? Or is it more serious: is it an indication that the human sciences, for the most part, 'miss' their object, that they are not based on their true distinctive foundation, that there is a sort of mis-recognition between the human sciences and their pretensions, that they miss the object that they claim to grasp because, paradoxically, this object (or at least the <I>object</I> they take as their <I>own </I>) <I>does not exist?</I> All these questions are supported by the real experiences from which Kant, in another time, had drawn the lesson (for theology, but also for rational psychology and rational cosmology): <I>there may exist sciences whose objects do not exist</I>, <I>there may exist sciences without an object</I> (in the strict sense).<FONT SIZE=-2>[4]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  New distinctions should be made here, but, as always, I must anticipate. I will therefore take the risk of pronouncing upon the phenomenon as a whole, and take a position. I say: in <I>the majority</I> of the human sciences mathematizing inflation is not a childhood illness but a desperate attempt to fill a fundamental gap: <I>with some distinct exceptions</I> the human sciences are sciences without an object (in the strict sense). They have a false or equivocal theoretical base, they produce long discourses and numerous 'findings', but because they are too confident that they know <I>of what</I> they are the sciences, in fact they do not 'know' <I>what</I> they are the sciences <I>of </I>:  a misunderstanding. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But let us leave relations of application, and move on to relations of constitution. These may be seen today in a discipline traditionally considered a branch of philosophy: logic. Today logic has become mathematical logic, making it, in fact, independent of philosophy. It has a status of its own. In a certain sense it might be compared to the new borderline disciplines that are to be seen in the natural sciences, such as physical chemistry or biophysics. Mathematical logic is a branch of mathematics, but as a scientific discipline it functions above all in the human sciences. It is, or can be, the object of applications in a whole series of literary disciplines (linguistics, semiology, psychoanalysis, literary history). Here too there is a whole series of questions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  From these summary and general remarks, some conclusions may be drawn. It may be said:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  - That between the human sciences and the natural sciences, and above all between the human sciences and mathematics, on the one hand, and mathematical logic, on the other, there exist relations <I>formally</I> similar to the relations that exist between the exact sciences, with the double phenomena that we have observed: application and constitution;

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  - But that this relation is far more external, and therefore technical (non-organic), than the relations that exist between the exact sciences themselves. That this exteriority seems to authorize an expression such as the notion of 'interdisciplinary' exchanges and therefore the notion of interdisciplinarity, but that this notion is in all probability an illusory name for a problem entirely different to the problem it designates;

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  - That, at the same time, the use of <I>certain philosophies</I> by the human sciences seems necessary to the establishment of this relation. Here again we see a new and important index. Whereas in the exact sciences everything proceeds without any <I>visible</I> intervention on the part of philosophy and its apparatus, in the human sciences the structure of

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 91</B></FONT><P>

relations between the sciences and the human sciences seems to require, for ill-explained and therefore confused reasons, the intrusive intervention of this third character that is philosophy: in person.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us note an important point here. (1) The human sciences use philosophical categories and subordinate them to their objectives. They get through a lot of philosophy, but the initiative <I>seems</I> not to come from philosophy. <I>Appearances</I> suggest that this is not a matter of a critical intervention on the part of philosophy in the ideological problems of the human sciences, but, on the contrary, an <I>exploitation</I> by the human sciences of certain philosophical categories or philosophies. (2) It is not a question of 'philosophy' in general, but of very determinate categories or philosophies, idealist (positivist, neo-positivist, structuralist, formalist, phenomenological, etc.) or spiritualist. (3) The philosophies or philosophical categories thus 'exploited' by the human sciences are used practically by them as an <I>ideological substitute</I> for the theoretical base they lack. (4) But then the following question may be posed: is not the philosophical practice <I>borrowed</I> by the human sciences at the same time an appearance? Should we not reverse the order of things? And in the necessary complicity between the human sciences and these idealist philosophies, <I>are not the philosophies in command </I>? Are not the human sciences sciences without an object because they do no more than 'realize' in their 'object' determinate idealist philosophical tendencies rooted in the 'practical ideologies' of our time, that is, of our society? Are sciences without objects simply philosophies disguised as sciences? After all, that would seem to be a fairly convincing argument since, as we know, philosophy has no object. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In any event, the Thesis that philosophies serve as an ideological substitute for the theoretical foundations that the human sciences lack holds for the majority of the human sciences: not for all, for there are exceptions (e.g. psychoanalysis and, to a certain extent, linguistics, etc.). I remind you also that this thesis does not imply that certain aspects, procedures and even certain findings of the human sciences cannot possess a positive value. Each case has to be examined in detail: but that is no more than an internal and minor aspect of an <I>overall</I> investigation. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It follows from this that the proportion of 'dubious' ideas increases as we move from relations between the exact sciences to relations between the exact sciences and the human sciences. We dealt earlier with localized and localizable false ideas. Now we have no real grounds for speaking of false ideas, but we can speak of generalized suspect ideas. The exploitation of certain philosophies is in direct proportion to the suspect character of these ideas. What we might call scientific ideologies 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 92</B></FONT><P>

and philosophical ideologies assume an extreme importance in the domain of the human sciences. Not only do these ideologies exist and have great importance in our world, but they directly govern the scientific practices of the human sciences. They take the place of theory in the human sciences. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Hence the importance of a philosophy capable of drawing a line of demarcation which will traverse the domain of the majority of human sciences: to help distinguish 'true' sciences from would-be sciences and to distinguish their <I>de facto</I> ideological foundations from the <I>de jure</I> theoretical foundations (provisionally defined in negative terms) which might make them something other than sciences without an object. Hence the importance of our position, which now becomes clear: this task cannot be undertaken and successfully completed in the name of the philosophies that the human sciences think they are exploiting, whereas they are in fact their garrulous slaves. It can be undertaken only in the name of another, completely <I>different</I>, philosophy. <I>The line of demarcation thus runs through philosophy itself.</I>

3.&nbsp;Relations between Literary Disciplines
</B>

<P>
These relations have always been numerous and close. They are apparently in the midst of fundamental change. If this is true, it is because the disciplines of the human sciences are in the midst of fundamental change: at least, that is what they claim. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us take a closer look. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Traditionally, literary disciplines have rested on a very particular relation to their object: a practical relation of utilization, appreciation, of taste, or, if you prefer, consumption. <I>Belles lettres</I>, the humanities and the teaching practices and research that have been attached to them for centuries, make them a school of 'culture'. This means two things. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;The relation between literary disciplines and their object (literature properly speaking, the fine arts, history, logic, philosophy, ethics, religion) has as its <I>dominant</I> function not so much the knowledge of this object but rather the definition and inculcation of rules, norms and practices designed to establish 'cultural' relations between the 'literate' and these objects. Above all: to know how to handle these objects in order to consume them 'properly'. To know how to 'read' - that is, 'taste', 'appreciate' - a classical text, to know how 'to apply the lessons' of history, to know how to apply the right method to think 'well' (logic), to know how to look to correct ideas (philosophy) in order to know where we stand in relation to the great questions of human existence, science, ethics, religion, etc. Through their particular relations, the arts or

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 93</B></FONT><P>

humanities thus impart a certain <I>knowledge</I> [<I>savoir </I>]: not a scientific knowledge of their object, and not a scientific knowledge of the mechanism of their object, but - in addition to the particular erudition needed for familiarity - a <I>savoir-faire</I> or, to be more accurate, a <I>know-how-to-do</I> to appreciate-judge, and enjoy-consume-utilize this object which is properly 'culture': a knowledge invested in a knowing how to do in order to . . . For in this couple, what is secondary (and, although not negligible, superficial, formal) is <I>knowledge </I>; what matters is the <I>knowing how to do in order to</I> . . . Basically, the arts were therefore the pedagogical site <I>par excellence</I>, or, in other words, a site for cultural training: learning to think properly, to judge properly, to enjoy properly, and to behave properly towards all the cultural objects involved in human existence. Their goal? The well-bred gentleman, the man of culture. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;The practical relation of consumption that exists between literary disciplines and their object cannot be considered a relation of scientific knowledge [<I>connaissance </I>]. The 'culture' provided by the humanities in their different forms (literature, logic, history, ethics, philosophy, etc.) was never any more than the commentary made on certain consecrated objects by the culture that exists in society itself. To understand the meaning of the 'culture' provided by the humanities, it is necessary to question not the humanities themselves, or not only the humanities, but the 'culture' which exists in the society that 'cultivates' these arts, the class functions of that culture, and therefore the class divisions of that society. The 'culture' taught in the schools is in fact never anything more than a <I>second-degree culture</I>, a culture that 'cultivates', for the benefit of a greater or lesser number of individuals in this society, and with reference to certain privileged objects (<I>belles lettres</I>, the arts, logic, philosophy, etc.), <I>the art of relating to those objects</I> as a practical means of inculcating in those individuals defined norms of practical behaviour with respect to the institutions and 'values' of that society and to the events that occur within it. Culture is the elite and/or mass ideology of a given society. Not the <I>real ideology of the masses</I> (for, as a result of class oppositions, there are several tendencies within culture) but the ideology that the ruling class seeks to inculcate, directly or indirectly, through education or other means, and on a discriminatory basis (one culture for the elite, one for the popular masses), into the masses they dominate. We are speaking here of an enterprise of <I>hegemonic</I> character (Gramsci): obtaining the <I>consent</I> of the masses through the diffusion of ideology (through the presentation and inculcation of culture). The dominant ideology is always imposed on the masses against certain tendencies in their own culture which are neither recognized nor sanctioned, but do resist.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 94</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This idea of the arts is not in accordance with the received idea. We should not be content to take the arts at their word and accept the definition they give of themselves. Behind the literary disciplines there is a long heritage: that of the humanities. To understand the humanities, we must seek out the meaning of the 'culture' they dispense <I>in the norms</I> of the <I>forms of behaviour</I> that are <I>dominant</I> in the society under consideration: religious, moral, juridical, political, etc., ideology - in short, in <I>practical ideologies.</I> With this implication: the literary culture dispensed by the teaching that goes on in schools <I>is not a purely academic phenomenon </I>; it is one moment in the ideological 'education' of the popular masses. Through its means and effects, it intersects with other ideologies mobilized at the same time: religious, juridical, moral, political, etc. The many ideological means by which the ruling class achieves hegemony and thus holds power are all grouped around the State over which the ruling class holds power. This <I>connection</I> - one might say this <I>synchronization</I> - between literary culture (which is the object-objective of the classical humanities) and the mass ideological action exercised by the Church, the State, law, and by the forms of the political regime, etc., are, of course, usually <I>masked.</I> But it comes to light during great political and ideological crises in which, for example, educational reforms are openly recognized as revolutions in the methods of ideological action deployed against the masses. At such times, it can be clearly seen that education is directly related to the dominant ideology and it is apparent that its conception, its orientation and control are an important stake in the class struggle. Some examples: the Convention's educational reform, Jules Ferry's educational reforms, the educational reforms that so pre-occupied Lenin and Krupskaya, the educational reforms of the Cultural Revolution, etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But the sciences too are a teaching object. The arts - by which I mean the humanities, as defined by their long history - are therefore not the only 'subject matter' of 'cultural' - that is, ideological - training. The teaching of the sciences is also the site of a similar 'cultural' training, although it takes more subtle, infinitely less visible form. But <I>the way</I> the exact sciences themselves are taught implies a certain ideological relation to their existence and their content. There is no teaching of pure knowledge [<I>savoir </I>] that is not at the same time a <I>savoir-faire</I> - that is, the definition of a know-how-to-act-in-relation-to-this-knowledge, and to its <I>theoretical and social function.</I> This know-how . . . implies a political attitude towards the object of knowledge, towards knowledge as object, and towards its place in society. All science teaching, whether it wants to or not, conveys an ideology of science and of its findings - that is, a certain knowing-how-to-act-in-relation-to-science and its findings, based on a certain idea of the place of science in society, and on a

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 95</B></FONT><P>

certain idea of the role of intellectuals who specialize in scientific knowledge and therefore of the division between manual and intellectual labour. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For intellectuals, nothing could be more difficult than perceiving the ideology conveyed by education, and by its curriculum, its forms and its practices. This applies to the sciences as well as the arts. Intellectuals live in culture, just as fish live in water; but fish cannot see the water in which they swim! Everything about them militates against their having any accurate perception of the social position of the culture in which they are steeped, of the teaching which dispenses it, or of the disciplines they practise - to say nothing of the positions they occupy in this society as intellectuals, academics or research workers. Everything militates against it: the effects of the division of labour (primarily the division between manual and intellectual labour, but also divisions within intellectual labour; divisions between intellectual specialisms), the impressive immediacy of the object of their activity, which absorbs all their attention, and the character of their practice, which is at once extremely concrete and extremely abstract, etc. Their practice, which they carry out in a framework defined by laws that they do not control, thus spontaneously produces an ideology which they live without having any reason to break out of it. But matters do not end there. Their own ideology, the spontaneous ideology of their practice (their ideology of science or the arts) does not depend solely on their own practice: it depends mainly and in the last instance on the dominant ideological system of the society in which they live. Ultimately, it is this ideological system especially that governs the very forms of their ideology of science and of the arts. What seems to happen before their eyes happens, in reality, <I>behind their backs.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But let us return to the arts. For some time - since the eighteenth century, but in an infinitely more rapid and accelerated fashion in the last few years - relations between literary disciplines have apparently undergone a fundamental change. It is a primarily <I>practical</I>, that is, ideological and political relation. From all sides the literary disciplines proclaim that this relationship has changed. It would seem to have become <I>scientific.</I> Even if it is highly inconsistent, this phenomenon is visible in the majority of the disciplines known as the human sciences. We are not speaking of logic: logic has been displaced and is now a part of mathematics. But linguistics, at least in some of its 'regions', seems to have become a science. Even the credentials of psychoanalysis, for a long time condemned and banished, have begun to be recognized. Other disciplines also claim to have attained the level of scientificity: political economy, sociology, psychology, history. . . . Literary history itself has been given a new lease of life, and has put the tradition of the humanities behind it.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 96</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is on the basis of this contradictory situation that we can begin to understand the relations which are currently being tentatively established between the different literary disciplines. They lay claim to the name of 'human sciences', marking with the word <I>sciences</I> their claims to having broken off their old relationship with their object. Instead of a cultural - that is, ideological - relation, they want to install a new relation: scientific. On the whole, they think they have succeeded in this conversion and proclaim it in the name they give themselves, by baptizing themselves 'human sciences'. But a proclamation may be no more than a proclamation, an intention, or a programme. It may also be in part a myth designed to sustain an illusion, or a 'wish-fuffilment'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is not certain that the human sciences have really changed their 'nature' by changing their name and their methods. The relations that are currently being established between the literary disciplines are proof of that: the systematic mathematicization of a number of disciplines (economics, sociology, psychology); and the 'application' of disciplines manifestly more advanced in scientfficity to others (the pioneering role of mathematical logic and especially linguistics, the equally intrusive role of psycho-analysis, etc.). Contrary to what has occurred in the natural sciences, in which relations are generally organic, this kind of 'application' remains external, instrumental, technical and therefore suspect. The most aberrant contemporary example of the external application of a 'method' (which in its 'universality' is following fashion) to any object whatsoever is 'structuralism'. When disciplines are in search of a universal 'method', we may wager that they are a little too anxious to demonstrate their scientific credentials really to have earned them. True sciences never need to let the world know that they have found the key to becoming sciences. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Another sensitive point in this equivocal process appears in the relation that exists between this relation (between disciplines) and philosophy. The human sciences that are being constituted openly <I>exploit</I> certain philosophies. They seek in these philosophies (for example in phenomenology, whose influence is on the wane; in structuralism; not to mention in Hegelianism and even Nietzscheanism) a base of support and a way of orientating themselves. That is what they are looking for in philosophy, even when they aggressively reject all philosophy; though, given their current state, theirs is a <I>philosophical</I> rejection of philosophy (a variety of positivism). As we have seen, this relation may be reversed: it is only because they themselves realize the dominant ideology that the human sciences can exploit philosophy or the other disciplines that stand in for philosophy (thus linguistics and psychoanalysis function increasingly as 'philosophies' for literary history, 'semiology', etc.). In all this to-ing and fro-ing something appears, if we are willing to see it, as an

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 97</B></FONT><P>

absence, a lack - the very thing which the sciences need if they are to deserve the name of science: a recognition of their theoretical base. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These relationships, whether direct or indirect, bring us back to our term and our question: <I>interdisciplinarity.</I> This myth enjoys a wide currency in the human sciences and in general. Sociology, economics, psychology, linguistics and literary history constantly borrow notions, methods and procedures from existing disciplines, whether literary or scientific. We are speaking of the eclectic practice of holding interdisciplinary 'round tables'. All the neighbours are invited, no one is forgotten - one never knows. Inviting everyone so as to leave no one out means that we do not know precisely who to invite, <I>where</I> we are or where we are going. The practice of 'round tables' is necessarily accompanied by an ideology of the virtues of interdisciplinarity, of which it is the counterpoint and the mass. This ideology is contained in a formula: when one does not know what the world does not know, it suffices to assemble all the ignorant: science will emerge from an assembly of the ignorant. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Am I joking? This practice is in flagrant contradiction with what we know of the process of constitution of real sciences, including new sciences. They are never born out of specialists' 'round tables'. In fact, this practice and its ideology are in accordance with what we know of the <I>processes of domination of ideologies.</I> When everyone is invited, it is not the hoped-for new science that is being invited (for it is never the result of a gathering of specialists who are ignorant of it), but a character no one has invited - and whom it is not necessary to invite, since it invites itself! - the <I>common theoretical ideology</I> that silently inhabits the 'consciousness' of all these specialists: when they gather together, it speaks out loud - through their voice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Apart from certain specific cases, most often technical, where this practice has its place (when a discipline makes a justified request of another on the basis of real organic links between disciplines), interdisciplinarity therefore remains a magical practice, in the service of an ideology, in which scientists (or would-be scientists) formulate an imaginary idea of the division of scientific labour, of the relations between sciences and the conditions of 'discovery', to give the impression of grasping an object that escapes them. Very concretely, interdisciplinarity is usually the slogan and the practice of the spontaneous ideology of specialists: oscillating between a vague spiritualism and technocratic positivism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Concerning all this, there are false ideas to be avoided in order to open the way to the correct ideas. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Once again, it is necessary to ask what the application of one science to another, of determinate methods to a new object in the literary 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 98</B></FONT><P>

disciplines, might consist of. Once again, it is even more necessary to examine the nature of the pre-existing ideology and to penetrate its current disguises. Finally, it is necessary to pose the question of questions: are the human sciences, with certain limited exceptions, what they think they are - that is, sciences? Or are they in their majority something else, namely <I>ideological techniques of social adaptation and readaptation </I>? If this is in fact what they are, they have not, as they claim, broken with their former ideological and political 'cultural' function: they act through other, more 'sophisticated', perfected techniques, but still in the service of the same cause. It will suffice to note the direct relation they maintain with a whole series of other techniques, such as <I>human relations</I> and modern forms of mass media, to be convinced that this hypothesis is not an imaginary one. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But then, it is not simply the status of the human sciences that is in question but the status of the theoretical basis that they claim to have provided for themselves. Question: what makes up the <I>apparatus</I> that permits disciplines to function as ideological techniques? This is the question that philosophy poses.

<P>
Let us summarize the lessons that can be drawn from this simple example: <I>interdisciplinarity.</I> What in fact does the slogan of interdisciplinarity mask?

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   1.&nbsp;Certain real practices, perfectly founded and legitimate: practices that remain to be defined, in cases that remain to be defined. To define them is to distinguish them from others. The first line of demarcation.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   2.&nbsp;In the interior of these practices and these real problems, there are new distinctions to be made (application, constitution) and therefore new lines of demarcation to be drawn.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   3.&nbsp;Outside these real practices, we encounter the pretensions of certain disciplines that declare themselves to be sciences (human sciences). What are we to make of their pretensions? By means of a new line of demarcation we distinguish between the real function of most of the human sciences and the ideological character of their pretensions.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   4.&nbsp;If we go back to the slogan of interdisciplinarity, we are now in a position to state (on the basis of certain resistant symptoms) that it is massively <I>ideological</I> in character.

<P>
The 'lesson' to be drawn from this brief summary? We have made our definition of philosophy 'function': philosophy states Theses which draw

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 99</B></FONT><P>

lines of demarcation. We have been able to show that this practice, however 'wild' [<I>sauvage </I>] (as in this lecture), produces results. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Everyone can agree on one thing: we have not once, for a single moment, given in to the temptation of most philosophies and philosophers. We have not <I>exploited</I> the findings or difficulties of the sciences for the greater glory of <I>a</I> Truth or <I>the</I> Truth. In this way we have demarcated ourselves from the dominant philosophical currents and we have marked out our own position. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   If we have respected the sciences and their findings, and if philosophy is an intervention, <I>where</I> have we intervened? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Note well: each time we have intervened, it has been to draw a line of demarcation. Further, each time we have drawn a line of demarcation, it has been to <I>make something appear</I> that was not visible before our intervention. What? The existence, reality, consistency and function of what we have called theoretical or scientific <I>ideology</I> - or, better still, the spontaneous <I>ideology</I> of the practice of scientists or supposed scientists. And behind these forms of ideology, other forms - practical ideologies and the dominant ideology. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But just as it makes the ideological appear, the line of demarcation makes it possible to recognize, on the other side of the divide, the <I>scientific</I> that is obscured by the ideological: by <I>extricating</I> it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The ideological is something that relates to practice and to society. The scientific is something that relates to knowledge [<I>connaissance </I>] and to the sciences. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So, where have we intervened? Very precisely, in the 'space' where the ideological and the scientific merge but where they can and must be separated, to recognize each in its functioning and to free scientific practice from the ideological domination that blocks it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Provisionally, we can say that the essential function of the philosophy practised on these positions is to draw lines of demarcation, all of which seem capable of introducing, in the last instance, a line of demarcation between <I>the scientific and the ideological.</I> From this follows 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 22.</I>&nbsp;All the lines of demarcation traced by philosophy are ultimately modalities of a fundamental line: the line between the scientific and the ideological. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We have thus shown that the result of these philosophical interventions is the production of new <I>philosophical questions </I>:  what is the application of one science to another? The constitution of one science by another? Technology? Ideology? The relation between the ideological and the philosophical? Etc. <I>These philosophical questions are not scientific problems.</I> Philosophy does not encroach upon the domain of the sciences. But <I>these philosophical questions can help to pose scientific problems</I>, in the space that they open.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 100</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Such is the 'game' of philosophy, as we practise it - drawing lines of demarcation that produce new philosophical questions without end. Philosophy does not respond like a science to the questions it produces, with demonstrated solutions or proven findings (in the scientific sense of these words): it responds by stating Theses which are correct, not arbitrary, and which in turn draw new lines of demarcation, giving rise to new philosophical questions, <I>ad infinitum.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This much is  <I>obvious</I>, but behind the obvious something else happens. This operation - drawing lines of demarcation to produce philosophical questions; provoking new Theses, etc. - is not a speculative game. It is an operation that has <I>practical</I> effects. What are they? Let us summarize them in one word: the <I>line</I> (that takes the form of justified Theses, which in turn give rise to an intelligible discourse) that divides the scientific from the ideological has as its practical effect the 'opening of a way', therefore the removal of obstacles, opening a space for a 'correct line' <I>for the practices</I> that are at stake in philosophical Theses.
  But I think this is enough for the first lecture.

<P>
In this second lecture we will again take up our central question: what is philosophy? And this question will take us on a long journey. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But it will be objected: haven't I already answered this question? Yes and no. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Yes: I have put forward Theses on philosophy and I have even shown how philosophy 'functions' with a precise example: the slogan of interdisciplinarity. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  No: for it is not enough to put forward Theses on philosophy and to show how it 'functions' to settle the question. Things are not so simple. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For example, to begin at the end ('functioning'), and assuming that this kind of comparison is not too odious, it might be objected: it is not enough to <I>see</I> a machine 'function' - a combustion engine, for example - to understand its mechanism and, <I>a fortiori</I> the physical and chemical laws that regulate the functioning of this mechanism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For example, to go back to the beginning (Theses on philosophy): when I laid my cards on the table, you had the definite feeling that I was making a strange finesse. When, with my first words, I said: 'Philosophical propositions are <I>Theses </I>', and quickly added: '<I>This</I> proposition is itself a philosophical Thesis' by which I put Thesis 1 into play, you obviously noticed that my argument was circular: because I declared that the proposition by which I defined philosophical propositions as <I>Theses</I> was itself a <I>philosophical</I> Thesis. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This might have been an unperceived contradiction, a careless error or an evasion. However, I entered the necessary circle deliberately. Why? To show even crudely that whilst it is indispensable to leave philosophy in order to understand it, we must guard against the illusion of being able to provide a definition - that is, a knowledge - of philosophy 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 102</B></FONT><P>

that would be able <I>radically</I> to escape from philosophy: there is no possibility of achieving a science of philosophy or a 'meta-philosophy'; one cannot radically escape the <I>circle</I> of philosophy. All <I>objective</I> knowledge of philosophy is in effect at the same time a <I>position within</I> philosophy, and therefore a Thesis in and on philosophy; that is why you felt, on the contrary, that <I>I could speak of philosophy in general only from a certain position in philosophy </I>:  demarcating myself, by distancing myself from <I>other</I> existing positions. There is no objective discourse about philosophy that is not itself philosophical, and therefore a discourse based upon certain positions <I>within</I> philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is to mark this inescapable condition that I have inscribed it in the <I>circle</I> of a <I>Thesis that defines philosophical positions as Theses.</I> Accordingly, this circle is not inconsistent but entirely consistent: <I>I said what I was doing.</I> It is obviously impossible to explain in a few words the sense in which this circle is necessary and productive, not at all sterile like logical 'circles' - to explain, in other words, the sense in which it is not a circle at all. But this question holds some surprises. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To go back to my first Theses. I pronounced a certain little word which, as I know from the questions I was asked, held your attention and proved intriguing, if not worrisome. In effect, I said that philosophical propositions, unlike scientific propositions that are said to be true because they are proven or demonstrated, are declared <I>correct</I> (or incorrect). And I added that the 'true' relates to knowledge, while the 'correct' relates to practice. In passing, two words: common but singular. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  They are even more singular in that philosophy has, throughout its history, always spoken of Truth and error, of the True and the false, and in that philosophers always begin with a 'Search for the Truth' and always wage their struggle in the name of the Truth: in that <I>philosophical propositions have never been qualified as correct.</I> And here I am claiming that they are <I>said</I> to be correct or not, but <I>by whom</I> are they said to be thus? - since no one in the whole of philosophy has used this adjective. The first 'finesse': they are not <I>said</I> to be correct but they certainly relate to this adjective: <I>correct.</I> If we wish to understand what happens in philosophy, we must consider that its propositions, regardless of their <I>declared</I> devotion to the presence and adequation of the Truth, are bound up with the world in which they intervene by a very different relation: that of <I>correctness.</I> They are not said to be <I>correct</I>, but we will say that they are correct, in part to understand why they are <I>said</I> by philosophers to be 'true'. <I>Correct</I> is the password that will permit us to enter into philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is understood that <I>correct</I> [<I>juste </I>] is not the adjectival form of <I>justice</I> [<I>justice </I>]. When St Thomas Aquinas distinguished between just and unjust wars, he spoke in the name of <I>justice.</I> But when Lenin distin-

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 103</B></FONT><P>

guished between correct and incorrect wars [<I>les guerres justes et les guerres injustes </I>], he spoke in the name of correctness [<I>justesse </I>]: of a correct line, of a correct assessment of the character of wars in the light of their class meaning. Of course, a politically correct war is waged by combatants who have a passion for justice in their hearts: but it is not only justice (an idealized notion under and in which men 'live' their relations to their conditions of existence and to their struggles) that made a war 'correct' for Lenin. A war is correct when it conforms to a correct position and line in the conjuncture of a given balance of forces: as a practical intervention in line with the class struggle, correct because it has been <I>aligned</I> with the meaning of the class struggle. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But even when we have left behind philosophical Truth and avoided the pitfalls of Justice, there still remains this little word: <I>correct</I> [<I>juste </I>] and its cognate: <I>correctness</I> [<I>justesse </I>]. And this question: what distinguishes the 'correct' from the 'true?' 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And that question immediately provokes fear: is there not, in the philosophy that I have presented, a higher Authority which will decide what is <I>correct </I>? And is not the philosophy of which we speak the Judge or Last Judgement that renders unto Caesar that which is Caesar's <I>by dividing </I>? And in the name of what is it going to divide? But let us take care not to fall into the abyss of metaphor: for 'Judge' pertains to 'Justice', an institution of the State that pronounces and applies a pre-existing <I>Law.</I> In the codes of its Law, the Justice of the State inscribes, in the form of a pre-established order, the rules of the established Order, the rules of its reproduction. The correctness [<I>justesse </I>] of which we speak is not pre-established: it does not pre-exist the <I>adjustment</I>, it is its result. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Adjustment: that, for the moment, is the essential word. When philosophy in its practice 'draws a line of demarcation' to delineate practically, and state theoretically, a position that is a Thesis (Thesis = Position), philosophy may well appear to be appealing to pre-established Truths or Rules, to the Judgement to which it submits and conforms: even when it does this (and God knows it has done it often enough in its history: indeed, that's all it has ever done), in reality it <I>adjusts</I> its Thesis by taking account of all the elements that make up the existing political, ideological and theoretical conjuncture, by taking account of what it calls the 'Whole'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But see how things are. This conjuncture is political, ideological and theoretical. We know that, and we can show that it is so: every great philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Kant, Hegel, etc.) has always taken into account the political conjuncture (the great events of the class struggle), the ideological conjuncture (the great conflicts between and within practical ideologies), <I>and</I> the theoretical conjuncture. But what does <I>theoretical</I> mean?

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 104</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To limit ourselves to the essential, the domain of theory embraces the whole of science and the whole of philosophy. Philosophy itself is therefore part of the conjuncture in which it intervenes: it exists within this conjuncture, it exists within the 'Whole'. It follows that philosophy cannot entertain an external, purely speculative relation, a relation of pure knowledge to the conjuncture, because it <I>takes part in this ensemble.</I> That suggests that a <I>Thesis</I> does not have an 'object' but a <I>stake</I>, that the relationship between a Thesis and what is at stake in it cannot be simply a relation of 'Truth' ( = a relation between a knowledge and its object) and therefore of pure knowledge, but that it must be a <I>practical</I> relation, a practical relation of <I>adjustment.</I> How should these terms be understood? (1) <I>Practical</I> relation does not mean only that this relation gives rise to practical effects (although it does). <I>Practical</I> relation signifies something else: the balance of power internal to a field dominated by contradiction and conflicts. (2) That gives the process of <I>adjustment</I> its very particular meaning: an adjustment <I>in struggle</I>, let us say, between the existing ideas - some dominant, others dominated. (3) It is at this point that <I>practical results</I> intervene: the new position delineated and established by the Thesis (Thesis = Position) modifies other positions and affects the realities that are the stake of the entire process of adjustment in struggle which results in the establishment of 'correct' (or incorrect) Theses. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If this is clear, it may be seen that we have escaped the worst pitfall of all. That pitfall pertains to the inevitable misunderstanding that arises as soon as the word 'practice' is pronounced. The misunderstanding results from a <I>pragmatist</I> conception of practice. For I know what is in store for us here. It will be said that the mechanic too adjusts a 'part' so that the motor will run! That the surgeon too must 'cut correctly' if he is to save the patient! And that Lenin too had to take into account all the elements of a conjuncture before fixing the correct line of political action. Now, there is something behind all these objections: a pragmatist representation of action, according to which all these 'adjusters' adjust their part, their political line, their intervention to obtain a result, attain an end that governs their action from the exterior. According to this representation, action is the action of a <I>subject</I> who 'adjusts' or 'tinkers with' [<I>bricole </I>] his intervention with an <I>end</I> in view - that is, for the achievement of an <I>aim</I> that 'exists in his head' to be realized in the external world. If we accept that argument, we deserve to be called pragmatists, subjectivists, voluntarists, etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is here that we must be careful with images. Of course the 'correctness' that results from an 'adjustment' is not unrelated to the practices invoked above, but that is primarily because this affinity of terms foregrounds the relation between 'correctness' and practice - in its differ-

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 105</B></FONT><P>

ence with another relation: between 'Truth' and theory. As for the rest, we will not allow ourselves to be trapped by these images. The mechanic who 'adjusts' his part knows very well that the motor pre-exists him and waits for his work to be completed to begin to run the engine again: it is completely external to him. So with the surgeon: it is certainly more complicated, but he is not part of the patient. In contrast, the political leader Lenin interests us for different reasons, and it is not by chance that we have borrowed his terms: 'drawing a line of demarcation', 'Thesis' (think of the 'April Theses') and 'correct'. These are political terms. But they suit our purposes, and it certainly suits our purposes that the practice which helps us to think the proper practice of philosophy as adequately as possible should be <I>political.</I> For in contrast to the mechanic and the surgeon, who are subjects who act on the basis of an 'idea in their mind' - (1) because they are <I>subjects</I> and (2) because this idea simply reflects the fact that the engine to be repaired or the patient to be operated on are <I>external</I>, 'existing outside their minds' - Lenin, the politician, the working-class leader, is well and truly <I>internal</I> to the conjuncture <I>in</I> which he must act if he is to be able to act <I>on</I> it. This is why Lenin's practice is not pragmatist (and hence subjectivist-voluntarist). He is not a 'subject' who has 'in mind' an 'idea that he will carry out' and wants to realize externally: he is the leader of a class struggle organization, the vanguard of the popular masses, and in so far as he defines a 'correct line' 'one step ahead of the masses and one step only', he is simply reflecting in order to inflect <I>a balance of forces in which he participates and takes sides.</I> Formally speaking, the philosophical practice that we have attempted to think under the Leninist terms 'drawing a line of demarcation', 'Theses', 'correct', etc., is thus on the same side as Lenin's practice: practical, but not pragmatist. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The fact remains, however, that philosophy is not simply politics. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If, at least on the basis of the positions that we are defending, philosophical practice 'functions' in many respects <I>like</I> Lenin's political practice, we must support ourselves on this 'like' to see over the wall: to see beyond how philosophy 'functions' in its own domain; to see how it functions <I>philosophically.</I> We must proceed further in the determination of the specificity of philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To do so, we must return to two of our Theses.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;It is necessary to take seriously the fact that philosophy states <I>theoretical</I> propositions (philosophy is 'part' of 'theory') and that it intervenes in 'theory' - that is, in the sciences, in philosophy and in theoretical ideologies: it is this which distinguishes it from all other practices, including political practice. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 106</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;We must restate Thesis 22: all the lines of demarcation traced by philosophy are ultimately modalities of a fundamental line: the line between the scientific and the ideological.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Remember my example of interdisciplinarity. It showed us how philosophy 'functions': by tracing lines of demarcation, making distinctions to clear the correct way, provoking new questions, and therefore new lines <I>ad infinitum.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Our analysis of this example has brought out three points:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   1.&nbsp;Philosophy functions by intervening not in matter (the mechanic), or on a living body (the surgeon), or in the class struggle (the politician), but <I>in theory </I>:  not with tools or a scalpel or through the organization and leadership of the masses, but simply by stating <I>theoretical</I> propositions (Theses), rationally adjusted and justified. This intervention in theory provokes <I>theoretical</I> effects: the positions of new philosophical interventions, etc., and <I>practical</I> effects on the balance of power between the 'ideas' in question.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   2.&nbsp;Philosophy intervenes in a certain reality: 'theory'. This notion perhaps remains a little vague, but we know what interests us in it. Philosophy intervenes in the indistinct reality in which the sciences, theoretical ideologies and philosophy itself figure. What are theoretical ideologies? Let us advance a provisional definition: they are, in the last instance, and even when they are unrecognizable as such, forms of practical ideologies, transformed within theory.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   3.&nbsp;The result of philosophical intervention, such as we have conceived it, is to draw, in this indistinct reality, a line of demarcation that separates, in each case, the scientific from the ideological. This line of demarcation may be completely covered over, denied or effaced in most philosophies: it is essential to their existence, despite the denegation. Its denegation is simply the common form of its existence.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This analysis therefore brings out three essential terms:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   1.&nbsp;the intervention of philosophy; 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   2.&nbsp;the reality in which this intervention takes place; 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   3.&nbsp;the result of this intervention.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I will go right to the heart of things by saying that the enigma of philosophy is contained in the difference between the reality in which it intervenes (the domain of the <I>sciences</I> + theoretical <I>ideologies</I> + philos-

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 107</B></FONT><P>

ophy) and the result that its intervention produces (the distinction between the <I>scientific</I> and the <I>ideological </I>). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This difference appears in the form of a difference between <I>words.</I> But (note the paradox!) the words that we employ to designate the 'reality' in which . . ., and the words we use to designate the 'result' of the line we have drawn, are <I>virtually the same </I>:  on the one hand, the sciences and theoretical ideologies; on the other, the scientific and the ideological. On the one hand, nouns; on the other, their adjectival forms. Is this not the same thing? Are we not repeating in the result what we already have in the reality? It would seem that the same characters are in opposition: sometimes in the form of nouns, sometimes in the form of adjectives. Is this not simply a nominal distinction, a terminological difference and therefore merely apparent? Is the result produced by the philosophical intervention really distinguished from the reality in which it intervenes, if it is already inscribed in that reality? In other words, does not the whole of philosophy consist simply in repeating, in the same words, what is already inscribed in reality? Hence in modifying words without producing anything new? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Yes, philosophy does act by modifying words and their order. But they are theoretical words, and it is this difference between words that allows something <I>new</I> in reality, something that was hidden and covered over, to appear and <I>be seen.</I> The expression <I>the scientific</I> is not identical to the expression the sciences; the expression <I>the ideological</I> is not identical to the expression <I>theoretical ideologies.</I> The new expressions do not reproduce the older ones: they bring to light a contradictory couple, a <I>philosophical</I> couple. The sciences are sciences: they are not philosophy. Theoretical ideologies are theoretical ideologies: they are not reducible to philosophy. But 'the scientific' and 'the ideological' are <I>philosophical</I> categories and the contradictory couple they form is brought to light by philosophy: it is philosophical. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  A strange conclusion, but we have to cling to it. We said: philosophy intervenes in this indistinct <I>reality </I>:  the sciences + theoretical ideologies. And we discover that the <I>result</I> of the philosophical intenention, the line that reveals the scientific and the ideological by separating them, <I>is entirely philosophical.</I> A contradiction? No. For philosophy intervenes in reality only by producing results <I>within itself.</I> It acts <I>outside of itself</I> through the result that it produces <I>within itself.</I> It will be necessary to attempt to think through this necessary paradox one day. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us be content to record it with a new Thesis. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <I>Thesis 23.</I>&nbsp;The distinction between the scientific and the ideological is internal to philosophy. It is the result of a philosophical intervention. Philosophy is inseparable from its result, which constitutes the <I>philosophy-effect.</I> The philosophy-effect is different from the 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 108</B></FONT><P>

knowledge-effect (produced by the sciences). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But at the same time let us keep in mind that this internal result (the philosophy-effect) is inseparable from the intervention of philosophy in reality = the sciences + theoretical ideologies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The first element in this reality is familiar to us: the sciences. They have a recognized historical existence and scientists are witnesses not only to their existence but to their practices, problems and their findings as well. The second element is not so familiar to us: <I>theoretical ideologies.</I> We will provisionally leave this element on one side. Because it would take a long analysis to attain knowledge of it: we would have to sketch out a theory of ideologies culminating in a distinction between practical ideologies (religious, moral, juridical, political, aesthetic, etc.), and theoretical ideologies, and in a theory of the relations between these two. But also because we will begin to get an initial idea of the theoretical ideologies as we go along. And finally because it is <I>indispensable</I> to dwell for some time on the philosophical question of the existence of the sciences and of scientific practice, before we can approach the problem of ideology. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This last reason is neither one of convenience nor simply of method. It not only concerns the theoretical ideologies, it is primarily concerned with philosophy itself. For we can advance only on one condition: that we enlighten philosophy as to its own nature. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I will therefore advance at this point a central Thesis that is going to command the remainder of this course. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 24.</I>&nbsp;The relation between philosophy and the sciences constitutes the <I>specific</I> determination of philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I do not say: determination in the last instance, or primary determination, etc. Philosophy has other determinations that play a fundamental role in its existence, its functioning and its forms (for example, its relation with the world-views through practical or theoretical ideologies). I say <I>specific</I>, for it is proper to philosophy and pertains to it <I>alone.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We must be quite clear as to what is meant by the relation of philosophy to the sciences. It does not mean that <I>only</I> philosophy <I>speaks</I> of the sciences. Science figures in other discourses: for example, religion, ethics and politics all speak of science. But they do not speak of it as does philosophy, because their relation to the sciences does not constitute the specific determination of religion, ethics, politics, literature. It is not their relation to the sciences that constitutes them as religion, ethics, etc. Similarly, that does not mean that philosophy speaks <I>only</I> of the sciences! It speaks, as everyone knows, of everything and of nothing (of nothingness), of religion, ethics, politics, literature, etc. The relation of philosophy to the sciences is not that of a discourse to its 'specific'

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 109</B></FONT><P>

themes, or even to its 'object' (since philosophy has no object). This relation is <I>constitutive</I> of the specificity of philosophy. <I>Outside of its relationship to the sciences, philosophy would not exist.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In what remains of this lecture, I will restrict myself to commenting on Thesis 24. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I am going to adopt the only method possible in an introduction: proceeding by <I>empirical</I> analyses with the sole purpose of <I>showing</I>, making perceptible by <I>facts</I>, this specific relation and its importance. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I insist on this precise point: <I>empirical</I> analyses. Naturally, there is no such thing as a <I>pure</I> empirical analysis. Every analysis, even an empirical analysis, presupposes a minimum of theoretical references without which it would be impossible to present what are called facts: otherwise, we would not know why we accept and recognize them as <I>facts.</I> But to analyse the 'functioning' of philosophy in its relation to the sciences empirically is insufficient to furnish a <I>theory</I> of philosophy: that is merely a preliminary to such a theory. In a theory of philosophy, other realities (for example, practical ideologies) and other relations (relations of production) must also be taken into account. And it is above all necessary to 're-examine' the findings of empirical analyses from the viewpoint of the <I>overall</I> function (or functions) of philosophy in the history of social formations, which does not contradict empirical findings but rather <I>transforms</I> their meaning. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In this inquiry into the relation of philosophy to the sciences, we shall now explore the scientific side of things.

<P>
How does the relation of philosophy to the sciences appear on the side of the sciences or, more precisely, on the side of scientific practice? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Thesis 25.</I>&nbsp;In their scientific practice, specialists from different disciplines 'spontaneously' recognize the existence of philosophy and the privileged relation of philosophy to the sciences. This recognition is generally unconscious: it can, in certain circumstances, become partially conscious. But it remains enveloped in the <I>forms</I> proper to unconscious recognition: these forms constitute the 'spontaneous philosophies of scientists' or '<I>savants </I>' (SPS). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To clarify this Thesis I will begin with a case in which this recognition is (partially) conscious. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The most famous and striking example of this recognition is furnished by the particular situations called 'crises'. At a certain moment in its development, a science confronts scientific problems which cannot be 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 110</B></FONT><P>

resolved by the existing theoretical means or (and) that call into question the coherence of the earlier theory. As a first approximation, we might speak either of a contradiction between a new problem and the existing theoretical means, or (and) of a disturbance of the entire theoretical edifice. These contradictions can be lived as 'critical' or even dramatic moments by scientists [<I>savants </I>] (cf. the correspondence of Borel, Le Besgue, Hadamard). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Everyone knows famous examples of scientific 'crises': the crisis of irrational numbers in Greek mathematics, the crisis of modern physics at the end of the nineteenth century, the crisis triggered in modern mathematics and mathematical logic by early set theory (between Cantorian theory and that of Zermelo, 1900-08).

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  How do <I>savants</I> 'live' these crises? What are their reactions? How are they expressed consciously, by what words, what discourse? How did they act when faced with these 'crises that shake science'? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Three kinds of reaction may be noted. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <I>First reaction.</I> This is the reaction of scientists [<I>savants </I>] who keep a cool head and confront the problems of science without abandoning the realm of science. They struggle as best they can with their scientific difficulties and attempt to resolve them. If need be they accept their inability to see clearly and advance into the darkness. They do not lose confidence. For them the 'crisis' is not a 'crisis of Science' that calls science itself into question; it is rather a temporary episode, a test. Because in general they have no sense of history, they do not say that every scientific crisis is a 'growth crisis', but in practical terms they act as though it were. In the great 'crisis' of physics in the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, we see certain <I>savants</I> of this type resisting the general contagion and refusing to accept the latest word: 'matter has disappeared'. But they were swimming against the tide, and were not always very happy about arguing the case.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <I>Second reaction.</I> At the other extreme may be seen another kind of scientists [<I>savants </I>] who do lose their heads. The 'crisis' catches them by surprise, unprepared or, without even knowing it, so prejudiced that their convictions are badly shaken; everything collapses around them and, in their panic, they call into question not simply a given scientific concept or theory so as to rectify or reformulate it, but the validity of their practice itself: the 'value of science'. Instead of remaining determinedly in the field of science to confront its unforeseen, surprising and even disconcerting problems, they go over to 'the other side', leaving the scientific domain to consider it <I>from the outside </I>:  it is thus <I>from the outside</I> that they render the judgement of 'crisis' and the word they pronounce takes on a different meaning. Previously, 'crisis' meant in

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 111</B></FONT><P>

practice: growing pains, or signs, perhaps critical, that a science was about to be recast. Now 'crisis' means the shattering of <I>scientific principles</I>, the fragility of the discipline - or, better still, the radical precariousness of any possible scientific knowledge because it is a human enterprise and, like human beings, limited, finite and prone to error. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And so these <I>savants</I> begin to do philosophy. It may not be very lofty, but it is philosophy. Their way of 'living' the crisis is to become 'philosophers' <I>in order to exploit it.</I> For they do not do just any philosophy. Especially when they think they have invented something new, they are simply picking up, as best they can, snatches and the refrains of the old <I>spiritualist</I> philosophical song, which is always lying in wait for the difficulties of 'science', so as to exploit its reversals, to lead it back to and confine it within its 'limits' as proof of human vanity, and which, from the depths of its nothingness, pays tribute to Spirit by admitting its defeats. It is scientists that we have to thank, for example, for the announcement of the latest news about the 'crisis' in modern physics: 'matter has disappeared!', 'the atom is free!' But religious spiritualism does not always speak so clearly in proclaiming the defeat of 'matter' and of 'necessity'. It also uses other discourses which confine science within its 'limits' to curb and control its pretensions. Restrictions on the 'rights' of science: to ensure that it remains within <I>its</I> borders (it is taken for granted that <I>someone</I> has established them from the outside, in advance and for ever, and by 'right'). Here again, the <I>savants</I> who adopt this discourse on the 'crisis' fall back upon an old agnostic-spiritualist tradition: but we have known since Pascal and Kant that behind the borders assigned science by philosophy there lurks religion. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These reactions offer us an unanticipated spectacle. In our naivety we thought it was philosophers who produced philosophy. But in a 'crisis' situation we discover that <I>savants</I> themselves can begin to 'manufacture' philosophy. <I>Inside every savant</I>, <I>their sleeps a philosopher</I>, who will awaken at the first opportunity. And perhaps in a pure religious delirium. Like Teilhard de Chardin, palaeontologist and priest, authentic scientist [<I>savant </I>] and authentic clergyman, exploiting science for the profit of his faith: directly. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But whilst these scientists [<I>savants </I>] who awaken as philosophers may prove that a philosopher sleeps in every scientist, they also demonstrate that the philosophy which speaks through them is, give or take a few individual variations, never anything more than a repetition of an unbroken spiritualist tradition in the history of philosophy which, as it does with all forms of human misery, throws itself upon the 'crisis' of sciences in order to exploit them to apologetic, ultimately religious, ends (Bergson, Brunschvicg, etc.). We must be aware that our history is profoundly marked, and remains so today, by a whole philosophical 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 112</B></FONT><P>

tradition that lies in wait for the difficulties, contradictions and crises internal to the sciences, because there are so many weaknesses that it can use (that is, exploit) - <I>ad majorem Dei gloriam</I> - just like Pascal who was, however, an authentic scientist, but used his science to justify his philosophy; and just like those members of the clergy who await the approach of death to throw themselves at the dying unbeliever and inflict on him, in his agony, the last rites (for his salvation, obviously, but also for the salvation of religion). It is necessary to know that there is within philosophy a whole tradition that survives only by the ideological exploitation of human suffering - of the sick or the dying, of cataclysms and wars - that hurries towards every crisis, including the crises that strike the sciences. It is difficult not to relate this <I>ideological</I> exploitation to another form of exploitation which has, since Marx, been known as the exploitation of man by man. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In the 'crisis' of a science, certain <I>savants</I> whose convictions have been shaken can thus be seen joining the ranks of those philosophers who want to 'save' science in their own way: by 'forgiving' it 'for it knows not what it does' - that is, by condemning it to its nothingness or to its limits, upon which may be built the kingdom of God or of the Spirit and its freedom. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The philosophy that we propose does not seek the 'salvation' of science. It invites scientists to distrust any philosophy that seeks the 'salvation' of science. It professes, on the contrary, that the question of 'salvation' is religious and has nothing to do with science and its practice; that the 'health' of science is the business of science itself; it has confidence in scientists to solve their own problems, no matter how 'critical'. Scientists should above all count on their own forces: but <I>their</I> forces are not a matter for them alone; a good proportion of these forces exists <I>elsewhere</I> - in the world of men, in their labour, their struggles and their ideas. I will add: philosophy - not just any philosophy, not that which exploits the sciences, but that which serves them - plays, or can play, a role here.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Third reaction.</I> Leave on one side the two extremes: scientists who continue their work and those who believe the 'divine surprise'<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> that 'matter has disappeared'. There remains a third type of scientist. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   They too set out to do philosophy. They too 'live' the 'crisis', not as

the contradiction of a process of the recasting and growth of scientific practice and theory, but as a <I>philosophical</I> question. They too leave the field of science and, from the outside, ask science philosophical 'questions' about the conditions of the validity of its practice and its findings; about its <I>foundations</I> and <I>qualifications.</I> But they are not simply content, like the others, to place the homage of their defeats on the steps of the Temple. They are critical not so much of science and its practices as of the naive philosophical ideas in which they <I>discover</I> that they had hitherto lived. They recognize that the 'crisis' has awakened them from their 'dogmatism': or better, they <I>recognize</I>, <I>after the event</I>, once they are awakened to philosophy, that <I>because they are scientists</I>, <I>a philosopher has always slept within them.</I> But they have turned against the philosophy of that philosopher, condemning it as 'dogmatic', 'mechanistic', 'naive' and, in a word, as 'materialist'. In short, they condemn it as a bad philosophy of science and consequently attempt to give science the philosophy it lacks: <I>the good philosophy of science.</I> For them, the crisis is the <I>effect</I>, within science, of the <I>bad philosophy of scientists which, until then</I>, <I>reigned over science.</I> All they have to do now is to start working. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I said: these scientists too leave the realm of science. For us, this is true. But for them, no. As far as they are concerned, they remain <I>in</I> science and do not repudiate it. Indeed, they invoke their experience of their scientific practice, their experience of their scientific 'experience'. They invoke their scientific knowledge and it is <I>from within</I> science that they claim to speak of science, that they set out to manufacture, <I>with scientific arguments</I> borrowed from the sciences - physics, psycho-physiology, biology - the good philosophy of science that science is claimed to need. And who is better placed than a scientist to speak of science and its practice? <I>A scientific philosophy of science</I> made <I>by scientists.</I> What more could anyone reasonably ask for? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Such is the spectacle furnished by the 'crisis' in modern physics at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth: the appearance of the great <I>savants</I> Ostwald and Mach who, together with many scientists, attempted to provide <I>science</I> with the good scientific philosophy it needed to be able to 'criticize', 'overcome' and 'abolish' the cause of its crisis - the bad philosophy that scientists had in their heads and which 'caused science so much trouble' - in a word, <I>materialism.</I> Along with a number of other systems, Ostwald's energeticism and Mach's empirio-criticism are testimony to this prodigious adventure. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is at this point that the situation is reversed, and becomes clear. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For note well this little fact: these <I>savants</I> who fashion a <I>savant</I>'s philosophy for science are not the only people to enter the lists! They 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 114</B></FONT><P>

find an entire battalion of philosophers - and some major ones at that - at their side, playing the chorus, repeating their 'scientific' arguments, and lending them a hand in their search for the philosopher's stone. Thus Avenarius, Bogdanov and a score of others. Why? It is simple. This philosophy of scientists, scientific and critical, possessed all that was necessary to seduce philosophers, for it was <I>critical.</I> In one sense, because it <I>criticized</I> the illusions of the bad, 'dogmatist' and 'materialist' philosophy of previous scientists. But also in another sense: because it proposed, in sum, to elucidate, under phenomena, the conditions of possibility which guarantee that scientific knowledge is truly the knowledge of the object of <I>its</I> 'experience', and which therefore found a <I>critical</I> Theory of Knowledge. Something to gratify philosophers who, since Kant, have had a weakness for 'criticism', and 'do' it in every possible variant of the critical theory of knowledge. Is it surprising that they supported Mach? They simply recognized themselves as <I>philosophers</I> in his <I>scientist</I>'s philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But if they recognize themselves in his philosophy, it is because they are <I>at home</I> there. And because <I>savant</I>-philosophers who believe they can extract their philosophy <I>purely</I> from their experience as scientists, and <I>purely</I> from their scientific knowledges, are simply <I>endorsing</I> a variation on the classical themes of the dominant philosophy, the 'philosophy of philosophers', in a language and with examples that appear to be new. These philosophers may believe they are doing revolutionary work, but even a little knowledge of the history of philosophy is enough to set the record straight. For these philosophies of scientists are, <I>at bottom</I>, not new at all but in line with a long tradition, and they give it both a new form and a new lease of life. The philosophies of science of Mach and Ostwald, for example, are merely new presentations of old and well-known philosophical tendencies: they are variants, admixtures, combinations - sometimes extremely ingenious - of empiricism, nominalism, pragmatism, criticism, etc., and, therefore, of <I>idealism.</I> Their endeavours are underwritten by the entire constellation of the themes of British <I>empiricism</I> of the eighteenth century, which was dominated by Kantian criticism, combined with the 'scientific findings' of the physics of sensation of the nineteenth century. For it so happens that when late-nineteenth-century bourgeois ideology, for reasons which surpass a simple 'crisis' of physics because they are fundamentally <I>political</I>, staged the great 'return to Kant' that took it beyond Hegel and positivism, the <I>savant</I>-philosophers who thought they were swimming against the current were, without realizing it, being carried along and carried away by the current. It is hardly surprising that some philosophers followed their example, for they had all been swept away by the same current: that of the dominant philosophy in its 'return to Kant'.

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 115</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The philosophies of scientists provoked by the 'crisis' in '<I>Science </I>' belong by rights to the history of <I>philosophy</I> which, without their knowing it, sustains them: they do not derive from a theory of the history of the sciences but from a theory of the history of philosophy, its tendencies, its currents and its conflicts. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Scientists in the grip of the 'crisis' means, more prosaically, scientists in the grip of philosophy. Let us say: when there arise scientific difficulties, internal to science and provoked by its contradictory growth, some scientists suddenly <I>discover</I> that they had always had a philosophy within them, and criticize it <I>only</I> to replace it with another - to them better - philosophy. We may translate: whereas others hasten to exploit the recasting of a science for religious ends, they declare science to be 'in crisis' and, having pronounced the verdict of 'crisis', fall headlong into what must be called a philosophical 'crisis' of their own. All this creates quite a row and since, in the world of the dominant ideology, it is the chanting in unison that makes something true, it is not surprising that it took someone as straightforward and cool-headed as Lenin, who had been formed in the class struggle, brutally to break the 'spell' of these complicities and to condemn the imposture.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp">2</A>]</FONT> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  One last word: what about those scientists who continue working through the night of their ordeal and who, without exploiting the 'crisis' in science, either keep quiet or defend themselves with whatever words they possess, but remain determined to resolve their problems and contradictions? Are they philosophers too? And what kind? We shall see.

<P>
We may now return to our analysis. What have we done? We have grasped the <I>empirical</I> opportunity provided by an event observable in certain circumstances in the history of the sciences: that which is declared the 'crisis' of a science. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For in an experience like a 'crisis', something that is ordinarily concealed in shadow or written in small letters appears in the broad light of day or, as Plato said, written in capital letters. The 'crisis' acts as a 'developer' and shows clearly something that remains hidden, unrecognized or disavowed in the course of the everyday life of the sciences. Namely the fact that in every scientist there sleeps a philosopher or, to put it another way, that every scientist is affected by an ideology or a scientific philosophy which we propose to call by the conventional name: <I>the spontaneous philosophy of the scientists</I> (abbreviated as SPS).

</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 116</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We say that all scientists are, unbeknownst to them, permanently affected by it, even when there is no 'crisis' to make manifest revelations. '<I>No crisis </I>': to put it simply, this SPS functions silently and can take forms other than the spectacular forms typical of crises. '<I>Unbeknownst to them </I>': this must be said even of the spectacular philosophical forms of crises, for the scientists who suddenly set out to manufacture a philosophy of science, to construct 'the philosophy of science' needed to bring science out of its 'crisis', <I>no more believe in the existence of an SPS than the others </I>:  they think they are simply denouncing a materialist philosophical <I>intrusion</I> into the sciences and giving science the philosophy it needs, by reacting to an <I>accident</I> that happened outside science, for they see science in its normal state as a pure science, free from any SPS. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We say that this SPS takes silent and invisible forms in the 'normal' course of scientific practice and spectacular forms in the case of a 'crisis' - which leads us to question the very meaning of the term 'scientific crisis'. Are there really 'scientific crises' that are not simply, as Lenin argued, 'growth crises', crises which, far from being <I>critical</I>, are on the contrary productive? And if there is such a 'crisis', is it not necessary to return the term against its authors - that is, against those who, one fine day, announce to the world that 'modern physics' or 'set theory' is 'in crisis'? After all, it is <I>they</I> who pronounce the judgement of 'crisis'! And it must be asked if all this takes place inside their heads - that is, in the ideologico-philosophical reaction they experience jubilation or fear) before the emergence of a certain number of unforeseen or disconcerting <I>scientific</I> problems. Crisis for crisis: it must be asked if the crisis - not the productive crisis, but the <I>critical</I> crisis - far from being a crisis in science, is not rather a crisis of their own making and, in so far as they live the crisis in philosophy, <I>simply their philosophical crisis and nothing more.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If this is so, then our hypothesis is reinforced: all scientific practice is inseparable from a 'spontaneous philosophy' which may, depending upon which philosophy is involved, be a materialist aid or an idealist obstacle; that this spontaneous philosophy alludes, 'in the last instance', to the secular struggle that unfolds on the battlefield (<I>Kampfplatz</I>, Kant<FONT SIZE=-2>[3]</FONT>) of the history of philosophy between idealist tendencies and materialist tendencies; and that the forms of this struggle are themselves governed by other more distant forms, those of the ideological struggle

(between or within practical ideologies) and those of the class struggle. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is to the forms of the class struggle that we must turn if we are really to understand what happens in the 'critique' of modern physics and the 'spontaneous philosophy of scientists' that reflects it. For why, in the last resort, have the scientific events of the development of modern physics taken the form of a 'crisis' and given rise to the exemplary discourses of neo-Kantian philosophy? It is because 'Kant is in the air', because the conjuncture has imposed a 'return to Kant'. The conjuncture . . . after the great fear and the massacres of the Commune, bourgeois philosophers and ideologues and later, surrendering to the contagion, the ideologues of the labour movement itself, began to celebrate the 'return to Kant' so as to struggle against 'materialism': the materialism of scientific practice and that of the proletarian class struggle. When modern physics becomes conscious of unforeseen and contradictory problems, it is merely taking its place in a pre-existing current that 'tails the movement'; while the scientists who have constructed neo-Kantian philosophy believe themselves to be the vanguard of history. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To denounce this mystification we need nothing less than Lenin (<I>Materialism and Empirio-criticism </I>). I have on several occasions cited Lenin in connection with philosophy. We know that this political leader (who described himself as an amateur in philosophy)<FONT SIZE=-2>[4]</FONT> had a fairly good idea of what it is to struggle and of what relation links the political to the philosophical struggle, since he knew how to intervene (and who else did it? No one!) in this difficult matter, and to trace the appropriate lines of demarcation to open the way to a correct position of the problems of the 'crisis'. And at the same time, by way of example, he gave us the means to understand the practice of philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In other words, without Lenin and all that we owe him, this philosophy course for scientists could never have taken place.

Now we are heading out to sea. Not only did we embark suddenly, without warning. We have already come a long way, or so it would seem, and we are already in uncharted waters. It is time to take our bearings in order better to know where we have come from and where we are going. But first, we must work out how far we have come. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We are still steering towards the question: <I>what about philosophy </I>? (I say <I>what about </I>?, instead of <I>what is </I>?, to satisfy certain philosophers who are irritated beyond measure by the question what is? But these are intra-philosophical matters, and I will not bore you with the details.) 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We have been hugging the shores of the history of the sciences as closely as possible. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Why this cruise along the 'scientific shores'? Because we thought we could advance the Thesis that the relationship with the sciences constitutes what is <I>specific</I> to philosophy (remember: its specific determinant, not its determinant in the last instance). It is this Thesis that we are attempting to justify. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It was to this end that we took a look at what occurs in what seemed to us a privileged, because revealing, experience (or even experiment?) of what is known as a 'crisis in the sciences'. And from this we drew a certain number of conclusions that are undoubtedly difficult for our scientific friends to accept: we hit them with the 'revelation' that they have always been affected by a 'spontaneous philosophy of scientists', even when they were not wearing the historical hat of the Great Scientist Philosophers who, believing themselves 'assigned' to a historical Mission unprecedented in the history of philosophy, are simply chewing over, like hard-working but ingenious subordinates, the leftovers of an old philosophical meal which the ideological contradictions of the epoch made dominant and obligatory. By inflicting this 'revelation' on them we 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 120</B></FONT><P>

have undoubtedly fallen foul of their convictions, their honesty - even if it is cloaked in a certain naivety (after all, to replace one cartoon image with another, whilst we recognized that philosophers are ridiculous characters who 'fall into wells' and drew conclusions from this, scientists are well aware that even if they do not fall in their disciplines as philosophers do in theirs, they do not always have their feet 'on the ground', but rather a certain naivety in their heads). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is time to step back from this experience. If they examine these conclusions from a safe distance, our scientific friends will find that things fall into place, and that we will render them the justice they may fear we are denying them. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   From this distance, what are we to retain of our analysis of the phenomena that the 'crises' of the 'sciences' 'reveal'? Two discoveries, two themes of the utmost importance:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#L3.1">1</A>.&nbsp;There is such a thing as the <I>exploitation</I> of the sciences by philosophy.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#L3.2">2</A>.&nbsp;There is within the 'consciousness' or the 'unconscious' of scientists such a thing as a <I>spontaneous philosophy of scientists</I> (SPS).

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I will now take up these two points.


<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>I&nbsp;T</FONT>HE <FONT SIZE=+1>E</FONT>XPLOITATION OF THE 
<FONT SIZE=+1>S</FONT>CIENCES BY <FONT SIZE=+1>P</FONT>HILOSOPHY

</B></CENTER>

<P>
More precisely: the vast majority of philosophies have always exploited the sciences for apologetic ends, ends extrinsic to the interests of scientific practice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Note well: I am saying nothing new. I am merely taking up a theme that was evoked in relation to the 'crisis' of the sciences, specifically when I spoke of the reaction of the <I>second type</I> of scientist (the spiritualists who turn the failure of science <I>ad majorem Dei gloriam</I>, as they do all human misery and suffering). But in taking up this theme, I will <I>generalize</I> it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And to give it its general meaning, I am obliged to say: the vast <I>majority</I> of known philosophies have, throughout the history of philosophy, always <I>exploited</I> the sciences (and not simply their failures) to the profit of the 'values' (a provisional term) of <I>practical ideologies </I>: religious, moral, juridical, aesthetic, political, etc. This is one of the <I>essential</I> characteristics of idealism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If this proposition is true, it must be capable of being concretely illustrated, and this is the case.

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 121</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I believe there is no need to dwell at length on the example of <I>religious</I> philosophies (dominated by religious ideology). All the scientific genius of Pascal did not prevent him from deriving beautifully eloquent flourishes of rhetoric, dedicated to the (slightly heretical) Christianity he professed, from the contradictions of the mathematical infinite itself, and from the religious 'terror' inspired in him by the new (Galilean) 'infinite spaces' of a world of which man was no longer the centre and from which God was 'absent' - which made it necessary, in order to save the very idea of God, to say that He was in essence a '<I>hidden</I> God' (because He was no longer anywhere to be found - neither in the world, nor in its order, nor its morality: one can only wait to be touched by His unpredictable and impenetrable grace). I say: all the genius of Pascal, for he was a very great scientist and, what is extremely rare (a paradox that must be pondered), an astonishing, almost materialist, philosopher of scientific practice. But he was too alone in his time, and like everyone else was subject to such contradictions, such stakes and such a balance of power (think of the violence of his struggle against the Jesuits) that he could not avoid the obligatory 'solution', which was also no doubt a consolation to him, of resolving <I>in religion</I> (his own) the most general and conflict-ridden contradictions of a science in which he laboured as a genuine materialist practitioner. And so, together with some admirable texts (on mathematics, on scientific experimentation), Pascal left us the corpus of a <I>religious philosophy</I> of which it must be said that its inspiration is the exploitation of the great theoretical contradictions of the sciences of his time to apologetic ends external to the sciences. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Next to a giant like Pascal, what is to be said in our time of a Teilhard? The same thing, but without being able to find anything in his work to counterbalance the vacuous and deluded enterprise of a palaeontologist dressed in a cassock who prides himself on being a priest as he draws risky conclusions from his science: open exploitation 'for the sake of heaven above'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The case of <I>spiritualist</I> philosophies is a little more complex. They do not have the disconcerting, even moving, simplicity of certain religious philosophies. They are more cunning, for they do not pursue their ends directly but make a detour through the <I>philosophical categories</I> elaborated in the history of philosophy: Spirit, Soul, Freedom, the Good, the Beautiful, Values, etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And because at this point I bring the history of philosophy to bear, note well that all the philosophies of which we are speaking are still <I>contemporary </I>: we still have among us 'representatives' of religious philosophy, spiritualist philosophy, idealist-critical philosophy, neo-positivism, materialism, etc. But these philosophies do not share the same 'date of birth' and most have not <I>always</I> existed. New philosophies have 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 122</B></FONT><P>

appeared <I>in opposition</I> to the older ones: they have prevailed over them in historical struggle. But the characteristic feature of this singular 'history' of philosophy is that the new philosophy that 'prevails over' an older one, which it comes to dominate after a long and difficult struggle, <I>does not destroy the older one</I>, which lives on beneath this domination and thus survives indefinitely, most often in a subordinate role, but sometimes recalled by the conjuncture to the front of the stage. If this is the case, it is because the 'history' of philosophy 'proceeds' very differently from the history of the sciences. In the history of the sciences a double process is constantly in play: the process of <I>the pure and simple elimination of errors</I> (which disappear totally) and the process of the <I>reinscription</I> of earlier theoretical elements and knowledges in the context of <I>newly</I> acquired knowledges and newly constructed theories. In sum, a double 'dialectic': the total elimination of 'errors' and the integration of earlier findings, still valid but transformed, into the theoretical system of the new insights. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The history of philosophy 'proceeds' very differently: via a <I>struggle for domination</I> by the new philosophical forms against those that were once dominant. The history of philosophy is a struggle between tendencies realized in philosophical formations, and it is always a struggle for domination. But the paradox is that this struggle results only in the replacement of one domination by another, and not in the pure and simple elimination of a past formation (as '<I>error </I>': for there is no error in philosophy, in the sense that there is in the sciences) - that is, of the adversary. The adversary is never totally defeated and <I>therefore never totally suppressed</I>, totally <I>erased from historical existence.</I> It is only dominated and it lives on under the domination of the new philosophical formation that has overcome it after a very protracted battle: it lives on as a <I>dominated</I> philosophical formation, and is naturally ready to re-emerge whenever the conjuncture gives the signal and furnishes the occasion. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These remarks were of course necessary to give the real meaning of our analysis of the different philosophical formations that we are examining. It is not a question of simply <I>enumerating</I> philosophies, asking why they exist or subsist alongside one another, but rather of examining the philosophical formations which, old as they may be, still exist today in subordinate but still living forms, dominated by other formations which have conquered in struggle, or are in the process of conquering, something that must be called 'power'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I will now return to spiritualist philosophies. Not to give their 'date of birth', but to show that they were <I>dominant</I> throughout the entire period that preceded the establishment of bourgeois relations (to say nothing of their 'roots' in Antiquity): under feudalism, in the Middle Ages, only to

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 123</B></FONT><P>

be dominated subsequently by bourgeois idealist philosophy, from which they did not fail to take some of their own arguments, divorced from their classical idealist meanings (there is thus, as we shall see, a 'spiritualist interpretation' of Descartes, Kant, Husserl, etc.). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What distinguishes spiritualist philosophies from overtly religious philosophies is that they do not <I>directly</I> exploit the sciences (to speak only of what concerns us now) to the profit of overtly religious themes: <I>ad majorem Dei gloriam.</I> (They too may well pronounce the name of God, but it is the 'God of the philosophers' - a philosophical category.) They exploit the sciences for the profit of the Human Spirit, of Human Freedom, of Human Moral Values, etc. - or, bringing all these themes together, to the profit of the <I>Freedom</I> of the Human Spirit which, as everyone knows, is manifested in 'creation', be it scientific, moral, social, aesthetic or even religious. All philosophers know this. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But not only philosophers: for these philosophical themes, which famous academics have enshrined in 'immortal' works (and as nothing ever completely dies in philosophy, they do stand a chance of becoming immortal!), have passed into the 'vulgar' language of political speeches, sermons, magazine articles - in short, have ended up where all philosophy normally ends: in everyday life, to furnish arguments to justify the <I>practical</I> stands taken by these gentlemen. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Have we not heard enough about the '<I>suppl&eacute;ment d'&acirc;me </I>' (Bergson), which our 'mechanical civilization' (see Duhamel<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp123">1</A>]</FONT>), and now our 'consumer society', seems to 'need'? From the '<I>supplement d'&acirc;me </I>' to the 'quality of life', the way is short and direct. Surely we heard enough about the '<I>Freedom </I>' of the Spirit, of culture, of the creative power of the human mind, of the Great (moral!) Values that justify the existence and the defence of our 'civilization' which is, apparently, not simply an organization of production (industrial societies!) but 'a soul' which, of course, struggles as best it can against the intrusions of matter, yet remains what it always has been: <I>a soul</I> which, naturally enough, must be saved and defended (against whom? Against an intrusive materialism? Which one? The materialism that speaks of mechanized matter? That poses no real threat: if we use 'the standard of living' and 'participation' to improve the 'quality of life', we will get by; but the <I>other</I> materialism of political materialists united in struggle poses a very different kind of threat). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If we leave these 'lower' regions to ascend to the heights of our spiritualist philosophers, we will easily begin to see how their thought is constructed. Bergson's whole career as a spiritualist was based upon the

exploitation of the 'difficulties' or, in the sense that we have discussed it, of the 'crisis' in the theory of cerebral localizations (<I>Matter and Memory </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp124">2</A>]</FONT>), as well as modern physics (relativity) and Durkheimian sociology (<I>The Two Sources of Morality and Religion </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp124">3</A>]</FONT>). Pretexts for developing, in a multitude of forms and in a vocabulary renovated to the profit of Spirit, the antagonism between (material) space and (spiritual) duration. A singular destiny: at the very moment of the 'return to Kant' that gave birth to the different forms of neo-criticism, Bergson chose another way. He knew almost nothing about Kant, and if he did read Kant, he understood him badly because he did not want to understand him. Bergson 'works' the old spiritualist vein and exploits the sciences in a spiritualist mode, supplemented with new arguments and new categories (intuition, <I>le mouvant</I>, spiritual energy, etc.). The mode is different, the result the same. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Brunschvicg (who, like Bergson, but at a higher level, wielded real autocratic ideological power in the university) is <I>apparently</I> something else. A 'great mind' (at least as far as the history of modern French philosophy is concerned), who spoke incessantly of Spirit.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp124">4</A>]</FONT> The fact that he came to a miserable end in an occupied France whose government hunted down the Jews changes nothing of his official past. This man, who read Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Fichte, and Hegel, possessed an 'impressive' culture, historical (unlike Bergson) and scientific (albeit only second-hand). And this man seemed to belong to the great critical idealist tradition since, in his eyes, everything was contained in Kant and Fichte, so much so that he thought Aristotle and Hegel retarded ('the mental age of a twelve-year-old'). Brunschvicg, Kantian and critical thinker? That would be going too far. It is true that when he read Descartes, he never stopped relating him to Kant. But he read Kant through Spinoza, a strange Spinoza who would turn in his grave if he knew he was being read as a spiritualist! The truth is that all these references are false, because they are deceptive. Brunschvicg may well have constantly invoked Kant, but he was not a <I>critical</I> philosopher. One has only to look at the astonishing <I>m&eacute;lange</I> he made of Plato, Descartes, Spinoza and Kant to see the direction in which he <I>tended.</I> Brunschvicg was a spiritualist who (like many of his peers) knew how to make use of the prestige of certain arguments taken from the most disparate philosophers, and how to distort them for his own purposes. In the battle that is philosophy all the techniques of war, including

looting and camouflage, are permissible. And when it was necessary no longer simply to 'comment' on an author but to express an opinion about the facts of the history of the sciences (mathematics, causality in physics), Brunschvicg revealed his true colours. He too exploited the sciences to compose hymns to the Human Spirit, to the Freedom of the Spirit, to moral and aesthetic Creation. The fact that he did not believe in a <I>personal</I> God (the spiritualist existentialist-Christian Gabriel Marcel reproached him for this at a famous congress on philosophy in Paris in 1937) changes nothing: this was a minor conflict between a religious philosopher and a spiritualist philosopher. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Are other names necessary? When Paul Ricoeur writes a large book on psychoanalysis (<I>Freud and Philosophy </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp125">5</A>]</FONT>), a scientific discipline yet again pays the price of a 'demonstration' of Freedom borrowed, this time, not from Descartes or Kant, but from Husserl. When someone like Garaudy, who had his moment of power, claims to find in Marx's scientific work a notion of 'freedom' (Marxism is a theory of 'historical initiative', a formula borrowed from Fichte), however Marxist and materialist he declares himself to be, he remains no less a spiritualist.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp125">6</A>]</FONT> Others who abuse Marx to present his theory as 'humanist', however Marxist and materialist they declare themselves, are no less spiritualist. Lenin would have called them 'shamefaced' spiritualists, as this kind of spiritualism is hard to swallow and therefore hard to admit to. In every case, sciences (whether of nature, the unconscious, or history) are <I>exploited</I> by spiritualist philosophies for apologetic ends: to justify their 'objectives', no doubt because these 'objectives' are so lacking in guarantees that they must fraudulently obtain one from the prestige of the sciences. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  As I said a moment ago: in the case of overtly <I>religious</I> philosophies it is the practical ideology of <I>religion</I> that, thanks to the good offices of these philosophies, exploits the sciences, their difficulties, problems, concepts or their existence, to its own ends. But in the case of <I>spiritualist</I> philosophies? I advance the following thesis: it is <I>moral</I> practical ideology. And this is verifiable in that all spiritualist philosophies culminate in a commentary on the Good, in a Morality, a Wisdom that is nothing more than an exaltation of human Freedom, whether contemplative or practical (practice = morality); in the exaltation of a creative Freedom at once moral and aesthetic. At this highest level, the Beautiful of aesthetic creation and the Good of moral creation (or even

religious creation, in the sense that religion is the highest form of morality) exchange their weapons and their charms with the blessing of human Freedom and within its element. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I am well aware that <I>moral</I> practical ideology poses a problem, for it is most often 'floating' or 'drifting'. Either it is a by-product of social, economic, or political relations (for the Greek philosophers morality is a by-product of political ideology, and is political); or it is the by-product of religious ideology (as in the Middle Ages); or it is a by-product of juridical ideology (in the bourgeois period). In each of these cases, morality is an <I>ideological complement</I> or supplement that depends upon another ideology. Let us not forget, as we have seen in some of our authors, that morality may also be linked to an aesthetic ideology. But this practical ideology is in itself, in certain periods and conjunctures, endowed with a kind of privilege that permits it, through its <I>subordinate</I> form (which is nevertheless regarded as <I>autonomous</I> and <I>dominant </I>), to express 'values' that are difficult to defend, or at least difficult to defend in the name of an openly avowed practical ideology. To spell it out: when religion fails, it may be an advantage to be able to fall back upon morality: it makes no difference that the morality in question is bound up both with a declining religious ideology <I>and</I> with ascendant juridical ideology. To spell it out: when juridical ideology is too overt, and when espousing it might damage the cause you wish to defend, it may be an advantage to be able to fall back upon morality, its by-product, and to treat it as if it had more to do with religion than with juridical ideology, or, if not religion, then the Human Spirit and its freedom. Brunschvicg is typical of this latter case: he speaks of Freedom, but this is not the freedom of juridical ideology; it is another Freedom: the Freedom of the Human Spirit, which he slips in under the juridical by speaking simply of morality. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But we have not yet finished. For, in addition to religious philosophies and spiritualist philosophies, there remain the classical idealist philosophies from Descartes to Kant and Husserl: from <I>rationalist</I> idealism to <I>critical</I> idealism. As a first approximation, these philosophies may claim a very different 'relation' to the sciences from the religious and spiritualist philosophies. In fact, from Descartes to Husserl by way of Kant, this idealism can claim a real knowledge of scientific problems and a position with regard to the sciences that seems to demarcate it from other philosophies. Descartes himself was a mathematician; he gave his name to certain discoveries and wrote on 'method'. Kant denounced the imposture of 'sciences without an object', such as rational theology, rational psychology and rational cosmology; he took a close interest in problems of cosmology and of physics; in his <I>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science</I> he even inaugurated what

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 127</B></FONT><P>

would later be called epistemology. As for Husserl, we know that he was steeped in mathematics and mathematical logic. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  However, although in a different, infinitely less crude form this rationalist and critical idealism claims to recognize the rights of science, it none the less exploits the sciences. In all its variants, philosophy appears to be the discipline that <I>establishes the rights</I> of the sciences, for it <I>poses the question of rights</I> and answers it by defining <I>legal rights</I> to scientific knowledge. This philosophy appears in every case as the juridical guarantee of both the <I>rights</I> and <I>limits</I> of science. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is not by chance that the 'question of knowledge', and the corresponding 'theory of knowledge', have come (this has in no way always been the case) to occupy the central place in philosophy. Who will guarantee me that the (scientific) truth I possess is beyond doubt, that I am not being 'deceived' by a God who, like an 'evil demon', deceives me with the very obviousness of the presence of the true (Descartes)?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp127">7</A>]</FONT> <I>Who will guarantee me</I> that the 'conditions of experience' give me the truth of experience itself? What then are the <I>limits</I> of any possible experience (Kant)?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp127">8</A>]</FONT> What must be the 'modality' of consciousness <I>in order for</I> the object that is given to it to be 'present in person', and what is this 'consciousness' that is both 'my' 'concrete' consciousness and the consciousness of scientific ideality (Husserl)?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp127">9</A>]</FONT> Although these questions seem <I>preliminary</I>, concerning only questions of 'right', allowing the sciences their autonomy, they involve philosophy in a 'theory of knowledge' that unfailingly leads to a philosophy of <I>Science</I> in which philosophy 'states the truth' about science, the 'truth' of science in a theory that relates science a human activity like any other, to the system of human activities in which, purely by coincidence, Freedom is realized in Morality, Art, Religion, and politics. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is necessary to unmask the subtle deceptions of this rationalist-critical idealist procedure, which does not invoke the rights of science but asks science a <I>question of right</I> external to science in order to <I>furnish</I> its rightful qualifications: always from the outside. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What is this 'exterior'? Once again, a practical ideology. This time, <I>juridical</I> ideology. It might be said that the whole of bourgeois philosophy (or its great dominant representatives, for the subordinate tendencies that formulate religious or spiritualist philosophies behind the scenes must be given their due) is nothing more than a recapitulation of,

and a philosophical commentary on, bourgeois juridical ideology. No one can contest the fact that the 'question of right', which opens up the royal road to the classical theory of knowledge, is relatively foreign to ancient philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics and the core of scholasticism). If there is an element of a 'theory of knowledge' in these philosophies, it plays a subordinate and very different role to the role played by the 'theory of knowledge' of classical bourgeois philosophy. It is hardly open to argument that this 'question of right' at the heart of bourgeois philosophy itself is bound up with the domination of juridical ideology, although it is an unrecognized 'truth' - unrecognized for good reasons! But that the 'theory of knowledge' is entirely enclosed in the <I>presupposition</I> of this preliminary question, that the developments and therefore the results of this 'theory of knowledge' are at bottom governed and contaminated by this presupposition of external origin - this is more difficult to concede. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
 This, however, is something to reflect upon. It is not by chance that in response to the 'question of right', the classical theory of knowledge puts into play a category like that of the 'subject' (from the Cartesian <I>ego cogito</I> to the Kantian transcendental Subject to the 'concrete', transcendental subjects of Husserl). This category is simply a reproduction within the field of philosophy of the ideological notion of 'subject', itself taken from the juridical category of the 'legal subject'. And the 'subject-object' couple, the 'subject' and 'its' object, is merely a reflection within the philosophical field, and within a properly philosophical mode, of the juridical categories of the 'legal subject', 'owner' <I>of itself and</I> of its goods (things). So with consciousness: it is owner of itself (<I>self</I>-consciousness) and of its goods (consciousness <I>of its</I> object, of <I>its</I> objects). Critical idealist philosophy resolves this duality of right in a philosophical theory of <I>constitutive</I> (of itself and of its object) consciousness. Husserl explains this theory of constitutive consciousness as 'intentional' consciousness. Intentionality is the theory  <I>of</I> the '<I>of </I>' (consciousness <I>of</I> self-consciousness <I>of</I> its object). Only one 'of': just like that, consciousness is <I>sure</I> of grasping itself when it grasps <I>its</I> object, and vice versa. Always the same need for a <I>guarantee </I>! I have given only a simple indication here, but it could easily be shown, by developing its logic, and by supporting it with all the connecting elements, that the demonstration is possible. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
 If this is the case, we can understand why critical-rationalist idealist philosophy subjects the sciences and scientific practice to a preliminary question that already contains the answer which it innocently claims to be seeking in the sciences. And because this answer, inscribed in the question of right, appears in law only because it appears elsewhere at the same time: in the entire structure of emerging bourgeois society and therefore in its ideology, in the practico-aesthetico-religious 'values' of

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 129</B></FONT><P>

this ideology, we can understand that what is being played out, in an apparently exclusive manner, in the little 'theatre' of the Theory of knowledge, and of the epistemology of rationalist and critical philosophies, concerns very different debates: for Kant, the destiny of law, morality, religion and politics in the epoch of the French Revolution; for Husserl, 'the crisis of the European Sciences' [<I>sic </I>!]<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp129">10</A>]</FONT> under imperialism. Of course, the sciences exploited by idealism once again bore the cost of the operation. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The following points therefore emerge from this analysis: the vast majority of philosophies, be they religious, spiritualist or idealist, maintain a relation of <I>exploitation</I> with the sciences. Which means: the sciences are never seen for what they really are; their existence, their limits, their growing pains (baptized 'crises') or their mechanisms, as interpreted by the idealist categories of the most well-informed philosophies, are <I>used</I> from outside; they may be used crudely or subtly, but they are used to furnish arguments or guarantees for extra-scientific values that the philosophies in question objectively serve through their own practice, their 'questions' and their 'theories'. These 'values' pertain to <I>practical ideologies</I>, which play their own role in the social cohesion and social conflicts of class societies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Obviously, I am aware of the objection that cannot fail to come to mind, for scientists will readily agree with my remarks. What scientist has not felt the very particular impression created by philosophy in its relation to the sciences, even when it declares its sincerity and honesty: the impression of blackmail and exploitation? Philosophers obviously do not have this impression: exploiters in general, and not simply in philosophy, never have the impression of being exploiters. And that does not make for easy relations between philosophers and scientists. But - and here is the objection - if every philosophy is, as has been shown, subordinate to certain values pertaining to practical ideologies, and if there is an almost organic link between philosophies and practical ideologies, <I>in the name of what philosophy do we denounce this exploitation</I>? Is the philosophy to which we adhere by chance an exception? Is it exempt from this link? Is it exempt from this dependency, and the shortcomings it implies, and is it therefore, and <I>a priori</I>, immune to the possibility that it might exploit the sciences? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In all honesty, my answer must be that we cannot offer you an absolute <I>guarantee.</I> And I will add: if we were to offer you such a guarantee (after what has been said concerning the abusive, harmful and

illusory function of the search for a philosophical 'guarantee'), it would be, in our eyes at least, suspect. Instead, we will offer you two means of control. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   First, we offer the <I>practice</I> of our philosophy. The same scientists who are capable of 'feeling' from experience whether or not a given philosophy is treating the sciences in cavalier fashion, or abusing or exploiting the sciences, will be able to tell if we are <I>exploiting</I> the sciences or if, on the contrary, we <I>are serving</I> them in our philosophical practice. This is a <I>de facto</I> argument. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And here is a <I>de jure</I> argument. It is true that all the great philosophical currents we have briefly analysed are subordinated to the 'values' of the practical ideologies which exist in a conjuncture: to the values, let us say, of the dominant ideology (and, beneath it, the dominated ideologies). Let us go even further: it is highly probable that <I>every</I> philosophy, even if it is not religious, spiritualist or idealist, maintains an organic relation with the 'values' of some practical ideology, with the values in question in the ideological struggle (which takes place against the backdrop of the class struggle). Which implies that <I>materialist</I> philosophies, of which we have not spoken, obey the same law themselves. Even if they do not exploit the sciences to prove the existence of God or to shore up great moral and aesthetic values, even if they are devoted, as they most certainly are, to a materialist <I>defence</I> of the sciences, they are not without a relation to a <I>practical</I> ideology, usually <I>political</I> ideology even if, as in the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, it is highly contaminated with juridico-moral ideology. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We must go that far. But it is necessary to go a lot further. For if this dependence of philosophy on practical ideologies and their conflicts is recognized, why should philosophy <I>passively</I> submit to dependence on these realities (practical ideologies) without being able to produce a knowledge both of the nature and of the mechanism of these realities? Now it so happens that the principles of this knowledge were furnished by Marx in historical materialism, and that this knowledge transformed the old materialism into a new materialism: dialectical materialism.<FONT SIZE=-2>[11]</FONT> It has been seen that the philosophy to which we adhere - or, more exactly, the position we occupy in philosophy - is not unrelated to politics, to a certain politics, to Lenin's politics, so much so that Lenin's political formulae were of use to us in stating our theses on philosophy. There is no contradiction here: this politics is the politics of the workers'

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
11.&nbsp;This knowledge did not, as is all too often said, transform philosophy into a <I>science </I>: the new philosophy is still <I>philosophy</I>, but <I>scientific</I> knowledge of its relations with practical ideologies makes it a 'correct' philosophy.

movement and its theory comes from Marx, <I>just as the knowledge of practical ideologies that finally permits philosophy to control and criticize its organic link with practical ideology</I>, <I>and therefore to rectify the effects of this link by taking a 'correct' line</I>, <I>comes from Marx.</I> In the absence of an absolute guarantee (something that does not exist except in idealist philosophy, and we know what to think of that), here are the arguments that we can present. They are both practical (they can be judged by comparing the services which we can render the sciences) and theoretical (the critical check on the inevitable effects of ideology on philosophy through a knowledge of the mechanisms of ideology and ideological struggle: in particular, by a knowledge of their action on philosophy).

<P>
We may now take up this second point. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The meaning of the manufacture of 'new' or 'true' philosophies of science' by scientists in the grip of a scientific 'crisis' will now perhaps be more readily understood. In so far as they simply adopt spiritualist or idealist themes that have been 'worked upon' for centuries in the history of philosophy, they too take their place, <I>even though they are scientists</I>, in the long tradition of those who exploit the sciences for apologetic ends, and naturally without the counterweight of materialism and without the critical checks that can be ensured, within materialism, by knowledge of the mechanism of ideology and the class conflicts within it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But at the same time we can also understand something else: what we have described as the reaction of those stubborn and silent hard-working scientists who, even in the midst of the pseudo-crisis, obstinately pursue their work and defend it with arguments, always the same arguments, that the great philosophers of the 'crisis' call naive and materialist. We have spoken very little of this type of scientist (the first reaction). However, Lenin, who violently attacked other scientists, defended them by evoking their 'materialist instinct'. These scientists never proclaimed that 'matter' had disappeared: they thought that it continued to exist and that physical science does indeed produce a knowledge of the 'laws of matter'. These scientists have no need of a neo-critical philosophy to revitalize their idea of science and of the 'conditions of possibility' of scientific knowledge; they have no need of a philosophy to <I>guarantee</I> that their knowledges are truly knowledges - that is, <I>objective</I> (in a double sense: knowledge of its object and knowledge valid outside of any subjectivity). They defend themselves as best they can. Their arguments may seem 'simple' or even 'crude' to their adversaries; they 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 132</B></FONT><P>

may even be mistaken in their idea as to how to resolve the contradictions of modern physics: but who is <I>guaranteed</I> not to err? They represent a very different position to that of their peers, who are in the 'grip' of the philosophy they profess. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Their existence is important for us. For if we want to speak of the spontaneous philosophy of scientists in all its breadth and its contradiction, we must take into account both extremes: not only the scientists who construct a philosophy that exploits the difficulties of science, but also those scientists who obstinately fight, at considerable personal risk, on the basis of very different positions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I will cut short these indispensable analyses in order to justify the details of the exposition and get down to basics.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;By looking at the elements furnished by the experience of a 'crisis' in a science, we have come to the conclusion that there exists a relation between philosophy and the sciences, and that this first relation may be revealed in the work of scientists themselves in so far as they are bearers of what I have termed a spontaneous philosophy of scientists (SPS).

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;We understand this term (SPS) in a very strict and limited sense. By SPS we understand not the set of ideas that scientists have about the world (i.e., their 'world-view') but only the ideas that they have (consciously or unconsciously) concerning their scientific practice and science.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  3.&nbsp;We therefore rigorously distinguish between (1) the spontaneous philosophy of scientists and (2) scientists' world-views. These two realities are united by profound ties, but they can and must be distinguished. Later, we will examine the notion of world-view. The SPS bears only on the ideas (conscious or unconscious) that scientists have of the scientific practice of the sciences and of 'Science'.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  4.&nbsp;If the content of the SPS is analysed, the following fact may be registered (we are still at the level of empirical analysis): the content of the SPS is <I>contradictory.</I> The contradiction exists between two <I>elements</I> that may be distinguished and identified in the following manner:

ter. They can be broken down as follows: (1) belief in the real,<BR>
external and material existence of the <I>object</I> of the<BR> scientific knowledge;
(2) belief in the existence and<BR> objectivity of the <I>scientific knowledges</I>
that permit<BR> knowledge of this object; (3) belief in the correctness and<BR>
efficacy of the procedures of scientific experimentation, or<BR> <I>scientific
method</I>, capable of producing scientific<BR> knowledge. What characterizes the corpus of these<BR>convictions-Theses is that they allow no room
for the<BR> philosophical 'doubt' that calls into question the validity of<BR>
scientific practice; that they avoid what we have called the<BR> 'question
of right', the question of the right to existence of<BR> the object of knowledge, of knowledge of that object, and of<BR> scientific method.<P>

B.&nbsp;An element of external, 'extra-scientific' origin which we shall call<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
ELEMENT 2.</FONT>&nbsp;In its most diffuse form, this element too<BR> represents a
certain number of 'convictions' or 'beliefs' that<BR> can be elaborated in
philosophical Theses. It is, of course,<BR> <I>related</I> to scientific practice
itself, but does not originate<BR> in it. On the contrary, it is a reflection <I>on</I>
scientific<BR> practice by means of philosophical Theses elaborated<BR>
<I>outside</I> this practice by the religious, spiritualist or<BR> idealist-critical
'philosophies of science' manufactured by<BR> philosophers or scientists.
It is characteristic of the<BR> 'convictions-Theses' of Element 2 that they
should<BR> subordinate the experience of scientific practice to Theses,<BR>
and therefore to 'values' or 'instances', that are external to it<BR> and
which, by exploiting the sciences, uncritically serve a<BR> certain number
of objectives pertaining to practical<BR> ideologies. In appearance, they
are as 'spontaneous' as the<BR> first set: in fact, they are highly elaborated
and can be<BR> considered 'spontaneous' only because their dominance
makes<BR> them immediately 'obvious'. To speak only of this case, in the<BR>
nuance of their formulation they bear the trace of the<BR> 'question of
right', which can take many forms: a calling into<BR> question of the
external material existence of the <I>object</I><BR> (replaced by <I>experience</I> or
<I>experiment</I>); a calling into<BR> question of the objectivity of scientific
knowledges and of<BR> theory (replaced by '<I>models </I>'); a calling into
question of<BR> scientific method (replaced by 'techniques of validation');
or<BR> an emphasis on the 'value of science', the 'scientific spirit',<BR> its
exemplary 'critical virtue', etc.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<BR>
Having identified what is at stake in the conflict between scientists caught up in a pseudo-crisis of science (and it is manifestly <I>materialism </I>), we can reasonably call Element 1 the <I>materialist</I> element and Element 2 the <I>idealist</I> element (in the generic sense of the three philosophies - religious, spiritualist and critical - that we have rapidly examined).

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 134</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  5.&nbsp;In the spontaneous philosophy of scientists (SPS) the (materialist) Element 1 is, in the vast majority of cases, dominated by Element 2 (and the exceptions are therefore all the more noteworthy). This situation reproduces in the heart of the SPS the philosophical balance of power that exists between materialism and idealism in the world in which scientists known to us live, and the domination of idealism over materialism.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp134">12</A>]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Nothing is less 'obvious' than this last fact. And even if scientists are fairly knowledgeable about the nature of philosophy, about the internal conflicts played out within it, and the way in which they are related to the great political and ideological struggles of this world, were they to recognize that in social, political, ideological, moral, etc. terms, materialism is in fact massively dominated by idealism (which reproduces on the theoretical plane the domination of the exploited classes by the exploiting classes), they would be reluctant to admit that the same balance of power exists <I>within</I> their own SPS. And so we must try to demonstrate it to them. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It would take an extended theoretical and historical analysis to do so properly. Here again, however, given the lack of time, we must restrict ourselves to the production of simple <I>empirical</I> facts to make this decisive reality 'visible'. But even assuming that we can make it visible, I should not conceal the difficulty of the task: it is difficult because we must 'work' here in the element of 'spontaneity' - that is, in the forms of 'representation' that are given in an immediate obviousness which it will be necessary to break through or get around. And nothing is more difficult to break through or get around than the obvious. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Consider, for example, what happens between you, who are scientists, and me, a philosopher. When a philosopher speaks, as I am doing, of Element 1 of the SPS by calling it 'intra-scientific', he will easily be understood, for the majority of scientists do not <I>doubt</I> the existence of their object, the objectivity of their findings (knowledges), or the efficacy of their method. But if he calls Element 1 <I>materialist</I>, he will not be understood by all scientists. Some will understand: modern specialists in the earth sciences, naturalists, zoologists, biologists, physiologists, etc. For <I>all</I> these scientists, the words 'matter', 'materialism', and the adjective 'materialist' express something essential about their convictions as to their scientific practice: for them these words are 'correct'. But if we turn to other disciplines, things change considerably.

whether their 'object' 'exists') and, with some exceptions, specialists in the human sciences (the majority of whom would not admit to being materialists), let us consider two sciences that do in fact deal with <I>matter </I>: physics and chemistry. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  When it comes to talking about themselves, physicists and chemists are very modest and reserved. I will therefore attempt to speak on their behalf: and they will tell me later whether I was correct or not. And if we were now to tell physicists and chemists that they have a spontaneous philosophy of scientists, which is contradictory and contains both an 'intra-scientific' element and an 'extra-scientific' element - the one originating in their practice, the other imported from the outside - they would not deny it. They would not find that improbable. But when they are told that Element 1 (intra-scientific) is of a <I>materialist</I> character, and especially when it is explained that this element has as its kernel the unity of three terms - an external object with a material existence/ objective scientific knowledges or theories/scientific method, or, more schematically, object/theory/method - they have the impression of hearing not a scandalous language but a language that sounds foreign to them, that has nothing to do with the content of their own 'experience'. This means that, to them, things are <I>spontaneously</I> presented in other terms. And if they were asked to speak for themselves, the odds are that they would replace the little group <I>object/theory/method</I> with another, much more 'modern' little group, in which it would be a question of 'experimental data', of 'models', and of 'techniques of validation' - or, more schematically, <I>experiment/models/techniques.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This does not seem like much: after all, words are just words. If we wish to change them, we have only to establish the right convention. But unfortunately, we are not free to establish our own conventions in these matters, nor are words substituted for one another without a reason. To take only one little word, perfectly innocent in appearance: <I>experience</I> (or '<I>experiential</I> data'). It has to be made known that this word has <I>expelled</I> another word from the place which it occupies in the second group: <I>a materially existing external object.</I> It is for this purpose that Kant put it in power against materialism and that it was returned to power by the empirio-critical philosophy of which we have spoken. When experience (which is, note well, something very different from experimentation) is promoted to the highest position, and when one speaks of <I>models</I> instead of <I>theory</I>, we are not simply changing two words: a slippage of meaning is provoked, or better, one meaning is <I>obscured</I> by another, and the first, materialist, meaning disappears under the second, idealist, meaning. It is in this equivocation, imperceptible to most physicists and chemists, that the domination of Element 2 over Element 1 is achieved in their SPS - which proves that it is not 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 136</B></FONT><P>

enough for a science to work with 'matter' for its practitioners to recognize themselves as materialists. Which also proves, in fact, that a strange dialectic is in play between the two elements of the SPS: since one of these elements can obscure the other to the extent of making it disappear entirely, whilst claiming that it is merely 'giving an account' of the <I>same practice.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  However that may be, and to restrict discussion to the domination provoked by this slippage of meaning: it has not always existed in the history of physics and chemistry or any of the 'experimental' sciences that think their practice in terms of 'experiment/model/technique'. A hundred years ago, physicists and chemists employed a very different language to speak of their practice, a language close to that used today by earth scientists and life scientists. If our scientific friends took the time to study the history of their discipline and of their own predecessors' representation of it, they would find interesting documents proving how, and under what influences, this slippage in the terminology of their SPS occurred, resulting in the domination of the extra-scientific Element 2 over the intra-scientific Element 1. It may be concluded from this that to understand the content of an SPS, it is indispensable to return to the history of the sciences and to the history of the spontaneous philosophies, which simultaneously depend upon the history of the sciences and on the history of philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But let us attempt once again to make 'palpable' the fact of this domination by means of another, 'inverse' example. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If we recognize the existence of these two contradictory elements in the SPS and the dominance of Element 2 over Element 1, and if we know that Element 2 is organically linked to the philosophies which exploit the sciences to apologetic ends, for the benefit of the 'values' of practical ideologies that are neither known nor criticized, it is clear that <I>it is in the interests of scientists to transform their SPS in a critical manner</I>, to dispel the illusions contained in Element 2, and to change the existing balance of power so as to place the 'intra-scientific' and materialist Element 1 in a position of dominance. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But if it is obviously in their interests to do so, it is also obvious from experience that it is <I>practically impossible</I> (except perhaps in borderline cases, which would have to be studied separately) for the internal play of the SPS alone to bring about a shift in the balance of power within that SPS or a critical transformation of that SPS. To put it another way: in the (most general) situation in which Element 2 dominates Element 1, it is impossible to reverse the balance of power <I>without external support.</I> The domination of Element 1 by Element 2 cannot be overturned simply through an internal <I>critical</I> confrontation. As a general rule, the SPS is incapable of criticizing itself through the play of its internal content alone.

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 137</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What might this external support be? This external force capable of changing the balance of power within the SPS? First, it can only be a force of the same nature as the forces that are in contention: a <I>philosophical</I> force. But not just any philosophical force: a force capable of criticizing and dispelling the idealist illusions of Element 2 by basing itself on Element 1; therefore a philosophical force related to the philosophical force of Element 1 - that is, a <I>materialist</I> philosophical force which, instead of exploiting, respects and serves scientific practice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Scientists are perfectly well aware that this is a matter of philosophy, of the philosophical balance of power, and therefore, in the last instance, of philosophical struggle. If they know something of their past, they know perfectly well, for example, that the experimental sciences of the eighteenth century received considerable help from materialist philosophers. And under the umbrella of the Great and Glorious History of the Enlightenment they know the stakes of the struggle <I>in</I> the representations which the men of this time (priests and their intellectuals on one side, the materialist Encyclopaedists on the other) formed of the sciences and of scientific practice: it was a matter of freeing 'minds' from a false representation of science and knowledge, and of bringing about the triumph over it of a 'correct' or more 'correct' representation. It was a matter of struggling to transform the existing SPS: and in this struggle to change the balance of power, <I>the scientists needed philosophers</I> and relied upon them. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Of course things do not always happen in broad daylight. But just as our 'crisis in science' revealed to us the philosopher dormant in every scientist, so the open alliance of the scientists and <I>philosophes</I> of the Enlightenment, under the slogan of 'materialism', shows us <I>the condition</I> without which the balance of power between Element 2 and Element 1 within the SPS cannot be shifted. This condition is <I>the alliance of scientists with materialist philosophy</I>, which brings to scientists the extra forces needed so to reinforce the materialist element as to dispel the religious-idealist illusions that dominated their SPS. The circumstances were no doubt 'exceptional', but there again they have the advantage of showing us in 'bold print' what, in the 'normal' course of things, is 'writ small' in tiny or illegible letters. And since we are speaking of this Grand Alliance between materialist philosophy and the scientists of the eighteenth century, why not recall that slogan under which this alliance was sealed - <I>materialism</I> - was brought to the scientists by philosophers who wanted to serve them and who on the whole, despite the shortcomings of this materialism (mechanism, etc.), served them well? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But at the same time - to dwell on this example for a moment - it is also necessary to take stock of the objective limits of this alliance. For the 'materialism' that thus came to the aid of the sciences and scientists 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 138</B></FONT><P>

protected them, above all, from <I>religious</I> power and imposture. The 'historical line of demarcation' of this time was a line between a 'religious knowledge' that was no more than dogma and 'obscurantism', and sought to govern all the world's knowledge, and a scientific knowledge that was open and 'free' in the face of the infinite which it discovered in the mechanism of things. But this materialism was itself subject to the domination of another idealism because of its own representation of the 'Truth': a juridical, moral and political idealism. It is not by chance that the materialism of the eighteenth century was also the materialism of the 'Century of the <I>Enlightenment </I>'. In the great symbol of Enlightenment, which the German language renders more explicitly as <I>Aufkl&auml;rung</I>, enlightenment, <I>illumination</I> (very different from the mysticism of 'illuminism'), the scientists and philosophers of this time themselves were also living a Great Illusion: that of the historical omnipotence of knowledge. An old tradition, stretching back centuries and linked no doubt to the power attributed, in the division of labour, to those who possessed 'knowledge' (but there is no 'power of knowledge' that is not bound up with 'power' proper): exalting the omnipotence of Knowledge over Ignorance. Truth has only to appear for all shadows, errors and prejudices to vanish, just as the break of day drives away the shades of night. This 'thought' has never ceased to haunt even modern scientists. In some corner of their mind they are certain that because they possess science and the experience of its practice, they possess exceptional truths: quite apart from the Truth, which they do not doubt will one day be recognized and transform the world, they possess the 'virtues' of its acquisition - honesty, rigour, purity and disinterestedness, which they are quite ready to fashion into an Ethics. And they think that all this derives from their practice itself! And why should they not think so, given that in their practice they are honest and rigorous and pure and disinterested? These 'obviousnesses' are the most difficult to overcome. For, to return to our detour through the eighteenth century, we may see 'as clearly as day', so to speak, that the conviction that scientific truth is omnipotent is closely bound up with something other than the sciences themselves: with the juridical, moral and political 'consciousness' of the <I>intellectuals</I> of a rising class which is confident that it can take power thanks to the obviousness of Truth and Reason, and which has already put Truth in power. In their Enlightenment philosophy, the scientists and <I>philosophes</I> of the eighteenth century, however materialist they may have been in their struggle against religion, were no less <I>idealist</I> in their conception of history. And their idealist conception of the omnipotence of scientific truth derives, in the last instance, from their historical (juridical, moral, political) idealism. Those (such as Monod) who even today take up in other forms the same

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 139</B></FONT><P>

exemplary themes and are, as their predecessors once were, convinced that they are speaking <I>solely</I> of their own experience as scientists, are in fact speaking of something very different: of what is now, for understandable reasons, a bitter and disillusioned philosophy of history. They simply reflect it in connection with their scientific experience, and it is reflected <I>in</I> their experience. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Why all these details? To come to the following conclusion: in the contradictory history of the materialism of the Enlightenment, we may see the <I>conditions</I> of a shift in the balance of power between Element 1 and Element 2 and the <I>limits</I> of that shift. The <I>conditions </I>: the materialism of the <I>philosophes</I> incontestably served the scientific practice of the times, by reinforcing Element 1 against the religious impostures of Element 2 that then dominated Element 1. The scientists' Alliance with materialism served the sciences. The <I>limits </I>: but at the same time, whilst it did modify the prior balance of power, the contradiction of the Enlightenment philosophers' materialism (they were idealists in history) in fact restored the former balance of power: by subordinating Element 1, the materialist element, to <I>a new Element 2</I>, to an idealist element. Yes, to a new Element 2 which, thanks to the illusion of the omnipotence of Truth, and therefore of scientific knowledge, could incorporate all the themes of the ruling empiricism of the day. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If this analysis, which is barely an analysis at all, has any indicative value, it is that it verifies, this time in an inverted and (which is even more interesting) a contradictory way, our Thesis on the domination of Element 2 over Element 1 and on the inability of an SPS to modify its internal balance of power, to criticize itself. For it goes without saying that the illusions of the <I>philosophes</I> and scientists of the Enlightenment have taken a beating from history. It was not their ideas that changed the world by 'reforming the understanding', by bringing 'Reason' to light, by bringing Truth to power; it was the 'unenlightened' popular peasant and plebeian masses when they rose up in rags during the Revolution. Just as it is not their 'enlightened' representations of scientific practice that has always allowed the sciences to advance, but rather the thankless labour of certain practitioners who do make progress - sometimes because of these ideas, but often in spite of them: because of <I>other</I> ideas. The ruse of 'Reason'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If you are willing to bear with me, we will draw some conclusions from this episode. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I hope, first of all, to have made it clear that the balance of power within an SPS cannot be changed through an immanent critique: there must be a counterforce, and that counterforce can only be philosophical and materialist.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 140</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Further, I hope to have made it clear that neither the contradictory relation between the elements of the SPS, nor the materialist philosophy that may intervene in their conflict, is given from all eternity, and that they belong to a definite historical conjuncture. Coming into play are not only the state of the sciences, the scientific division of labour, relations between different sciences, and possibly the domination of one science over the others, imposing its own practice as the norm of scientific practice, etc., but also the state of the dominant SPS and the state of the existing philosophies, practical ideologies and class conflicts. If this <I>historical</I> reality, and its necessarily contradictory forms, are neglected, it is impossible to understand anything at all about the SPS and the conditions of its transformation. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Finally, I hope to have shown that the materialist philosophy which can so strengthen the forces of Element 1 as to transform in a critical manner the forces of Element 2 must be <I>other</I> than the materialist philosophy that allied itself with the scientists of the eighteenth century against the Church and religious philosophy and ideology. For this latter philosophy, materialist in one sense, was idealist in another, and the services it rendered the sciences on the one hand were paid for on the other by a restoration, <I>in a new form</I>, of the prior domination of idealism (Element 1) over materialism (Element 2). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If this is so, we may perhaps be able to define the <I>conditions</I> for new Alliance between scientists and a materialist philosophy that respects and serves scientific practice.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;They cannot be <I>general</I> conditions (edifying statements such as: scientists need philosophy), but must be <I>specific</I> conditions which above all take into account the <I>historical</I> balance of power. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is not enough to recognize the existence within the SPS of two elements, and the contradiction between them; nor even to identify one as materialist and the other as idealist; nor, finally, to establish that as a general rule the second dominates the first. In every case we have to know the <I>actual historical form</I> of these two elements and their contradiction. For it is an observable fact that the form of the representation of scientific practice, the form of its contradiction, <I>varies</I> in history with the history of the sciences and the history of philosophy and, behind these two 'histories', with the history of political and ideological struggles that are ultimately reflected in these two elements. We therefore have to identify the actual historical form of the antagonism in the <I>dominant</I> SPS. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I say dominant, for it is also a fact of experience (we encountered it when examining the position of scientists belonging to different branches of scientific knowledge) that there is no such thing as a single, unique

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 141</B></FONT><P>

form of the SPS in a determinate epoch; there are <I>several</I>, one of which is in a dominant position, while the others, which have enjoyed their moment of power, must submit, although continuing to exist in a subordinate position. Thus, the mechanistic rationalism dominant in the seventeenth century, the empiricist rationalism dominant in the eighteenth century, and then the positivism dominant in the nineteenth century (if I may be for given these very schematic indications), although dominated today by the logical, neo-positivist SPS, subsist and survive even in our conjuncture - and one 'opportunity' is enough for them to return, in certain disciplines, to centre-stage (thus, Cartesian mechanistic rationalism serves the SPS well in Chomsky's linguistics or in avant-garde biology).
  It will be understood that this enumeration does not in the least indicate a linear sequence. On the contrary, it is the trace of a <I>conflict-ridden</I> history in which different forms of the SPS clashed in protracted and harsh struggles: let us say, 'ways of thinking' scientific practice, 'manners of posing scientific problems' ('problematics'), and finally 'modes of resolving' the theoretical contradictions of the history of the sciences. It is because this history is <I>conflict-ridden</I> that it is necessarily resolved by <I>putting into power</I> a new 'form of thought' or a new SPS which, at a certain moment, begins to supplant those that preceded it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But if we must speak of a conflict-ridden history of the SPS, then <I>every</I> conjuncture (including our own) must be considered conflict-ridden. And because in philosophy a conflict is never definitively or absolutely settled, in order to see this conflict clearly it is not only necessary to recognize the forces present: it is also necessary to identify the <I>tendential</I> resolution of this conflict, to know where it has come from in order to know where it is going, to which 'taking of power' it will lead. We must therefore take into consideration all the 'stratified' forms of the SPS which subsist and intervene, directly or indirectly, in the conflict and the forms that occupy centre-stage, and we must discern which is really the ascendant force and through what contradictory process it 'clears a path' to achieve domination. We shall see later what today's ascendant SPS is: logical neo-positivism.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;The conditions of an Alliance between scientists and a new materialist philosophy must be particularly clear. I repeat that we are talking about an Alliance through which materialist philosophy brings its support to Element 1 of the SPS to help it struggle against Element 2 of the SPS: to alter the balance of power, currently dominated by the idealism of Element 2, in favour of Element 1. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Through this Alliance, materialist philosophy is authorized to intervene in the SPS and <I>only in the SPS.</I> Which means that philosophy 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 142</B></FONT><P>

intervenes only in philosophy. It refrains from making any intervention in science proper, in its problems, in its practice. This does not imply that there is a radical separation between science, on the one hand, and philosophy, on the other; or that science is a domain reserved for science alone. Rather, it means that the role of philosophical categories and even philosophical conceptions in science, a role of which we have not hitherto spoken,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp142">13</A>]</FONT> is exercised, among other forms, through the intermediary of the SPS, and that the philosophical intervention of which we speak here is an intervention by philosophy in philosophy. Again, it is a question of shifting the balance of power within the SPS, in such a way that scientific practice is no longer <I>exploited</I> by philosophy, but <I>served</I> by it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Now you will understand why we insist on the <I>novel</I> character of the materialist philosophy from which scientific practice may expect this service. For if it is to be able to serve scientific practice, this materialist philosophy must be prepared to combat all the forms of the idealist exploitation of the sciences; and if it is to be able to wage this combat <I>en connaissance de cause</I>, this philosophy must be capable of <I>mastering through knowledge and criticism</I> the organic link that binds it to the practical ideologies on which it, like any other philosophy, depends. We have seen under what conditions this critical control is possible: <I>only</I> in the case of a materialist philosophy connected to the discoveries through which Marx opened up the way to knowledge of the mechanisms of 'ideological social relations' (Lenin), and therefore a knowledge of the function of practical ideologies and their class antagonisms. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But if this is the case, it will also be understood <I>that it is not a question of simply 'applicating' a ready-made philosophy to a determinate SPS.</I> For even supposing that we are applying a ready-made philosophy, a philosophy that has been perfectly elaborated and has mastered all its categories, we ought not to expect a miracle. A balance of power is not reversed in an instant, and idealist illusions are not simply swept away. If we believed that, we would simply be reproducing, within a formally materialist philosophy, the essentials of the idealist conception of the Enlightenment: the omnipotence of the Truth dissipating the shadows of error. We might well have a materialist philosophy; but this would not be a <I>materialist practice</I> of that materialist philosophy. It would mean forgetting that this affair is a matter of <I>struggle.</I> The Alliance we propose cannot be reduced to a protocol agreement. Of course we should sign it and proclaim it. But thereafter everything remains to be

<A NAME="fnp142">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
13.&nbsp;One may legitimately defend the idea that, when they are 'correct', philosophical categories function as <I>relations of production</I> and <I>reproduction</I> of scientific knowledge.

</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 143</B></FONT><P>

done: the protracted and arduous labour, amounting to a battle, to win terrain from the enemy, to foil his tricks and foresee his counterattacks, the long and arduous struggle to confront the unforeseeable forms that emerge from the development of scientific practice itself, and of which the enemy will always know how to take advantage. When allies agree to unite their forces, they must realize that they are engaged in a common struggle which is at the same time an interminable struggle. And the struggle is all the more difficult in that we still live in a situation in which idealism is dominant within the consciousness of intellectuals and will be so for a long time to come, even after the Revolution. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Throughout our argument we have assumed that materialist philosophy is complete, and armed with well-prepared arguments. But <I>this is not the case.</I> The scientists to whom we have proposed this Alliance must know the nature of the materialist philosophy with which they are allying themselves. If philosophy is a struggle, and if, in this struggle, it is idealist philosophy that is dominant, this inevitably means that <I>dialectical materialist philosophy must itself be constituted in the struggle</I>, and that in the course of this struggle it must gradually win its own positions against the enemy simply in order to exist, to acquire the existence of a historical force. Just as materialist philosophy does not possess the 'truth' about the sciences, so it does not claim to present itself as a completed truth. Of course, we are able to state a certain number of basic Theses that begin to constitute a corpus of categories; and these Theses are tested in the struggle against idealist Theses. But they do not constitute a 'system' as in the idealist philosophies: the system of a total and closed Truth. If dialectical materialist philosophy is genuinely a weapon in theory it must, on the basis of a minimum number of firm principles that assure its position, be mobile enough to take itself where battle calls and to be formed - that is, constituted - in the battle itself. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Have scientists ever been offered such an Alliance? It is truly unique: because it respects the sciences in their domain; because it calls on philosophy's help only to intervene in the philosophy that exploits the sciences; because, instead of promising a miracle, it calls for a struggle conducted <I>en connaissance de cause</I>, and a struggle without end; because, rather than speaking of the intervention of a completed, finished philosophy, it warns that philosophy is constituted in its intervention. Have you ever heard of a philosophy so modest in the way it offers its services? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  And so we call upon you to join this Alliance. We do not expect miracles from it, and we are not promising you the earth, for we know the world we live in, a world where all the important things, even those which concern the spontaneous philosophy of scientists, are not decided in the minds of intellectuals but in the class struggle and its effects. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 144</B></FONT><P>

However, we may expect results from this Alliance: both for the scientists that you are and for the philosophers we are. By inviting you to draw a 'line of demarcation' in your SPS between Element 1 and Element 2, we are not acting as spectators or judges giving advice. By inviting you to form an Alliance with dialectical materialist philosophy, we are not acting like 'elders' who have the strength you need. For <I>we apply the same rule to ourselves that we recommend to you.</I> How? By 'drawing' our own 'line of demarcation' <I>in philosophy </I>; by occupying, within philosophy, positions that enable us to combat idealism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If you have followed us this far, it seems likely that you have been convinced that such is indeed our practice. From the very beginning we have been able to speak of philosophy only by occupying a definite position in philosophy. For in philosophy we cannot, like Rousseau's Noble Savage in the <I>Discours sur l'origine et les fondements de l'inegalite parmi les hommes</I>, occupy an <I>empty</I> corner of the forest. In philosophy every space is always already occupied. Within it, we can only hold a position against the adversary who already holds that position. This is not an easy task. It is a matter of 'words'; we know that. And nothing could be more natural than hearing words. But these words are not arbitrary and, above all, they must 'hold together'; otherwise, they will flee in every direction and have no position or space of their own to hold. And that is what has happened here among us. At times you perhaps had the impression that we were delivering a speech prepared in advance. Pedagogically (didactically), perhaps: but philosophically, no. In truth, what we have succeeded in saying to you was won through a protracted, sustained effort: a work of reflection that was at the same time a struggle. And if we have set you an example, so be it: it is your turn now.

<P>
Monod's text is an exceptional document, of an unparalleled scientific quality and intellectual honesty. I speak of it with the greatest respect, and I hope to give proof of that throughout my analysis. It will be seen that I do not accord myself any right to intervene in its strictly scientific content, which I accept unreservedly as an absolute reference for any philosophical reflection. At the same time, it will be seen that I not only accord myself the right, but also the duty, even <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> Monod, to make a clear distinction between its strictly scientific content and the philosophical use of which it is the object - not on the part of philosophers external to Monod but on the part of Monod himself, in Element 2 of his SPS, in his philosophy and his world-view (WV). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I will discuss Monod's SPS, his philosophy and his WV in the most <I>objective manner</I> possible. In speaking of Monod and citing his declarations, I am not attacking Monod himself but the '<I>realities </I>' which appear in his own 'consciousness' as so many realities which appear in the 'consciousness' of all scientists, and therefore as so many objective realities independent of the subjective personality of the scientists.

1.&nbsp;The themes of Jacques Monod's lecture were subsequently developed in a book of the same title; see <I>Chance and Necessity - An Essay on the Natural Philosophy of Modern Biology</I> (1970), London 1972. [Ed.]

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 146</B></FONT><P>

Through the analysis of Monod's text, I want to bring out objective '<I>general realities </I>', the form of which varies according to the individuals, their disciplines, and the historical moment of their science, which dominate and govern the 'consciousness' of all scientists, usually without their knowing it. I speak of scientists in the strict sense; however, you will already have realized that what I say about them is infinitely more true of specialists in the human sciences and also, although with specific differences, of mere philosophers. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  One last word concerning the particular form which those general elements take in Monod. As we shall see, they culminate in an idealist world-view that I do not share. But Monod's world-view represents an idealistic tendency whose <I>form</I> is quite particular: in terms of its <I>scientific content</I>, it may be considered <I>the richest form of idealism</I> to be found in this idealist tendency. I also see - another very important sign - an indication of this in the fact that the morality which dominates Monod's world-view is what he calls an ethics of knowledge - that is, an ethics closely linked to <I>scientifc practice.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Because of its scientific richness, its honesty and its nobility, Monod's text is in our opinion an exceptional text, to which I would like to pay public homage. This is only a philosopher's homage. I would be happy if it were taken for what it is - the homage of a philosopher, but a homage nevertheless. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For the clarity of the exposition, I will distinguish four elements in Monod's lecture:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#A1">1</A>.&nbsp;modern biological science;

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#A2">2</A>.&nbsp;the spontaneous philosophy of the scientist (SPS);

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="A1">
<B>
1.&nbsp;Modern Biological Science
</B>

<P>
It is present in the explanation Monod gives of his most recent findings and fundamental principles (beginning of paragraph 2, paragraphs 4, 5,

This exposition may be articulated in three 'moments', as follows:

  (a)&nbsp;The statement of the content of the '<I>discovery </I>' which has transformed modern biology: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), 'the consti-

tuent of chromosomes, the guardian of heredity, and the source of evolution, the philosopher's stone of biology'.

  (b)&nbsp;The reflection of this revolutionary scientific discovery in <I>the concepts of biological theory </I>: the concepts of <I>emergence</I> and of <I>teleonomy.</I> New key concepts of modern biological theory.

  (c)&nbsp;Retrospectively: these new concepts show that the old concepts of classical theory (evolution, finality) have been preserved but transcended in a new form. In a parallel way, the old philosophical theories linked to biological concepts (vitalism, mechanism) and the philosophies exploiting the results or the difficulties of biology (religious philosophy, metaphysics) appear to have been transcended but rejected (paragraphs 2 and 3): transcended but not preserved: rejected without appeal.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
<A NAME="A2">
<B>
2.&nbsp;The Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientist (Biologist) (SPS)
</B>

<P>
It is present throughout the exposition of the findings of modern biology, of its reflection in biological theory, and of its retrospective effects. We may distinguish the presence of two elements: <I>Element 1</I>, intra-scientific, materialist; <I>Element 2</I>, extra-scientific, idealist.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
<I>Element 1 (of the SPS)</I>

<P>
Basically <I>materialist</I>, basically dialectical.</I> As a general rule, Element 1 is almost always, if not invariably, 'intricated' in the exposition of scientific findings and therefore mixed in the scientific material itself: it is not isolated, and the scientist does not make it the object of his thought. It is up to us to '<I>disintricate </I>' it, thus to make it appear in its distinction by drawing a philosophical line of demarcation. Element 1 appears, then, on the occasion of the exposition, and of the reasons adduced for it, as a <I>tendency</I> confronted by, and opposed to, other tendencies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This fact is very striking in Monod's text, which is exemplary in this respect. Monod does not <I>declare</I> himself to be a materialist or a dialectical thinker. These words do not appear in his text. But everything he says about modern biology displays a profound materialist and dialectical tendency, visible in positive assertions coupled with determinate philosophical condemnations.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 148</B></FONT><P>

(a)&nbsp;M<FONT SIZE=-1>ATERIALISM</FONT>


<BR>
Sensitive points: 

<BR>
- Definition of the <I>material reality</I> of the object of biology via a critique of the notion (scientifically outmoded and 'functioning' only in certain philosophies) of 'living matter'. This one-word denunciation is a denunciation of philosophical exploitation, and therefore of an anti-scientific tendency: very precisely, it is the denunciation of the <I>vitalist philosophy</I> which is implied in the notion of 'living matter'. The expression 'living matter' is meaningless. '<I>There are living systems. There is no living matter.'</I> It is a denunciation of the use of the ambiguous notion of 'living matter' by certain physicists themselves, and of the exploitation of this notion by metaphysics and religious philosophy (an attack on Teilhard). 

<BR>
- The rejection of the notion of 'living matter' does not in any sense take Monod back to spiritualism or idealism: <I>he remains a materialist.</I> Living systems have 'emerged' in the material world ('local emergence of complex structures' endowed with specific qualities). This emergence is thought in terms of an openly materialist tendency: this emergence possesses a '<I>physical</I> support', DNA.

<P>
It will be noted that Monod's materialist theses are presented in a manner which is both positive and polemical: he rejects the philosophical elements (exploitative) to 'clear the way' for the exposition of scientific findings. This operation is, in itself and because of its results, of a <I>materialist</I> tendency.

<P>
(b)&nbsp;D<FONT SIZE=-1>IALECTICS</FONT>

<BR>
Sensitive points:

<BR>
- The critique of the ideological relation (philosophical exploitation) previously prevailing between emergence and 'teleonomy' (formerly known as teleology, finalism). Monod rejects all theories that subordinate emergence (the sudden appearance of life) to teleonomy. Thus he rejects in the clearest manner the spiritual-religious tendency which takes the view that if life appeared in the material world, it did so '<I>in order to </I>' realize a providential or natural end, to produce '<I>Spirit </I>'. Here again he is attacking Teilhard and all religious-spiritualist-idealist exploitation of biology.

<BR>
- As before, this critique 'opens the way' to positive categories: especially to the category of <I>emergence. In fact</I>, the category of emergence functions in Monod not only as a purely scientific category but also as a category representing a possible theory of a <I>dialectic</I> which is at work in nature itself. A very important category: in effect Monod

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 149</B></FONT><P>

proposes in the concept of emergence a 'rational kernel'<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp149">2</A>]</FONT> of a purely <I>intra-scientific</I> origin, which is, because of its theoretical potential and the tendency of this potential, full of dialectical resonance. In practical terms, and provided that we take it seriously, it allows us to think through what a certain philosophical tendency is looking for in connection with what has been called the 'laws of the dialectic', and even the dialectics of nature. Traditionally, one speaks of the 'qualitative leap', of 'the dialectical transition from quantity to quality', etc. In the notion of emergence Monod offers something that allows us, to a partial extent, to restate this question with intra-scientific elements.

<P>
I recapitulate: materialism, dialectics. Such are the components of <I>Element 1</I> in Monod. In the case of the modern biologist that Monod is, Element 1 is in direct resonance with a definite philosophical tendency: dialectical materialism.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
<I>Element 2 (of the SPS)</I>

<P>
I said that this element is extra-scientific and idealist. Here again, Monod is exemplary. Because <I>Element 2</I> appears in his work, almost in a pure state (this is not always the case with scientists), as a reprise of <I>Element 1 itself</I> under a modality and a tendency <I>completely opposed</I> to the modality and the tendency wherein we were able to locate <I>Element 1.</I> And in <I>Element 2</I> we are dealing with practically the same content as in <I>Element 1</I>, but there has been an inversion of meaning, an inversion of tendency. Let us take up the two components of <I>Element 1</I> - materialism and dialectics - to see what becomes of them in <I>Element 2.</I>

<P>
(a)&nbsp;M<FONT SIZE=-1>ATERIALISM</FONT>

<BR>
In <I>Element 1</I>, Monod defined the materialist content of his tendency by eliminating mechanism and vitalism, by saying that there is no 'living matter' but only 'living systems', and by designating DNA the 'physical support' of those living systems. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But when Monod leaves the domain of biology - which he calls, using an already suspicious term, the 'biosphere' (a Teilhardian term) - to speak of what - using an even more suspicious term - he calls the 'noosphere' (a Teilhardian term), he no longer respects the rules which govern the materialist content of <I>Element 1.</I> At this point, we see that as

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 150</B></FONT><P>

the concepts of <I>Element 1</I> are put to use, the <I>materialist</I> tendency that ruled Element 1 is inverted and becomes an <I>idealist</I> and even spiritualist tendency. The most striking symptom of this inversion is the inversion of Monod's attitude to Teilhard: in Element 1, Monod is 100 per cent against Teilhard. In Element 2, Monod resorts to two of Teilhard's concepts: the '<I>noosphere </I>' and the 'biosphere'. As we shall see, the result is that the dialectic component expressed by the concept of emergence becomes idealist itself and lapses back into the very thing Monod avoided in Element 1: namely, the spiritualism-mechanism couple. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To be precise, Monod proposes a theory of the birth of humanity:

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="400">
<TR>
<TD>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
</TD><TD>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<I>only the latest of these accidents could lead to the emergence in the heart<BR> of the biosphere of a new realm</I>, <I>the noosphere</I>, <I>the realm of ideas and<BR> knowledge</I>, <I>which was born on the day when the new associations</I>, <I>the<BR> creative combinations in an individual could be transmitted to others</I>,<BR> <I>rather than dying with him.</I>
</FONT>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
This thesis is then further specified: <I>language created man.</I> The realm of man is the noosphere. The noosphere is '<I>the kingdom of ideas and knowledge' .</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In making this extrapolation, Monod believes himself a materialist because for him language is not a spiritual origin, but simply an accidental emergence which has the informational resources of the <I>human central nervous system</I> as its biophysiological support. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Yet in his theory of the noosphere Monod is <I>in fact</I> (though not according to his stated convictions) idealist - to be precise, mechanistic-spiritualistic. Mechanistic because he believes he can give an account of the existence and content of the 'noosphere' in terms of the effects triggered by the emergence of the biophysiological support of language (the human central nervous system). In simple terms: he thinks he can account for the content of the social existence of men, including the history of their ideas, as a mere effect of the play of neurobiological mechanisms. To extend, without any scientific justification, biological laws to the social existence of mankind is mechanism. Monod insists on the legitimacy of this arbitrary extension: '<I>Although it is immaterial</I>, <I>and populated only by abstract structures</I>, <I>the noosphere presents close analogies to the biosphere from which it emerged</I>.' And he does not beat about the bush: he calls for the coming of the great mind 'who will be able to write <I>a sequel to the work of Darwin: a natural history of the selection of ideas' .</I> Monod does not even wait for this great mind to be born; without even charging him for it, he gives him a basis for the work to come: an astounding biologistic theory of ideas as endowed with the specific qualities of living species, dedicated to the same function and

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 151</B></FONT><P>

exposed to the same laws. There are ideas that possess an invasive power, others that are doomed to die out because they are parasitic species, still others ineluctably condemned to death by their rigidity. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We fall back with this great avant-garde biologist upon banalities which have existed for more than a century and which Malthus and Social Darwinism charged with ideological energy throughout the nineteenth century. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Theoretically speaking, Monod's <I>mechanism</I> resides in the following tendency: the mechanical application of the concepts and the laws of what he calls the biosphere to what he calls the 'noosphere', the application of the content of a materialism appropriate to the biological species to another real object: human societies. This is an idealist use of the materialist content of a determinate science (here, modern biology) in its extension to the object of another science. This idealist use of the materialist content of a determinate science consists of arbitrarily imposing upon another science - which possesses a real object, different from that of the first - the materialist content of the first science. Monod declares that the physical support of the biosphere is DNA. In the present state of biological science, this materialist thesis is unassailable. But when he believes himself to be materialist, by giving as the biophysiological basis of what he calls the 'noosphere' - that is to say, the social and historical existence of the human species - the emergence of the <I>neurobiological support of language</I>, he is not a materialist but, as we have already said, a 'mechanistic materialist' and in terms of a theory of human history, that now means that he is an <I>idealist.</I> For the mechanistic materialism that was materialism's historical representative in the eighteenth century is today no more than one of the representatives of the <I>idealist</I> tendency in history. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In so far as Monod is a <I>mechanist</I>, he is necessarily also a <I>spiritualist.</I> His theory that language created mankind might find a sympathetic audience among certain philosophers of anthropology, of literature and, indeed, of psychoanalysis. But we should be suspicious of sympathetic audiences: it is in their interest deliberately to misunderstand what is said to them in order to hear what they want to hear. They may be correct in what they want to hear, but they are wrong in hearing it in what is said to them. The theory that language created humanity is, in <I>Monod's lecture</I>, a spiritualist theory which ignores the specificity of the materiality of the object in question. To say that language created man is to say that it is not <I>the materiality of social conditions of existence</I>, but what Monod himself calls 'the <I>immateriality </I>' of the noosphere, 'this realm of ideas and knowledge', which constitutes the real base, and thus the principle, of the scientific intelligibility of human history. No essential difference separates these theses, which Monod believes to be 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 152</B></FONT><P>

scientific but which are in reality merely ideological, from the most classical theses of conventional spiritualism. Indeed, when one has given as the sole material base of the noosphere the biophysiological support of the central nervous system, one has to fill the void of the 'noosphere' with the help of the Spirit, because there is no other recourse - and certainly no scientific recourse. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is in this manner that the <I>materialism</I> of <I>Element 1</I> is inverted into idealism in <I>Element 2</I> of Monod's SPS. The inversion of the tendency affects the same content (the same concepts): in Monod the idealistic tendency is constituted as an effect of the mechanism-spiritualism couple. The logical genealogy of this inversion can be retraced: material- ism at the start, then mechanism-spiritualism, and finally idealism. In Monod's case, mechanism is the precise point of sensibility, the point where the inversion takes place. <I>A mechanistic use of biological materialism outside biology</I>, <I>in history</I>, <I>has the effect of inverting the materialist tendency into an idealist tendency.</I>

<P>
(b)&nbsp;D<FONT SIZE=-1>IALECTICS</FONT>

<BR>
The same inversion. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In <I>Element 1</I>, the dialectic is materialist; it is present in the concept of emergence. This concept of <I>emergence</I> functions adequately from the scientific point of view in the domain of biological science. It functions in a materialist way. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But when we leave the sphere of biology for the noosphere, the concept of emergence loses its original scientific content and is contaminated by the manner in which Monod thinks the nature of his new object: history. In history, the dialectic functions in an astonishing fashion. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>First</I>, emergence proliferates: a true <I>deus ex machina.</I> Each time something new happens - a new idea, a new event - Monod utters the magic word 'emergence'. As a general rule, it might be said that when a concept is used to think everything, it is in danger of not thinking anything at all. This is the failing Hegel once denounced in Schelling, who applied his theory of poles everywhere: <I>formalism.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[3]</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Then</I>, emergence functions in history not in the form appropriate to history but in the form proper to biology: witness the theory of the natural selection of ideas - an old imposture which Monod believes to be new. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>Finally</I>, whether we like it or not, and despite what Monod has said

</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 153</B></FONT><P>

about the primacy of emergence over teleonomy, and despite the excellence of his criticisms of Teilhard and the finalists, <I>it is the emergence of the noosphere - in other words</I>, <I>the emergence of the Spirit - that forms the basis of history for Monod </I>; because the noosphere is, scientifically speaking, an empty concept; because emergence and the noosphere are constantly associated, in a repeated manner, there results an objective philosophical effect in the mind - not, presumably, in Monod's mind but in that of his listeners and readers. This empty repetition in fact produces the effect of an inversion of sense and tendency: <I>whether we like it or not</I>, <I>it is as though the noosphere were the most complex</I>, <I>finest and most extraordinary of the whole sequence of emergences </I>; thus it is a valorized product, if not  <I>de jure</I> (Monod does not say so), then <I>de facto.</I> The sudden and miraculous multiplication of emergences in the noosphere is only a kind of empirical manifestation of this <I>de facto</I> privilege, which is a privilege none the less; the noosphere is the privileged sphere of the functioning of emergence. Thus the relationship is upset and it appears as if the sequence of emergences had, as its hidden end and teleonomy, the emergence of the noosphere. Monod might contest this interpretation. However, because he does not control the notions he manipulates in the domain of history, because he believes them to be scientific, whereas they are merely ideological, it is not surprising that he perceives only the <I>intention</I> of his discourse and not its <I>objective</I> effect. The dialectic, which is materialist in <I>Element 1</I>, has become idealist in <I>Element 2 </I>: an inversion of tendency. I openly acknowledge that what I have just said has not really been proven, since I speak only of an 'effect' of listening or reading, which in itself is imperceptible outside a <I>convergence</I> of diverse effects: I will analyse <I>two more of these effects</I> to reinforce what has been said.

<P>
  1.&nbsp;Monod provides a definition of emergence which in fact contains two very different definitions. His lecture opens with this definition. I quote: 'Emergence is the property of reproducing and multiplying highly complex ordered structures and of permitting the evolutionary creation of structures of increasing complexity.' 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It would be fascinating to analyse closely this very thoughtful but lame formula because it contains two different definitions, two different characteristics, though in one and the same concept. Emergence is a double property: reproduction <I>and</I> creation. Everything is in the 'and'. For the property of reproduction is one thing, the property of creation another. It is clear that the latter has scientific meaning in biology only on the basis of the former: if living forms did not have the property of reproduction and multiplication, nothing new could appear among them, and be both alive and more complex. Thus there is a link between 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 154</B></FONT><P>

reproduction and creation. But there is also a difference or a break: the unexpected appearance of the new, more complex than what preceded it. The small word 'and' linking reproduction and creation in Monod may lead to two realities being confused; at any rate, it <I>juxtaposes</I> them. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Now, a juxtaposition might be insufficient from a scientific point of view. Thus Monod does not adequately think through, beginning with the definition which is manifestly intended to designate one of the essential components of <I>Element 1</I> of the SPS, what he has <I>said</I> Monod does not really <I>distinguish</I> the two properties in his definition. And yet, in the domain of the biological sciences, his scientific practice makes a perfectly clear distinction between properties which his definition simply juxtaposes: there are reproduction-multiplication phenomena and the phenomenon of sudden appearances. When Monod causes the term emergence to intervene in his scientific expos&eacute;, it is practically always to designate the sudden appearance of new forms: reproduction always remains in the shadows. Indeed, it does not play any scientific role in thinking the sudden appearance of new forms: it only shows that we are dealing with life, with forms which reproduce and multiply. This question is resolved by DNA. Thus, in his practice Monod very dearly makes a <I>distinction</I> which he does not think in his definition, unless one considers that he thinks it under the form of the conjunction 'and', which is insufficient. Hegel wrote many interesting things on the usage scientists make in their language and practice of that little word 'and'. Scientists should read these pages, which directly concern them (<I>The Phenomenology of Mind </I>). As we proceed with this analysis, I hope that this definition of emergence will produce in its central silence (the word '<I>and </I>') an effect similar to that of the 'creation' (an unfortunate word) of new forms of 'increasing' complexity, that it will allow the notion of emergence to cease being something that remains unthought and functions as an unthought finality, and therefore to change tendency: from materialism to idealism.

  2.&nbsp;Analogous considerations might be developed in relation to the concept of <I>chance</I> in Monod. In fact, the concept of emergence is clearly bound up with the concept of chance. In biology chance is in a sense a precise index of the conditions of possibility of emergence. So be it. Since Epicurus it has played a positive materialist role in combating finalist exploitations of biology. But we then find that Monod retains the concept of <I>chance</I> when he moves from biology to history, to the noosphere. Practically, then, the emergence/chance couple permits Monod to think as emergences based on <I>chance</I> phenomena that are perfectly explicable on the basis of a science of history, whose existence he neither mentions nor even suspects. In most of Monod's historical

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 155</B></FONT><P>

examples (Shakespeare, Communism, Stalin, etc.), chance functions in a sense that is the <I>opposite</I> of the way it functions in biology: not as an index of the conditions of the existence of emergence, but as <I>a biologistic theory of history itself.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  A striking symptom of this inversion is provided by Monod's historical Darwinism. While he does not cause the theory of natural selection to intervene in biology, he resorts to it suddenly and on a grand scale in history, speaking of the great mind who will write a history of 'the selection of ideas'. It is unusual to see a notion like natural selection, a notion which biology has strictly delimited or even profoundly transformed, suddenly being put to full use in history. It is clear that for Monod the underdevelopment of history justifies an uncontrolled and excessive use of the concept, in a way which has nothing in common with the use biology itself makes of it. In any event, the result that interests us is this: through its uncontrolled use, chance changes its meaning and tendency. It has passed from a materialist to an idealist functioning. And as chance is bound up with emergence, emergence too is transformed. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  I will therefore summarize in a word - or in little more than a word - what we have said in the course of analysing the content of <I>Elements 1</I> and <I>2</I> of Monod's SPS. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Monod's SPS is a <I>borderline SPS</I>, and it is exemplary in its simplicity and clarity. It is remarkable in that it reveals that the distinction introduced in our previous lectures between Element 1 and Element 2 affects not only the <I>conceptual content</I> of the two elements, but also <I>the different tendencies with which a single content may be invested.</I> The content of the two elements of Monod's SPS is essentially the same. It is constituted by a certain number of key concepts: in Monod's case, the concepts of matter, physical support, living system, chance, and emergence. These are the concepts common to the two elements. The concept of the <I>noosphere</I> is then added to <I>Element 2</I>, but because the concept of <I>biosphere</I> figures in <I>Element 1</I>, it might be thought that we are dealing with the complement that the concept of biosphere carries within it. The content of Elements 1 and 2 is therefore essentially the <I>same content.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  However, there is, as we have said, a <I>contradiction</I> between the two elements: <I>Element 1</I> is materialist and <I>Element 2</I> is idealist. This contradiction cannot affect the content of the two elements because the content is common to them: it therefore affects their <I>meaning</I> the significance of the use made of them - that is, the <I>tendency</I> with which explicit or implicit use invests them. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  From this we may conclude that the contradiction between Element 1 and Element 2 of Monod's SPS is <I>a contradiction between the materialist and idealist tendencies</I> in relation to his representation of the content of his scientific knowledges (the current state of biology), of the validity of 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 156</B></FONT><P>

the use and extension of his key concepts, and of the nature of scientific knowledge in general. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We may also note that the materialist tendency (<I>Element 1 </I>) can be positively asserted <I>only</I> in the struggle against idealist, spiritualist and religious philosophical exploitations of the problems of biology (the struggle against Teilhard), and therefore that <I>Element 1</I> is not a pure statement of the reality of scientific practice, but a result that must be won in a polemical struggle. But we may note at the same time that the idealist tendency which, in the form of its representatives (Teilhard), was expelled from <I>Element 1</I>, in fact reappears in the idealist <I>Element 2.</I> The proof: we find that in <I>Element 2</I> one of Teilhard's key concepts has re-entered through the window: the concept of the <I>noosphere.</I> The idealist tendency against which Monod struggles, with all his strength, in order to make the materialist tendency in <I>Element 1</I> triumph, secretly re-enters through the window to triumph in <I>Element 2.</I> What is tragic is that it is Monod himself who opens the window. And because we cannot theoretically compare a scientist to a man who willingly opens a window to let the wind of idealism rush in, we say that it is the wind of idealism itself that opens the window. It has all the power necessary. All that may be said of Monod is that he does not <I>prevent the window from being opened.</I> He does not resist the idealist tendency; indeed, he gives in to it, thinking that he resists it. Which proves that <I>Element 2</I> is always stronger than <I>Element 1.</I> Which proves that the SPS cannot with its forces alone prevent the window from being opened. And which proves that the SPS needs the support of an external force, allied with <I>Element 1</I>, if it is to triumph over <I>Element 2</I>, the support of an external tendency that reinforces the materialist tendency of Element 1 to reverse the meaning of the idealist tendency of <I>Element 2.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We may finally take note of something important that recapitulates what I have said concerning the differential receptivity of scientists to certain terms, such as materialism, according to their discipline. In Monod's case - modern biology - the notions of <I>materialism</I> and of the <I>dialectic</I> not only pose no problems (at least in the branch in which Monod works) but they 'work' quite well with the content of Element 1. In the case of modern biology, or at least the branch to which Monod has devoted his work, the expression <I>dialectical materialism</I> may be admissible, at least provisionally and 'pending further information'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But as I am speaking not only to an audience of biologists, but also to many other scientists and literary specialists, I can imagine what they are thinking. To address only those who are really and truly in a different world from Monod, I can guess what the mathematicians are thinking. What I have just said of a biologist may perhaps apply to biology. But mathematics? You know the famous passage from Sartre's <I>Words</I>, in

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 157</B></FONT><P>

which he explains that he has no 'superego'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90ii.html#fnp157">4</A>]</FONT> The superego, when it exists, is that of others. The SPS, when it exists, is that of others. I would simply point out to the mathematicians present that, should they ever think <I>in petto</I> that they are saved by the grace of mathematics (its grace - that is, not only its beauty but also its purity and its rigour) from any SPS, there are a considerable number of texts by great mathematicians which might be analysed as I have just analysed Monod's text, and it is highly probable that such an analysis would produce similar results. And to give a precise example, I call their attention to the existence of a short text by Lichnerowitz, delivered to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise de Philosophie on 27 February 1965. This text bears a title that I would never have dared to invent: <I>Mathematical Activity and its Role in our Conception of the World.</I> I want to point out that in the subsequent debate Cartan made some very interesting comments. In this discussion, the roles were clearly demarcated. Lichnerowitz's arguments were openly <I>idealist</I>, those of Cartan were rather <I>materialist.</I> They may rest assured: mathematicians too have an SPS. They too, in their SPS, are contradictory representatives of tendencies that transcend them and confront each other: the materialist (Element 1) and the idealist (Element 2). And to ensure that no one feels left out, I will say: philosophers too, but in the case of philosophers, their SPS is not a philosophy but their world-view.

3.&nbsp;Philosophy
</B>

<P>
After all I have just said, I will speak only briefly of the two last characters in our little theatre: philosophy and world-view. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Philosophy is present in Monod's lecture in two forms: first in the form of <I>philosophical terms borrowed from existing philosophies</I>, which function in the interior of his spontaneous philosophy. In so far as these terms are borrowed from existing philosophies, they refer back to those philosophies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Philosophy is also present in the form of <I>explicit philosophical arguments.</I> Monod knows what philosophies are, or at least knows that they exist and are particularly concerned with what happens in the sciences. In this connection he cites Aristotle, the philosophies of Kant and Hegel, dialectical materialism, Engels (whom he attacks with particular violence), Nietzsche and Teilhard de Chardin. Monod is particularly perspicacious in his materialist moment - that is, in his attack on Teilhard. He says that this philosophy is not new - an insight

</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 158</B></FONT><P>

which pleases us but will by no means please everyone. Monod is not content simply to cite philosophers; he does philosophy. He even proposes a definition of philosophy, by saying that its function is 'above all to establish a system of values' and contrasting it with the sciences, which have nothing to do with values. On this theme, he develops a whole philosophical argument. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The most remarkable philosophical terms present in Monod's course are the following: noosphere/biosphere (Teilhard, condemned as a philosophical exploiter of biology, resurfaces as the positive philosopher of the noosphere - that is, of human history); alienation, praxis, nothingness (in Nietzsche's sense), etc. Further, an entire series of apparently innocent notions are employed and function philosophically in Monod: for example, the notion of <I>man</I>, in the phrase: '<I>it is language that seems to have created man rather than man language' .</I> There is no need to go further. We are in a philosophical atmosphere with an idealist allure (certain words are never pronounced: materialism, dialectical, etc.) or, more precisely, with an existentialist-spiritualist-Nietzschean-atheist allure. A self-declared <I>atheism</I> emerges in the final words, in which Sartre, like Nietzsche, would find it as difficult to disown their child as to recognize him: '<I>What ideal may we propose to men today</I>, <I>an ideal which is both above them and beyond them</I>, <I>if not the conquest through knowledge of the nothingness they themselves have discovered?'</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  More interesting is the fact that Monod has given us a genuine chapter of philosophy in the strong sense: that is, a chapter of philosophy that bears directly on the relation between philosophy and the sciences. A distinction between philosophy and the sciences. Knowledge, not values, belongs to the sciences. Values belong to philosophy. A distinction between scientific method and scientific ethics: '<I>Even today</I>, <I>the ethics of knowledge is often confused with scientific method itself. But method is a normative epistemology</I>, <I>not an ethics. Method tells us to seek. But what commands us to seek and to adopt a method, and the asceticism it implies</I>, <I>in order to seek? </I>' Sciences, scientific method, normative epistemology, ethics of knowledge, values, philosophy. Monod has done his philosophical work very well: he draws lines of demarcation and proposes a line that is for him, and for any philosopher, a 'correct line'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  There is no point in quibbling over certain of Monod's philosophical expressions, for he is not a professional philosopher and that would be unfair. On the contrary, we should be very grateful to him for having expounded his philosophy and, through it, his relation to the existing philosophical tendencies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Monod's philosophical tendency (resulting from the comparison between the kind of terms he borrows and the philosophical argument

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 159</B></FONT><P>

he puts forward): an idealist-spiritualist tendency accompanied by a categorical declaration of <I>atheism.</I> The result: the primacy of an atheist <I>ethics.</I> Spiritualism is severed from its religious moorings by the declaration of atheism, leaving, in the final analysis, an atheist <I>ethics </I>: a morality of science or, more precisely, an ethics of scientific practice. An ascetic morality, austere, aristocratic in its austerity, without any other object of reference than the practice of knowledge (a refusal to give this morality the foundation of human happiness, its material power, or a 'know thyself').

<P>
What interests us in a very precise sense <I>is the organic relation that exists between Monod's philosophy and his SPS.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The same atheist idealist tendency. The same accent on scientific practice. In philosophy as in the SPS, the presence of an objectivist <I>materialist</I> reference, the ultimate core of which is <I>scientific knowledge and its practice </I>; while at the same time, in philosophy as in the SPS, the materialist tendency is surrounded by the idealist tendency that dominates it. We have seen how this investment is carried out in Monod's SPS. We have established the existence of the same idealist investment in Monod's <I>philosophy </I>; but what is extremely remarkable - and I ask you to note this point because it is of the greatest importance - this siege does not take the form of an <I>inversion of meaning</I> whose moments and terms we might observe and describe in detail, empirically. There is a certain tension, and therefore a certain presence of the tendential struggle between idealism and materialism, in Monod's philosophy (the fact that he speaks of science might be considered an echo of the <I>materialist tendency</I>, especially in that he rejects religion; his morality might be considered an overt and dominant representation of the <I>idealist tendency </I>). But it is clear that this tension, and the outcome of this conflict, have been <I>decided in advance</I> in favour of the <I>idealist tendency</I>, which triumphs without a struggle in the exaltation of the ethics of knowledge. What is the underlying element in these links, which are merely statements of objective relations, that binds Monod's philosophy to his SPS? Essentially, what they have in common or, to be more specific, what his philosophy has <I>in common</I> with Element 2 of the SPS: an idealist philosophy of <I>science</I> that allows the extension of biological categories to the 'noosphere', authorizing a conception of the 'noosphere' based on an idealist theory of history, which permits the exaltation of the ethics of knowledge to a place in the philosophy of science. Their common content can be written in the form of a sequence of transformed identities:

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 160</B></FONT><P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="402">

<TD>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
</TD><TD>
(emergence of the noosphere) History = noosphere = realm of<BR> (scientific) knowledge = scientific activity = ethics of<BR> scientific knowledge.
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
This sequence, which we could examine in detail, rests in the last resort on the two following identities: <I>history</I> = <I>noosphere</I> = (the) <I>science</I>(s). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What therefore permits Monod's philosophy in the last resort to communicate with his SPS is the philosophical <I>operator 'noosphere'</I>, whose meaning (the effect of its intervention) may be simply understood by saying that it represents a conception of history classic since the eighteenth century, since the <I>Aufkl&auml;rung</I>, wherein it is the sciences that are the motor of history, and history is ultimately reducible to the history of knowledges, of the sciences and scientific ideas. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But Monod's philosophy of science is not merely a <I>philosophy of science </I>: like every philosophy of science, it is <I>a more or less openly avowed philosophy of history.</I> If Monod is exemplary here, it is because he openly avows his <I>philosophy of history.</I> It is through it that we shall enter into the last object of our analysis: his <I>world-view.</I>

<BR>&nbsp;<P>

<B>
4.&nbsp;Monod's World-View (WV)
</B>

<P>
Remember what we have said about the difference that distinguishes a philosophy from a world-view. A world-view may well deal with science, but a world-view is never centred on science as philosophy is. It does not maintain the same relations with the sciences as philosophy does. A world-view is centred on something other than the sciences: on what we have called the values of <I>practical ideologies.</I> A world-view expresses tendencies that traverse practical ideologies (religious, juridical, political, etc.). A WV is always directly or indirectly concerned with the questions that pertain to these domains: problems of religion, morality, politics, and ultimately with the problem of the meaning of history, of the salvation of human history. Every WV finally expresses a certain tendency of a <I>political character</I> or appearance. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What is remarkable about Monod is that this is all in the open. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  At the centre of his WV, the problem of the <I>alienation</I> of the modern world, and of the salvation of the modern world. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The alienation of the modern world: created, woven by science, it is a stranger in its own land. Why?

<P>
The alienation of the modern world therefore threatens the great socialist dream itself. Monod is for socialism, but concerned for its future. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Alienation: dualism. Between the science and scientific culture that have woven the modern world, on the one hand, and traditional values ('ideas rich in ethical content'), on the other.

<I>We are therefore faced with the following contradiction: modern societies still live</I>, <I>assert and teach - without believing in them - value-systems whose base has been destroyed</I>, <I>but</I>, <I>having been woven by science</I>, <I>those same societies owe their emergence to the adoption</I>, <I>usually implicitly and by a very small number of men</I>, <I>of an ethics of knowledge of which they know nothing. That is the very root of modern alienation.</I>
</FONT>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
Double contradiction:

<P>
- modern science and outdated religious moral values whose base has been destroyed;
<BR>
- modern science and the failure of men, and even scientists themselves, to recognize that these sciences and their practice imply a moral discipline, a veritable ethics of knowledge.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Now, in the contradiction of the modern world between contemporary science and earlier anachronistic values, there is both <I>extreme alienation</I> and the <I>means of salvation</I>, which are contained in an ethics of scientific knowledge. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What is this theory of the <I>alienation</I> of the modern world? Apparently a description of a certain number of empirical facts. In reality, two things:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;<I>a theory of history </I>; 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;<I>a politics.</I>

<P>
The theory of history may be summarized thus. Monod knows that human history is not exclusively constituted by what happens in the order of scientific knowledge. There also exists an order of 'praxis', of material power, of religious, moral and political passions. But Monod thinks that what is specific to man, what makes him a social and historical being, what constitutes the 'noosphere', is language and the scientific knowledge which emerges from it at a certain moment. In any 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 162</B></FONT><P>

event, it is clear to Monod that in the <I>modern</I> world science is the basis of history, that the activity of the scientist weaves the modern world, and that its salvation lies in a scientific ethics. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This theory of history opens on to a politics: a politics of the elaboration and diffusion of the ethics of knowledge. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The basis of the <I>modern</I> world is scientific knowledge. The motor of the salvation of <I>modern</I> history may be the ethics of knowledge. Monod therefore advances a WV that proposes <I>a</I> politics of education, communication and moral propaganda. A specific moral doctrine, but a moral doctrine just the same, from which he expects political effects - including, if I understand him correctly, the hope of the advent of socialism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  There are two points to be noted:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;In Monod's WV there exists an internally consistent unity between a philosophy of history (an idealist philosophy which makes knowledge the essence and lever of history) and a politics (an ethical politics). Every WV is directly or indirectly related to <I>a certain politics.</I> Every WV advances, directly or indirectly, explicitly or implicitly, <I>a certain politics.</I> This is true of all world-views. A religious WV emphasizes religion, religious values: it proposes a choice between different values, it proposes a politics that can be translated into deeds. <I>Idem</I> a moral WV. The same is true of a juridical WV (to emphasize law, seen as the essential factor in the dialectic of history, is to seek to produce certain historical effects: this kind of WV is common amongst jurists, but it is not unique to them). A political WV emphasizes political values: it assumes that politics constitutes the essential factor in history, that politics is the motor of history, etc., and from this it expects certain effects.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;A WV does not exist in isolation: it exists only in a defined field in which it seeks to <I>situate itself vis-&agrave;-vis</I> existing world-views, and therefore to distinguish itself from existing WVs, to define itself as different in relation to them, including <I>by opposition</I> to certain of them. A WV is posited only by opposing and, ultimately, by struggling against the WVs different from it. In his WV, Monod manifestly attempts to distinguish himself from two world-views: from the <I>religious</I> WV (of the Teilhard variety) and the <I>Marxist</I> WV. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Against the <I>religious</I> WV he asserts that neither religious values, nor traditional moral values based on religion, can save the modern world (hence a struggle against religious WVs), but only a new morality, a non-religious, atheistic, ascetic morality based on scientific practice, the morality of scientists.

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 163</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Against the <I>Marxist</I> WV he asserts that it is the development of knowledge and the values proper to it which are the motor of modern history, and therefore that what will put an end to the alienation of the modern world is a certain subjective aristocratic-intellectual morality, and not the 'Marxist morality' based on the proletarian class struggle. Note this very important point: Monod does not <I>differentiate</I> himself in the same way from the two world-views. He differentiates himself from the religious WV by <I>struggling</I> against it overtly, to suppress it, for he sees it as harmful and outdated. He also differentiates himself from the Marxist WV, but <I>without seeking to suppress it.</I> He declares war on the first but not on the second. He has not renounced the dream it still embodies for him, the dream of 'socialism'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Monod's world-view is thus very specific. It is a WV which proposes a theory or a philosophy of history capable of furnishing an interpretation of the present historical conjuncture and the means of exiting from it; this naturally results in a politics. As a WV this conception takes sides, and is necessarily situated <I>among the existing WVs.</I> It takes a position between a traditionalist WV, dominated by a religious moral politics, and a Marxist WV, dominated by what we might call a <I>political</I> 'morality'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But here we find that everything changes, not from the point of view of Monod's <I>declarations</I> but from the point of view of the real content of his theoretical theses. For this intermediate position is not equal. Monod's position is not equidistant from the two WVs. What separates Monod from the religious WV, which he combats so resolutely, does not call into question the validity of <I>morality</I> as the motor of history; it is simply that the morality he proposes is not a religious morality but an atheist morality centred on the spontaneous ethics of scientific knowledge; this morality, however, remains a morality. What separates Monod from the Marxist WV, on the other hand, is much more important. It is a serious difference over the question of the <I>role of morality in history.</I> For Monod, morality is considered to be, and is then proposed as, the means of salvation for modern history and therefore as the motor, if not of history, at least of modern history. For Marxism, morality, even a political morality, <I>is not the motor of history</I>, past or modern. In the expression I have just used, 'political morality', it is the word <I>political</I> that counts for Marxists; and politics means 'class struggle of the masses', as defined by the two great principles of Marxism: (1) it is the masses that make history (not individuals, intellectuals or even scientists); (2) it is the class struggle that is the motor of history, not morality - not even an atheist, ascetic morality, a pure and disinterested morality of the most disinterested of intellectuals, scientists. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What divides the WVs is definitely something that goes beyond their 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 164</B></FONT><P>

ideological content and touches upon their political tendency. Idealism = the belief that <I>ideas rule the world</I>/Materialism = the belief <I>that the class struggle of the masses is the motor of history.</I> On this fundamental point Monod's theoretical theses enter into contradiction with the way he has <I>situated</I> his WV <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> the religious and Marxist WVs. The contradiction, the essential opposition, concerns not the religious WV but the Marxist WV; not idealism but materialism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   One last word: how is the relationship between Monod's WV and his philosophy established? Through the intermediary of the ethics of scientific knowledge. Monod's philosophy is a philosophy of science; his WV is a WV of scientific ethics. Monod's philosophy and his WV have <I>science</I> in common. <I>Science</I> lies at the heart of Monod's SPS. And finally, <I>science</I> is Monod's activity. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And one last conclusion: if these four characters or elements that we have identified in Monod's text (science, SPS, philosophy, WV) are plotted on a graph, a very particular overlapping may be seen to occur.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   1. NUCLEUS 1. = <I>the reality of science</I> that exists in the reality of the scientific findings Monod describes, which allude to the reality of scientific practice, and to the reality of the history of the production of biological knowledges. The <I>materialist</I> tendency. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>This nucleus 1 irradiates</I> the set with its materialist-dialectical tendency. It is present in the tendency of <I>Element 1</I> of Monod's SPS. It is present, in a very modified and extremely attenuated fashion, in Monod's philosophy. There are some negative traces (atheistic morality) in Monod's WV.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   2. NUCLEUS 2. = <I>reality</I>, what is at the heart of Monod's WV: a <I>political prise de position</I> against other political positions. An idealist

tendency that asserts itself in a subordinate fashion against the religious-spiritualist tendency, but asserts itself in a dominant fashion against the materialist tendency of the class struggle. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>This nucleus 2 irradiates</I> the entire set of elements present in Monod's text: its irradiating tendency is idealist. It is idealist in an inverse way, in an increasingly attenuated fashion, but the filiation and the dependence are clearly recognizable: it is dependent on <I>philosophy</I> (the idealist philosophy of science); on <I>Element 2</I> of the SPS: an idealist interpretation of the materialist content of Element 1. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This result is simple but very important: two irradiating nuclei, centres of opposed tendencies - a <I>materialist tendency</I> radiating from the material-objective nucleus of scientific practice and science itself (<I>nucleus 1 </I>); and an <I>idealist tendency</I> radiating from Monod's ideological position in the face of 'values' implied by the social-political-ideological problems that divide the modern world (<I>nucleus 2 </I>). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Monod's SPS, philosophy and WV are, in their various ways and depending upon their proximity to these two nuclei, compromises between these two tendencies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The point at which the two tendencies clash most openly <I>is the SPS </I>; in the contradiction between Element 1 and Element 2. In this contradiction, the dominant element is Element 2. Here too, when we closely examine the confrontation of the two tendencies and the realist-materialist nucleus - that is, scientific practice - we find the law which I stated earlier: the domination of Element 1 by Element 2; the exploitation of Element 1 by Element 2.
