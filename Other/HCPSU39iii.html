<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   After the Fourteenth Congress, the Party launched a vigorous struggle for the realization of the general line of the Soviet Government -- the <I>Socialist industrialization</I> of the country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In the restoration period the task had been to revive agriculture before all else, so as to obtain raw materials and foodstuffs, to restore and to set going the industries, the existing mills and factories. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Soviet Government coped with this task with comparative ease. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But in the restoration period there were three major shortcomings: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      First, the mills and factories were old, equipped with worn-out and antiquated machinery, and might soon go out of commission. The task now was to re-equip them on up-to-date lines. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Secondly, industry in the restoration period rested on too narrow a foundation: it lacked machine-building plants absolutely indispensable to the country. Hundreds of these plants had to be built, for without them no country can be considered as being really industrialized. The task now was to build these plants and to equip them on up-to-date lines. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Thirdly, the industries in this period were mostly light industries. These were developed and put on their feet. But, beyond a certain point, the further development even of the light industries met an obstacle in the weakness of heavy industry, not to mention the fact that the country had other requirements which could be satisfied only by a well-developed heavy industry. The task now was to tip the scales in favour of heavy industry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      All these new tasks were to be accomplished by the policy of Socialist industrialization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      It was necessary to build up a large number of new industries, industries which had not existed in tsarist Russia -- new machinery, machine 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 281</B></FONT><P>

tool, automobile, chemical, and iron and steel plants -- to organize the production of engines and power equipment, and to increase the mining of ore and coal. This was essential for the victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It was necessary to create a new munitions industry, to erect new works for the production of artillery, shells, aircraft, tanks and machine guns. This was essential for the defence of the U.S.S.R., surrounded as it was by a capitalist world. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It was necessary to build tractor works and plants for the production of modern agricultural machinery, and to furnish agriculture with these machines, so as to enable millions of small individual peasant farms to pass to large-scale collective farming. This was essential for the victory of Socialism in the countryside. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    All this was to be achieved by the policy of industrialization, for that is what the Socialist industrialization of the country meant. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Clearly, construction work on so large a scale would necessitate the investment of thousands of millions of rubles. To count on foreign loans was out of the question, for the capitalist countries refused to grant loans. We had to build with our own resources, without foreign assistance. But we were then a poor country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    There lay one of the chief difficulties. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Capitalist countries as a rule built up their heavy industries with funds obtained from abroad, whether by colonial plunder, or by exacting indemnities from vanquished nations, or else by foreign loans. The Soviet Union could not as a matter of principle resort to such infamous means of obtaining funds as the plunder of colonies or of vanquished nations. As for foreign loans, that avenue was closed to the U.S.S.R., as the capitalist countries refused to lend it anything. The funds had to be found <I>inside</I> the country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     And they were found. Financial sources were tapped in the U.S.S.R. such as could not be tapped in any capitalist country. The Soviet state had taken over all the mills, factories, and lands which the October Socialist Revolution had wrested from the capitalists and landlords, all the means of transportation, the banks, and home and foreign trade. The profits from the state-owned mills and factories, and from the means of transportation, trade and the banks now went to further the expansion of industry, and not into the pockets of a parasitic capitalist class. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Soviet Government had annulled the tsarist debts, on which the people had annually paid hundreds of millions of gold rubles in interest alone. By abolishing the right of the landlords to the land, the Soviet Government had freed the peasantry from the annual payment of about 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 282</B></FONT><P>

500,000,000 gold rubles in rent. Released from this burden, the peasantry was in a position to help the state to build a new and powerful industry. The peasants had a vital interest in obtaining tractors and other agricultural machinery. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    All these sources of revenue were in the hands of the Soviet state. They could yield hundreds and thousands of millions of rubles for the creation of a heavy industry. All that was needed was a business-like approach, the strictly economical expenditure of funds, rationalization of industry, reduction of costs of production, elimination of unproductive expenditure, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And this was the course the Soviet Government adopted. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Thanks to a regime of strict economy, the funds available for capital development increased from year to year. This made it possible to start on gigantic construction works like the Dnieper Hydro-Electric Power Station, the Turkestan-Siberian Railway, the Stalingrad Tractor Works, a number of machine-tool works, the AMO (ZIS) Automobile Works and others. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Whereas in 1926-27 about 1,000,000,000 rubles were invested in industry, three years later it was found possible to invest about 5,000,000,000 rubles. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Industrialization was making steady headway. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The capitalist countries looked upon the growing strength of the Socialist economic system in the U.S.S.R. as a threat to the existence of the capitalist system. Accordingly, the imperialist governments did everything they could to bring new pressure to bear on the U.S.S.R., to create a feeling of uncertainty and uneasiness in the country, and to frustrate, or at least to impede, the industrialization of the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In May 1927, the British Conservative Die-hards, then in office, organized a provocative raid on Arcos (the Soviet trading body in Great Britain). On May 26, 1927, the British Conservative Government broke off diplomatic and trade relations with the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On June 7, 1927, Comrade Voikov, the Soviet Ambassador in Warsaw, was assassinated by a Russian Whiteguard, a naturalized Polish subject. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     About this time, too, in the U.S.S.R itself, British spies and diversionists hurled bombs at a meeting in a Party club in Leningrad, wounding about 30 people, some of them severely. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the summer of 1927, almost simultaneous raids were made on the Soviet Embassies and Trade Representations in Berlin, Peking, Shanghai and Tientsin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This created additional difficulties for the Soviet Government. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 283</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But the U.S.S.R. refused to be intimidated and easily repulsed the provocative attempts of the imperialists and their agents. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    No less were the difficulties caused to the Party and the Soviet state by the subversive activities of the Trotskyites and other oppositionists. Comrade Stalin had good reason to say that "something like a united front from Chamberlain to Trotsky is being formed" against the Soviet Government. In spite of the decisions of the Fourteenth Party Congress and the professions of loyalty of the oppositionists, the latter had not laid down their arms. On the contrary, they intensified their efforts to undermine and split the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In the summer of 1926, the Trotskyites and Zinovievites united to form an anti-Party bloc, made it a rallying point for the remnants of all the defeated opposition groups, and laid the foundation of their secret anti-Leninist party, thereby grossly violating the Party Rules and the decisions of Party congresses forbidding the formation of factions. The Central Committee of the Party gave warning that unless this anti Party bloc -- which resembled the notorious Menshevik August Bloc -- were dissolved, matters might end badly for its adherents. But the supporters of the bloc would not desist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    That autumn, on the eve of the Fifteenth Party Conference, they made a sortie at Party meetings in the factories of Moscow, Leningrad and other cities, attempting to force a new discussion on the Party. The platform they tried to get the Party members to discuss was a rehash of the usual Trotskyite-Menshevik anti-Leninist platform. The Party members gave the oppositionists a severe rebuff, and in some places simply ejected them from the meetings. The Central Committee again warned the supporters of the bloc, stating that the Party could not tolerate their subversive activities any longer. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The opposition then submitted to the Central Committee a statement signed by Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Sokolnikov condemning their own factional work and promising to be loyal in the future. Nevertheless, the bloc continued to exist and its adherents did not stop their underhand work against the Party. They went on banding together their anti-Leninist party, started an illegal printing press, collected membership dues from their supporters and circulated their platform. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In view of the behaviour of the Trotskyites and Zinovievites, the Fifteenth Party Conference (November 1926) and the Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (December 1926) discussed the question of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites and adopted resolutions stigmatizing the adherents of this bloc as splitters whose platform was downright Menshevism. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 284</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But even this failed to bring them to their senses. In 1927, just when the British Conservatives broke off diplomatic and trade relations with the U.S.S.R., the bloc attacked the Party with renewed vigour. It concocted a new anti-Leninist platform, the so-called "Platform of the Eighty-Three" and began to circulate it among Party members, at the same time demanding that the Central Committee open a new general Party discussion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was perhaps the most mendacious and pharisaical of all opposition platforms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In their platform, the Trotskyites and Zinovievites professed that they had no objection to observing Party decisions and that they were all in favour of loyalty, but in reality they grossly violated the Party decisions, and scoffed at the very idea of loyalty to the Party and to its Central Committee. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In their platform, they professed they had no objection to Party unity and were against splits, but in reality they grossly violated Party unity, worked for a split, and already had their own, illegal, anti-Leninist party which had all the makings of an anti-Soviet, counter-revolutionary party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In their platform, they professed they were all in favour of the policy of industrialization, and even accused the Central Committee of not proceeding with industrialization fast enough, but in reality they did nothing but carp at the Party resolution on the victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R., scoffed at the policy of Socialist industrialization, demanded the surrender of a number of mills and factories to foreigners in the form of concessions, and pinned their main hopes on foreign capitalist concessions in the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In their platform, they professed they were all in favour of the collective-farm movement, and even accused the Central Committee of not proceeding with collectivization fast enough, but in reality they scoffed at the policy of enlisting the peasants in the work of Socialist construction, preached the idea that "unresolvable conflicts" between the working class and the peasantry were inevitable, and pinned their hopes on the "cultured leaseholders" in the countryside, in other words, on the kulaks. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was the most mendacious of all the platforms of the opposition. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was meant to deceive the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Central Committee refused to open a general discussion immediately. It informed the opposition that a general discussion could be opened only in accordance with the Party Rules, namely, two months before a Party congress. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 285</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In October 1927, that is, two months before the Fifteenth Congress, the Central Committee of the Party announced a general Party discussion, and the fight began. Its result was truly lamentable for the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites: 724,000 Party members voted for the policy of the Central Committee; 4,000, or less than one per cent, for the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites. The anti-Party bloc was completely routed. The overwhelming majority of the Party members were unanimous in rejecting the platform of the bloc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Such was the clearly expressed will of the Party, for whose judgment the oppositionists themselves had appealed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But even this lesson was lost on the supporters of the bloc. Instead of submitting to the will of the Party they decided to frustrate it. Even before the discussion had closed, perceiving that ignominious failure awaited them, they decided to resort to more acute forms of struggle against the Party and the Soviet Government and to stage an open demonstration of protest in Moscow and Leningrad. The day they chose for their demonstration was November 7, the anniversary of the October Revolution, the day on which the working people of the U.S.S.R. annually hold their countrywide revolutionary demonstration. Thus, the Trotskyites and Zinovievites planned to hold a parallel demonstration. As was to be expected, the supporters of the bloc managed to bring out into the streets only a miserable handful of their satellites. These satellites and their patrons were overwhelmed by the general demonstration and swept off the streets. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Now there was no longer any doubt that the Trotskyites and Zinovievites had become definitely anti-Soviet. During the general Party discussion they had appealed to the Party against the Central Committee; now, during their puny demonstration, they had taken the course of appealing to the hostile classes against the Party and the Soviet state. Once they had made it their aim to undermine the Bolshevik Party, they were bound to go to the length of undermining the Soviet state, for in the Soviet Union the Bolshevik Party and the state are inseparable. That being the case, the ringleaders of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites had outlawed themselves from the Party, for men who had sunk to the depths of anti-Soviet action could no longer be tolerated in the ranks of the Bolshevik Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On November 14, 1927, a joint meeting of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission expelled Trotsky and Zinoviev from the Party.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
    By the end of 1927 the decisive success of the policy of Socialist industrialization was unmistakable. Under the New Economic Policy industrialization had made considerable progress in a short space of time. The gross output of industry and agriculture (including the timber in dustry and fisheries) had reached and even surpassed the pre-war level. Industrial output had risen to 42 per cent of the total output of the country, which was the pre-war ratio. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Socialist sector of industry was rapidly growing at the expense of the private sector, its output having risen from 81 per cent of the total output in 1924-25 to 86 per cent in 1926-27, the output of the private sector dropping from 19 per cent to 14 per cent in the same period. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This meant that industrialization in the U.S.S.R was of a pronounced Socialist character, that industry was developing towards the victory of the Socialist system of production, and that as far as industry was concerned, the question -- "Who will win?" -- had already been decided in favour of Socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     No less rapid was the displacement of the private dealer in the sphere of trade, his share in the retail market having fallen from 42 per cent in 1924-25 to 32 per cent in 1926-27, not to mention the wholesale market, where the share of the private dealer had fallen from 9 per cent to 5 per cent in the same period. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Even more rapid was the rate of growth of <I>large-scale</I> Socialist industry, which in 1927, the first year <I>after</I> the restoration period, increased its output over the previous year by 18 per cent. This was a record increase, one beyond the reach of the large-scale industry of even the most advanced capitalist countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But in agriculture, especially grain growing, the picture was different. Although agriculture as a whole had passed the pre-war level, the gross yield of its most important branch -- grain growing -- was only 91 per cent of pre-war, while the marketed share of the harvest, that is, the amount of grain sold for the supply of the towns, scarcely attained 37 per cent of the pre-war figure. Furthermore, all the signs pointed to the danger of a further decline in the amount of marketable grain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This meant that the process of the splitting up of the large farms that used to produce for the market, into small farms, and of the small farms 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 287</B></FONT><P>

into dwarf farms, a process which had begun in 1988, was still going on; that these small and dwarf peasant farms were reverting practically to a natural form of economy and were able to supply only a negligible quantity of grain for the market; that while in the 1927 period the grain crop was only slightly below that of the pre-war period, the marketable surplus for the supply of the towns was only a little more than one-third of the pre-war marketable surplus. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    There could be no doubt that if such a state of affairs in grain farming were to continue, the army and the urban population would be faced with chronic famine. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a crisis in grain farming which was bound to be followed by a crisis in livestock farming. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The only escape from this predicament was a change to large-scale farming which would permit the use of tractors and agricultural machines and secure a several-fold increase of the marketable surplus of grain. The country had the alternative: either to adopt large-scale <I>capitalist</I> farming, which would have meant the ruin of the peasant masses, destroyed the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, increased the strength of the kulaks, and led to the downfall of Socialism in the countryside; or to take the course of amalgamating the small peasant holdings into large <I>Socialist</I> farms, collective farms, which would be able to use tractors and other modern machines for a rapid advancement of grain farming and a rapid increase in the marketable surplus of gain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It is clear that the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state could only take the second course, the collective farm way of developing agriculture. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In this, the Party was guided by the following precepts of Lenin regarding the necessity of passing from small peasant farming to large scale, co-operative, collective farming: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      a)&nbsp;"There is no escape from poverty for the small farm." (Lenin,    <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. VIII, p. 195.) 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    b)&nbsp;"If we continue as of old on our small farms, even as free citizens on free land, we shall still be faced with inevitable ruin." (Lenin, <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. VI, p. 370.) 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    c)&nbsp;"If peasant farming is to develop further, we must firmly assure also its transition to the next stage, and this next stage must inevitably be one in which the small, isolated peasant farms, the least profitable and most backward, will by a process of gradual amalgamation form large-scale collective farms." (Lenin, <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. IX, p. 151.) 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 288</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      d)&nbsp;"Only if we succeed in proving to the peasants in practice the advantages of common, collective, co-operative, artel cultivation of the soil, only if we succeed in helping the peasant by means of co-operative or artel farming, will the working class, which holds the state power, be really able to convince the peasant of the correctness of its policy and to secure the real and durable following of the millions of peasants." (Lenin, <I>Selected Works</I>, Vol. VIII, p. 198.)

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such was the situation prior to the Fifteenth Party Congress. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Fifteenth Party Congress opened on December 2, 1927. It was attended by 898 delegates with vote and 771 delegates with voice but no vote, representing 887,233 Party members and 348,957 candidate members. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In his report on behalf of the Central Committee, Comrade Stalin referred to the good results of industrialization and the rapid expansion of Socialist industry, and set the Party the following task: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "To extend and consolidate our Socialist key position in all economic branches in town and country and to pursue a course of eliminating the capitalist elements from the national economy." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Comparing agriculture with industry and noting the backwardness of the former, especially of grain growing, owing to the scattered state of agriculture, which precluded the use of modern machinery, Comrade Stalin emphasized that such an unenviable state of agriculture was endangering the entire national economy.

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
    "What is the way out?" Comrade Stalin asked. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    "The way out," he said, "is to turn the small and scattered peasant farms into large united farms based on the common cultivation of the soil, to introduce collective cultivation of the soil on the basis of a new and higher technique. The way out is to unite the small and dwarf peasant farms gradually but surely, not by pressure, but by example and persuasion, into large farms based on common, co-operative, collective cultivation of the soil with the use of agricultural machines and tractors and scientific methods of intensive agriculture. There is no other way out." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Fifteenth Congress passed a resolution calling for the fullest development of collectivization in agriculture. The congress adopted a plan for the extension and consolidation of the collective farms and state farms and formulated explicit instructions concerning the methods to be used in the struggle for collectivization in agriculture. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 289</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the same time, the congress gave directions:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "To develop further the offensive against the kulaks and to adopt a number of new measures which would restrict the development of capitalism in the countryside and guide peasant farming towards Socialism." (<I>Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.]</I>, Russ. ed., Part II, p. 260.)
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Finally, in view of the fact that economic planning had taken firm root, and with the object of organizing a systematic offensive of Socialism against the capitalist elements along the entire economic front, the congress gave instructions to the proper bodies for the drawing up of the <I>First Five-Year Plan</I> for the development of the national economy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    After passing decisions on the problems of Socialist construction, the congress proceeded to discuss the question of liquidating the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The congress recognized that "the opposition has ideologically broken with Leninism, has degenerated into a Menshevik group, has taken the course of capitulation to the forces of the international and home bourgeoisie, and has objectively become a tool of counter-revolution against the regime of the proletarian dictatorship." (<I>Ibid.</I>, p. 232.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The congress found that the differences between the Party and the opposition had developed into differences of program, and that the Trotsky opposition had taken the course of struggle against the Soviet power. The congress therefore declared that adherence to the Trotsky opposition and the propagation of its views were incompatible with membership of the Bolshevik Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The congress approved the decision of the joint meeting of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission to expel Trotsky and Zinoviev from the Party and resolved on the expulsion of all active members of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites, such as Radek, Preobrazhensky, Rakovsky, Pyatakov, Serebryakov, I. Smirnov, Kamenev, Sarkis, Safarov, Lifshitz, Mdivani, Smilga and the whole "Democratic-Centralism" group (Sapronov, V. Smirnov, Boguslavsky, Drobnis and others). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Defeated ideologically and routed organizationally, the adherents of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites lost the last vestiges of their influence among the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Shortly after the Fifteenth Party Congress, the expelled anti-Leninists began to hand in statements, recanting Trotskyism and asking to be reinstated in the Party. Of course, at that time the Party could not yet know that Trotsky, Rakovsky, Radek, Krestinsky, Sokolnikov  

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 290</B></FONT><P>

and others had long been enemies of the people, spies recruited by foreign espionage services, and that Kamenev, Zinoviev, Pyatakov and others were already forming connections with enemies of the U.S.S.R in capitalist countries for the purpose of "collaboration" with them against the Soviet people. But experience had taught the Party that any knavery might be expected from these individuals, who had often attacked Lenin and the Leninist Party at the most crucial moments. It was therefore sceptical of the statements they had made in their applications for reinstatement. As a preliminary test of their sincerity, it made their reinstatement in the Party dependent on the following conditions: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    a)&nbsp;They must publicly denounce Trotskyism as an anti-Bolshevik and anti-Soviet ideology. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    b)&nbsp;They must publicly acknowledge the Party policy as the only correct policy.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    c)&nbsp;They must unconditionally abide by the decisions of the Party and its bodies. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    d)&nbsp;They must undergo a term of probation, during which the Party would test them; on the expiration of this term, the Party would consider the reinstatement of each applicant separately, depending on the results of the test. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Party considered that in any case the public acceptance of these points by the expelled would be all to the good of the Party, because it would break the unity of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite ranks, undermine their morale, demonstrate once more the right and the might of the Party, and enable the Party, if the applicants were sincere, to reinstate its former workers in its ranks, and if they were not sincere, to unmask them in the public eye, no longer as misguided individuals, but as unprincipled careerists, deceivers of the working class and incorrigible double-dealers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The majority of the expelled accepted the terms of reinstatement and made public statements in the press to this effect. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Desiring to be clement to them, and loath to deny them an opportunity of once again becoming men of the Party and of the working class, the Party reinstated them in its ranks. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    However, time showed that, with few exceptions, the recantations of the "leading lights" of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites were false and hypocritical from beginning to end. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It turned out that even before they had handed in their applications, these gentry had ceased to represent a political trend ready to defend their views before the people, and had become an unprincipled gang of careerists who were prepared publicly to trample on the last remnants

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 291</B></FONT><P>

of their own views, publicly to praise the views of the Party, which were alien to them, and -- like chameleons -- to adopt any colouring, provided they could maintain themselves in the ranks of the Party and the working class and have the opportunity to do harm to the working class and to its Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The "leading lights" of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites proved to be political swindlers, political double-dealers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Political double-dealers usually begin with deceit and prosecute their nefarious ends by deceiving the people, the working class, and the Party of the working class. But political double-dealers are not to be regarded as mere humbugs. Political double-dealers are an unprincipled gang of political careerists who, having long ago lost the confidence of the people, strive to insinuate themselves once more into their confidence by deception, by chameleon-like changes of colour, by fraud, by any means, only that they might retain the title of political figures. Political double-dealers are an unprincipled gang of political careerists who are ready to seek support anywhere, even among criminal elements, even among the scum of society, even among the mortal enemies of the people, only that they might be able, at a "propitious" moment, again to mount the political stage and to clamber on to the back of the people as their "rulers." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The "leading lights" of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites were political double-dealers of this very description.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The agitation conducted by the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites against the Party policy, against the building of Socialism, and against collectivization, as well as the agitation conducted by the Bukharinites, who said that nothing would come of the collective farms, that the kulaks should be let alone because they would "grow" into Socialism of themselves, and that the enrichment of the bourgeoisie represented no danger to Socialism -- all found an eager response among the capitalist elements in the country, and above all among the kulaks. The kulaks now knew from comments in the press that they were not alone, that they had defenders and intercessors in the persons of Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Rykov and others. Naturally, this could not but stiffen the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 292</B></FONT><P>

kulaks' spirit of resistance against the policy of the Soviet Government. And, in fact, the resistance of the kulaks became increasingly stubborn. They refused en masse to sell to the Soviet state their grain surpluses, of which they had considerable hoards. They resorted to terrorism against the collective farmers, against Party workers and government officials in the countryside, and burned down collective farms and state granaries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Party realized that until the resistance of the kulaks was broken, until they were defeated in open fight in full view of the peasantry, the working class and the Red Army would suffer from a food shortage, and the movement for collectivization among the peasants could not assume a mass character. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In pursuance of the instructions of the Fifteenth Party Congress, the Party launched a determined offensive against the kulaks, putting into effect the slogan: rely firmly on the poor peasantry, strengthen the alliance with the middle peasantry, and wage a resolute struggle against the kulaks. In answer to the kulaks' refusal to sell their grain surpluses to the state at the fixed prices, the Party and the Government adopted a number of emergency measures against the kulaks, applied Article 107 of the Criminal Code empowering the courts to confiscate grain surpluses from kulaks and profiteers in case they refused to sell them to the state at the fixed prices, and granted the poor peasants a number of privileges, under which 25 per cent of the confiscated kulak grain was placed at their disposal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These emergency measures had their effect: the poor and middle peasants joined in the resolute fight against the kulaks; the kulaks were isolated, and the resistance of the kulaks and the profiteers was broken. By the end of 1928, the Soviet state already had sufficient stocks of grain at its disposal, and the collective-farm movement began to advance with surer strides. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    That same year, a large organization of wreckers, consisting of bourgeois experts, was discovered in the Shakhty district of the Donetz Coal Basin. The Shakhty wreckers were closely connected with the former mine owners -- Russian and foreign capitalists -- and with a foreign military espionage service. Their aim was to disrupt the development of Socialist industry and to facilitate the restoration of capitalism in the U.S.S.R. The wreckers had deliberately mismanaged the mines in order to reduce the output of coal, spoiled machinery and ventilation apparatus, caused roof-falls and explosions, and set fire to pits, plants and power stations. The wreckers had deliberately obstructed the improvement of the workers' conditions and had infringed the Soviet labour protection laws. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 293</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The wreckers were put on trial and met with their deserts. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Central Committee of the Party directed all Party organizations to draw the necessary conclusions from the Shakhty case. Comrade Stalin declared that Bolshevik business executives must themselves become experts in the technique of production, so as no longer to be the dupes of the wreckers among the old bourgeois experts, and that the training of new technical personnel from the ranks of the working class must be accelerated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In accordance with a decision of the Central Committee, the training of young experts in the technical colleges was improved. Thousands of Party members, members of the Young Communist League and non-Party people devoted to the cause of the working class were mobilized for study. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Before the Party took the offensive against the kulaks, and while it was engaged in liquidating the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites, the Bukharin-Rykov group had been more or less lying low, holding themselves as a reserve of the anti-Party forces, not venturing to support the Trotskyites openly, and sometimes even acting together with the Party against the Trotskyites. But when the Party assumed the offensive against the kulaks, and adopted emergency measures against them, the Bukharin-Rykov group threw off their mask and began to attack the Party policy openly. The kulak soul of the Bukharin-Rykov group got the better of them, and they began to come out openly in defence of the kulaks. They demanded the repeal of the emergency measures, frightening the simple-minded with the argument that otherwise agriculture would begin to "decay," and even affirming that this process had already begun. Blind to the growth of the collective farms and state farms, those superior forms of agricultural organization, and perceiving the decline of kulak farming, they represented the decay of the latter as the decay of agriculture. In order to provide a theoretical backing for their case, they concocted the absurd "theory of the subsidence of the class-struggle," maintaining, on the strength of this theory, that the class struggle would grow milder with every victory gained by Socialism against the capitalist elements, that the class struggle would soon subside altogether and the class enemy would surrender all his positions without a fight, and that, consequently, there was no need for an offensive against the kulaks. In this way they tried to furbish up their threadbare bourgeois theory that the kulaks would peaceably grow into Socialism, and rode roughshod over the well-known thesis of Leninism that the resistance of the class enemy would assume more acute forms as the progress of Socialism cut the ground from under his feet 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 294</B></FONT><P>

and that the class struggle could "subside" only after the class enemy was destroyed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was easy to see that in the Bukharin-Rykov group the Party was faced with a group of Right opportunists who differed from the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites only in form, only in the fact that the Trotskyite and Zinovievite capitulators had had some opportunity of masking their true nature with Left, revolutionary vociferations about "permanent revolution," whereas the Bukharin-Rykov group, attacking the Party as they did for taking the offensive against the kulaks, could not possibly mask their capitulatory character and had to defend the reactionary forces in our country, the kulaks in particular, openly, without mask or disguise. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Party understood that sooner or later the Bukharin-Rykov group was bound to join hands with the remnants of the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites for common action against the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Parallel with their political pronouncements, the Bukharin-Rykov group "worked" to muster and organize their following. Through Bukharin, they banded together young bourgeois elements like Slepkov, Maretsky, Eichenwald, Goldenberg; through Tomsky -- high bureaucrats in the trade unions (Melnichansky, Dogadov and others); through Rykov -- demoralized high Soviet officials (A. Smirnov, Eismont, V. Schmidt, and others). The group readily attracted people who had degenerated politically, and who made no secret of their capitulatory sentiments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     About this time the Bukharin-Rykov group gained the support of high functionaries in the Moscow Party organization (Uglanov, Kotov, Ukhanov, Ryutin, Yagoda, Polonsky, and others). A section of the Rights kept under cover, abstaining from open attacks on the Party line. In the Moscow Party press and at Party meetings, it was advocated that concessions must be made to the kulaks, that heavy taxation of kulaks was inadvisable, that industrialization was burdensome to the people, and that the development of heavy industry was premature. Uglanov opposed the Dnieper hydro-electric scheme and demanded that funds be diverted from heavy industry to the light industries. Uglanov and the other Right capitulators maintained that Moscow was and would remain a gingham city, and that there was no need to build engineering works in Moscow. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Moscow Party organization unmasked Uglanov and his followers, gave them a final warning and rallied closer than ever around the Central Committee of the Party. At a plenary meeting of the Moscow Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.), held in 1928, Comrade Stalin said 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 295</B></FONT><P>

that a fight must be waged on two fronts, with the fire concentrated on the Right deviation. The Rights, Comrade Stalin said, were kulak agents inside the Party. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The triumph of the Right deviation in our Party would unleash the forces of capitalism, undermine the revolutionary position of the proletariat and increase the chances of restoring capitalism in our country," said Comrade Stalin. (Stalin, <I>Leninism</I>, Vol. II.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the beginning of 1929 it was discovered that Bukharin, authorized by the group of Right capitulators, had formed connections with the Trotskyites, through Kamenev, and was negotiating an agreement with them for a joint struggle against the Party. The Central Committee exposed these criminal activities of the Right capitulators and warned them that this affair might end lamentably for Bukharin, Rykov, Tomsky and the rest. But the Right capitulators would not heed the warning. At a meeting of the Central Committee they advanced a new anti-Party platform, in the form of a declaration, which the Central Committee condemned. It warned them again, reminding them of what had happened to the bloc of Trotskyites and Zinovievites. In spite of this, the Bukharin-Rykov group persisted in their anti-Party activities. Rykov, Tomsky and Bukharin tendered to the Central Committee their resignations, believing that they would intimidate the Party thereby. The Central Committee passed condemnation on this saboteur policy of resignations. Finally, a plenum of the Central Committee, held in November 1929, declared that the propaganda of the views of the Right opportunists was incompatible with membership of the Party; it resolved that Bukharin, as the instigator and leader of the Right capitulators, be removed from the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and issued a grave warning to Rykov, Tomsky and other members of the Right opposition. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Perceiving that matters had taken a lamentable turn, the chieftains of the Right capitulators submitted a statement acknowledging their errors and the correctness of the political line of the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Right capitulators decided to effect a temporary retreat so as to preserve their ranks from debacle. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This ended the first stage of the Party's fight against the Right capitulators. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The new differences within the Party did not escape the attention of the external enemies of the Soviet Union. Believing that the "new dissensions" in the Party were a sign of its weakness, they made a new attempt to involve the U.S.S.R. in war and to thwart the work of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 296</B></FONT><P>

industrialization before it had got properly under way. In the summer of 1929, the imperialists provoked a conflict between China and the Soviet Union, and instigated the seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway (which belonged to the U.S.S.R.) by the Chinese militarists, and an attack on our Far-Eastern frontier by troops of the Chinese Whites. But this raid of the Chinese militarists was promptly liquidated, the militarists, routed by the Red Army, retreated and the conflict ended in the signing of a peace agreement with the Manchurian authorities. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The peace policy of the U.S.S.R. once more triumphed in the face of all obstacles, notwithstanding the intrigues of external enemies and the "dissensions" within the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Soon after this diplomatic and trade relations between the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain, which had been severed by the British Conservatives, were resumed. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    While successfully repulsing the attacks of the external and internal enemies, the Party was busily engaged in developing heavy industry, organizing Socialist emulation, building up state farms and collective farms, and, lastly, preparing the ground for the adoption and execution of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In April 1929, the Party held its Sixteenth Conference, with the First Five-Year Plan as the main tem on the agenda. The conference rejected the "minimal" variant of the Five-Year Plan advocated by the Right capitulators and adopted the "optimal" variant as binding under all circumstances. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Thus, the Party adopted the celebrated First Five-Year Plan for the construction of Socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Five-Year-Plan fixed the volume of capital investments in the national economy in the period 1928-33 at 64,600,000,000 rubles. Of this sum, 19,500,000,000 rubles were to be invested in industrial and electric-power development, 10,000,000,000 rubles in transport development and 23,200,000,000 rubles in agriculture. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a colossal plan for the equipment of industry and agriculture of the U.S.S.R. with modern technique. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The fundamental task of the Five-Year Plan," said Comrade Stalin, "was to create such an industry in our country as would be able to re-equip and reorganize, not only the whole of industry, but also transport and agriculture -- on the basis of Socialism." (Stalin, <I>Problems of Leninism</I>, Russ. ed., p. 485.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For all the immensity of this plan, it did not nonplus or surprise the Bolsheviks. The way for it had been prepared by the whole course of

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 297</B></FONT><P>

development of industrialization and collectivization and it had been preceded by a wave of labour enthusiasm which caught up the workers and peasants and which found expression in <I>Socialist emulation.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Sixteenth Party Conference adopted an appeal to all working people, calling for the further development of Socialist emulation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Socialist emulation had produced many an instance of exemplary labour and of a new attitude to labour. In many factories, collective farms and state farms, the workers and collective farmers drew up <I>counter-plans</I> for an output exceeding that provided for in the state plans. They displayed heroism in labour. They not only fulfilled, but exceeded the plans of Socialist development laid down by the Party and the Government. The attitude to labour had changed. From the involuntary and penal servitude it had been under capitalism, it was becoming "a matter of honour, a matter of glory, a matter of valour and heroism." (<I>Stalin.</I>) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     New industrial construction on a gigantic scale was in progress all over the country. The Dnieper hydro-electric scheme was in full swing. Construction work on the Kramatorsk and Gorlovka Iron and Steel Works and the reconstruction of the Lugansk Locomotive Works had begun in the Donetz Basin. New collieries and blast furnaces came into being. The Urals Machine-Building Works and the Berezniki and Solikamsk Chemical Works were under construction in the Urals. Work was begun on the construction of the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk. The erection of big automobile plants in Moscow and Gorky was well under way, as was the construction of giant tractor plants, harvester combine plants, and a mammoth agricultural machinery plant in Rostov-on-Don. The Kuznetsk collieries, the Soviet Union's second coal base, were being extended. An immense tractor works sprang up in the steppe near Stalingrad in the space of eleven months. In the erection of the Dnieper Hydro-Electric Station and the Stalingrad Tractor Works, the workers beat world records in productivity of labour. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     History had never known industrial construction on such a gigantic scale, such enthusiasm for new development, such labour heroism on the part of the working-class millions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was a veritable upsurge of labour enthusiasm, produced and stimulated by Socialist emulation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This time the peasants did not lag behind the workers. In the countryside, too, this labour enthusiasm began to spread among the peasant masses who were organizing their collective farms. The peasants definitely began to turn to collective farming. In this a great part was played by the state farms and the machine and tractor stations. The 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 298</B></FONT><P>

peasants would come in crowds to the state farms and machine and tractor stations to watch the operation of the tractors and other agricultural machines, admire their performance and there and then resolve: "Let's join the collective farm." Divided and disunited, each on his tiny, dwarf individually-run farm, destitute of anything like serviceable implements or traction, having no way of breaking up large tracts of virgin soil, without prospect of any improvement on their farms, crushed by poverty, isolated and left to their own devices, the peasants had at last found a way out, an avenue to a better life, in the amalgamation of their small farms into co-operative undertakings, collective farms; in tractors, which are able to break up any "hard ground," any virgin soil; in the assistance rendered by the state in the form of machines, money, men, and counsel; in the opportunity to free themselves from bondage to the kulaks, who had been quite recently defeated by the Soviet Government and forced to the ground, to the joy of the millions of peasants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    On this basis began the mass collective-farm movement, which later developed rapidly, especially towards the end of 1929, progressing at an unprecedented rate, a rate unknown even to our Socialist industry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In 1928 the total crop area of the collective farms was 1,390,000 hectares, in 1929 it was 4,262,000 hectares, while in 1930 the ploughing plan of the collective farms was already 15,000,000 hectares. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It must be admitted," said Comrade Stalin in his article, "<A HREF="../Stalin/YGC29.html">A Year of Great Change</A>" (1929), in reference to the collective farms, "that such an impetuous speed of development is unequalled even in our socialized large-scale industry, which in general is noted for its outstanding speed of development."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This was a turning point in the development of the collective-farm movement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was the beginning of a mass collective-farm movement.


<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "What is the <I>new</I> feature of the present collective-farm movement?" asked Comrade Stalin in his article, "A Year of Great Change." And he answered: 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "The new and decisive feature of the present collective-farm movement is that the peasants are joining the collective farms not in separate groups, as was formerly the case, but in whole villages, whole <I>volosts</I> (rural districts), whole districts and even whole areas. And what does that mean? It means that <I>the middle peasant has joined the collective-farm movement.</I> And that is the basis of that radical change in the development of agriculture which represents the most important achievement of the Soviet Government. . . ."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This meant that the time was becoming ripe, or had already become ripe, for the elimination of the kulaks as a class, on the basis of solid collectivization.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    During the period 1926-29, the Party grappled with and overcame immense difficulties on the home and foreign fronts in the fight for the Socialist industrialization of the country. The efforts of the Party and the working class ended in the victory of the policy of Socialist industrialization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the main, one of the most difficult problems of industrialization had been solved, namely, the problem of accumulating funds for the building of a heavy industry. The foundations were laid of a heavy industry capable of re-equipping the entire national economy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The First Five-Year Plan of Socialist construction was adopted. The building of new factories, state farms and collective farms was developed on a vast scale. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This advance towards Socialism was attended by a sharpening of the class struggle in the country and a sharpening of the struggle within the Party. The chief results of this struggle were that the resistance of the kulaks was crushed, the bloc of Trotskyite and Zinovievite capitulators was exposed as an anti-Soviet bloc, the Right capitulators were exposed as agents of the kulaks, the Trotskyites were expelled from the Party, and the views of the Trotskyites and the Right opportunists were declared incompatible with membership of the C.P.S.U.(B.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Defeated ideologically by the Bolshevik Party, and having lost all support among the working class, the Trotskyites ceased to be a political trend and became an unprincipled, careerist clique of political swindlers, a gang of political double-dealers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Having laid the foundations of a heavy industry, the Party mustered the working class and the peasantry for the fulfilment of the First Five-Year Plan for the Socialist reconstruction of the U.S.S.R. Socialist emulation developed all over the country among millions of working people, giving rise to a mighty wave of labour enthusiasm and originating a new labour discipline. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This period ended with a year of great change, signalized by sweeping victories of Socialism in industry, the first important successes in agriculture, the swing of the middle peasant towards the collective farms, and the beginning of a mass collective-farm movement.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   While in the U.S.S.R. important progress had been made in the Socialist industrialization of the country and industry was rapidly developing, in the capitalist countries a devastating world economic crisis of unprecedented dimensions had broken out at the end of 1929 and grew steadily more acute in the three following years. The industrial crisis was interwoven with an agrarian crisis, which made matters still worse for the capitalist countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In the three years of economic crisis (1930-33), industrial output in the U.S.A. had sunk to 65 per cent, in Great Britain to 86 per cent, in Germany to 66 per cent and in France to 77 per cent of the 1929 output. Yet in this same period industrial output in the U.S.S.R. more than doubled, amounting in 1933 to 201 per cent of the 1929 output. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was but an additional proof of the superiority of the Socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. It showed that the country of Socialism is the only country in the world which is exempt from economic crises. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The world economic crisis condemned 24,000,000 unemployed to starvation, poverty and misery. The agrarian crisis brought suffering to tens of millions of peasants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The world economic crisis further aggravated the contradictions between the imperialist states, between the victor countries and the vanquished countries, between the imperialist states and the colonial and dependent countries, between the workers and the capitalists, between the peasants and the landlords. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In his report on behalf of the Central Committee to the Sixteenth Party Congress, Comrade Stalin pointed out that the bourgeoisie would seek a way out of the economic crisis, on the one hand, by crushing the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 301</B></FONT><P>

working class through the establishment of fascist dictatorship, <I>i.e.</I>, the dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, most imperialistic capitalist elements, and, on the other hand, by fomenting war for the redivision of colonies and spheres of influence at the expense of the poorly defended countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   That is just what happened. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In 1932 the war danger was aggravated by Japan. Perceiving that, owing to the economic crisis, the European powers and the U.S.A. were wholly engrossed in their domestic affairs, the Japanese imperialists decided to seize the opportunity and bring pressure to bear on poorly defended China, in an attempt to subjugate her and to lord it over the country. Unscrupulously exploiting "local incidents" they themselves had provoked, the Japanese imperialists, like robbers, without declaring war on China, marched their troops into Manchuria. The Japanese soldiery seized the whole of Manchuria, thereby preparing a convenient <I>place d'armes</I> for the conquest of North China and for an attack on the U.S.S.R. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in order to leave her hands free, and began to arm at a feverish pace. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This impelled the U.S.A., Britain and France to strengthen their naval armaments in the Far East. It was obvious that Japan was out to subjugate China and to eject the European and American imperialist powers from that country. They replied by increasing their armaments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But Japan was pursuing another purpose, too, namely, to seize the Soviet Far East. Naturally, the U.S.S.R. could not shut its eyes to this danger, and began intensively to strengthen the defences of its Far Eastern territory. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Thus, in the Far East, thanks to the Japanese fascist imperialists, there arose the first seat of war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But it was not only in the Far East that the economic crisis aggravated the contradictions of capitalism. It aggravated them in Europe too. The prolonged crisis in industry and agriculture, the huge volume of unemployment, and the growing insecurity of the poorer classes fanned the discontent of the workers and peasants. The discontent of the working class grew into revolutionary disaffection. This was particularly the case in Germany, which was economically exhausted by the war, by the payment of reparations to the Anglo-French victors, and by the economic crisis, and the working class of which languished under a double yoke, that of the home and the foreign, the British and French, bourgeoisie. The extent of this discontent was clearly indicated by the six million votes cast for the German Communist Party at the last Reichstag elections, before the fascists came to power. The German 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 302</B></FONT><P>

bourgeoisie perceived that the bourgeois-democratic liberties preserved in Germany might play them an evil trick, that the working class might use these liberties to extend the revolutionary movement. They therefore decided that there was only one way of maintaining the power of the bourgeoisie in Germany, and that was to abolish the bourgeois liberties, to reduce the Reichstag to a cipher, and to establish a terrorist bourgeois-nationalist dictatorship, which would be able to suppress the working class and base itself on the petty-bourgeois masses who wanted to revenge Germany's defeat in the war. And so they called to power the fascist party -- which in order to hoodwink the people calls itself the National-<I>Socialist</I> Party -- well knowing that the fascist party, first, represents that section of the imperialist bourgeoisie which is the most reactionary and most hostile to the working class, and, secondly, that it is the most pronounced party of revenge, one capable of beguiling the millions of the nationalistically minded petty bourgeoisie. In this they were assisted by the traitors to the working class, the leaders of the German Social-Democratic Party, who paved the way for fascism by their policy of compromise. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These were the conditions which brought about the accession to power of the German fascists in 1933. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Analysing the events in Germany in his report to the Seventeenth Party Congress, Comrade Stalin said: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The victory of fascism in Germany must be regarded not only as a symptom of the weakness of the working class and a result of the betrayals of the working class by the Social-Democratic Party, which paved the way for fascism; it must also be regarded as a symptom of the weakness of the bourgeoisie, of the fact that the bourgeoisie is already unable to rule by the old methods of parliamentarism and bourgeois democracy, and, as a consequence, is compelled in its home policy to resort to terroristic methods of rule. . . ." (J. Stalin, <I>Seventeenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.</I>, "Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.[B.]," p. 17.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The German fascists inaugurated their home policy by setting fire to the Reichstag, brutally suppressing the working class, destroying its organizations, and abolishing the bourgeois-democratic liberties. They inaugurated their foreign policy by withdrawing from the League of Nations and openly preparing for a war for the <I>forcible</I> revision of the frontiers of the European states to the advantage of Germany. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, in the centre of Europe, thanks to the German fascists, there arose a second seat of war. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 303</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Naturally, the U.S.S.R. could not shut its eyes to so serious a fact, and began to keep a sharp watch on the course of events in the West and to strengthen its defences on the Western frontiers.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The mass influx of the peasants into the collective farms in 1929 and 1930 was a result of the whole preceding work of the Party and the Government. The growth of Socialist industry, which had begun the mass production of tractors and machines for agriculture; the vigorous measures taken against the kulaks during the grain-purchasing campaigns of 1928 and 1929; the spread of agricultural co-operative societies, which gradually accustomed the peasants to collective farming; the good results obtained by the first collective farms and state farms -- all this prepared the way for solid collectivization, when the peasants of entire villages, districts and regions joined the collective farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Solid collectivization was not just a peaceful process -- the overwhelming bulk of the peasantry simply joining the collective farms -- but was a struggle of the peasant masses against the kulaks. Solid collectivization meant that all the land in a village area in which a collective farm was formed passed into the hands of the collective farm; but a considerable portion of this land was held by the kulaks, and therefore the peasants would expropriate them, driving them from the land, dispossessing them of their cattle and machinery and demanding their arrest and eviction from the district by the Soviet authorities. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Solid collectivization therefore meant the elimination of the kulaks. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was a policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class, on the basis of solid collectivization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     By this time, the U.S.S.R. had a strong enough material base to allow it to put an end to the kulaks, break their resistance, eliminate them as a class and replace kulak farming by collective and state farming. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In 1927 the kulaks still produced over 600,000,000 poods of grain, of which about 130,000,000 poods were available for sale. In that year the collective and state farms had only 35,000,000 poods of grain available for sale. In 1929, thanks to the Bolshevik Party's firm policy 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 304</B></FONT><P>

of developing state farms and collective farms, and likewise to the progress made by Socialist industry in supplying the countryside with tractors and agricultural machinery, the collective farms and state farms had become an important factor. In that year the collective farms and state farms already produced no less than 400,000,000 poods of grain, of which over 130,000,000 poods were marketed. This was more than the kulaks had marketed in 1927. And in 1930 the collective farms and state farms were to produce, and actually did produce, over 400,000,000 poods of grain for the market, which was incomparably more than had been marketed by the kulaks in 1927. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Thus, thanks to the changed alignment of class forces in the economic life of the country, and the existence of the necessary material base for the replacement of the kulak grain output by that of the collective and state farms, the Bolshevik Party was able to proceed from the policy of <I>restricting</I> the kulaks to a new policy, the policy of <I>eliminating them as a class</I>, on the basis of solid collectivization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Prior to 1929, the Soviet Government had pursued a policy of restricting the kulaks. It had imposed higher taxes on the kulak, and had required him to sell grain to the state at fixed prices; by the law on the renting of land it had to a certain extent restricted the amount of land he could use; by the law on the employment of hired labour on private farms it had limited the scope of his farm. But it had not yet pursued a policy of eliminating the kulaks, since the laws on the renting of land and the hiring of labour allowed them to carry on, while the prohibition of their expropriation gave them a certain guarantee in this respect. The effect of this policy was to arrest the growth of the kulak class, some sections of which, unable to withstand the pressure of these restrictions, were forced out of business and ruined. But this policy did not destroy the economic foundations of the kulaks as a class, nor did it tend to eliminate them. It was a policy of restricting the kulaks, not of eliminating them. This policy was essential up to a certain time, that is, as long as the collective farms and state farms were still weak and unable to replace the kulaks in the production of grain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    At the end of 1929, with the growth of the collective farms and state farms, the Soviet Government turned sharply from this policy to the policy of eliminating the kulaks, of destroying them as a class. It repealed the laws on the renting of land and the hiring of labour, thus, depriving the kulaks both of land and of hired labourers. It lifted the ban on the expropriation of the kulaks. It permitted the peasants to confiscate cattle, machines and other farm property from the kulaks for the benefit of the collective farms. The kulaks were expropriated. They were expro-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 305</B></FONT><P>

priated just as the capitalists had been expropriated in the sphere of industry in 1918, with this difference, however, that the kulaks' means of production did not pass into the hands of the state, but into the hands of the peasants united in the collective farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a profound revolution, a leap from an old qualitative state of society to a new qualitative state, equivalent in its consequences to the revolution of October 1917. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The distinguishing feature of this revolution is that it was accomplished <I>from above</I>, on the initiative of the state, and directly supported <I>from below</I> by the millions of peasants, who were fighting to throw off kulak bondage and to live in freedom in the collective farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This revolution, at one blow, solved three fundamental problems of Socialist construction: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    a)&nbsp;It eliminated the most numerous class of exploiters in our country, the kulak class, the mainstay of capitalist restoration; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    b)&nbsp;It transferred the most numerous labouring class in our country, the peasant class, from the path of individual farming, which breeds capitalism, to the path of co-operative, collective, Socialist farming; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    c)&nbsp;It furnished the Soviet regime with a Socialist base in agriculture -- the most extensive and vitally necessary, yet least developed, branch of national economy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This destroyed the last mainsprings of the restoration of capitalism within the country and at the same time created new and decisive conditions for the building up of a Socialist economic system. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Explaining the reasons for the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class, and summing up the results of the mass movement of the peasants for solid collectivization, Comrade Stalin wrote in 1929: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The last hope of the capitalists of all countries, who are dreaming of restoring capitalism in the U.S.S.R. -- 'the sacred principle of private property' -- is collapsing and vanishing. The peasants, whom they regarded as material manuring the soil for capitalism, are abandoning en masse the lauded banner of 'private property' and are taking to the path of collectivism, the path of Socialism. The last hope for the restoration of capitalism is crumbling." (Stalin, <I>Leninism</I>, Vol. II, "<A HREF="../Stalin/YGC29.html">A Year of Great Change</A>.") 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class was embodied in the historic resolution on "The Rate of Collectivization and State Measures to Assist the Development of Collective Farms" adopted by the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) on January 5, 1930. In this decision, full account was taken of the diversity of conditions in the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 306</B></FONT><P>

various districts of the U.S.S.R. and the varying degrees to which the regions were ripe for collectivization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Different rates of collectivization were established, for which purpose the Central Committee of the C.PS.U.(B.) divided the regions of the U.S.S.R. into three groups. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The first group included the principal grain-growing areas: <I>viz.</I>, the North Caucasus (the Kuban, Don and Terek), the Middle Volga and the Lower Volga, which were ripest for collectivization since they had the most tractors, the most state farms, and the most experience in fighting the kulaks, gained in past grain-purchasing campaigns. The Central Committee proposed that in this group of grain-growing areas collectivization should in the main be completed in the spring of 1931. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The second group of grain-growing areas, the Ukraine, the Central Black-Earth Region, Siberia, the Urals, Kazakhstan and others could complete collectivization in the main in the spring of 1932.  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The other regions, territories and republics (Moscow Region, Transcaucasia, the republics of Central Asia, etc.) could extend the process of collectivization to the end of the Five-Year Plan, that is, to 1933. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In view of the growing speed of collectivization, the Central Committee of the Party considered it necessary to accelerate the construction of plants for the production of tractors, harvester combines, tractor-drawn machinery, etc. Simultaneously, the Central Committee demanded that "the tendency to underestimate the importance of horse traction at the present stage of the collective-farm movement, a tendency which was leading to the reckless disposal and sale of horses, be resolutely checked." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    State loans to collective farms for the year 1929-30 were doubled (500,000,000 rubles) as compared with the original plan. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The expense of the surveying and demarcation of the lands of the collective farms was to be borne by the state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The resolution contained the highly important direction that the <I>chief form</I> of the collective-farm movement at the given stage must be the agricultural artel, in which only the <I>principal</I> means of production are collectivized. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Central Committee most seriously warned Party organizations "against any attempts whatsoever to force the collective-farm movement by 'decrees' from above, which might involve the danger of the substitution of mock-collectivization for real Socialist emulation in the organization of collective farms." (<I>Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.]</I>, Russ. ed., Part II, page 662.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In this resolution the Central Committee made it clear how the Party's new policy in the countryside should be applied. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 307</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class and of solid collectivization stimulated a powerful collective-farm movement. The peasants of whole villages and districts joined the collective farms, sweeping the kulaks from their path and freeing themselves from kulak bondage. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But with all the phenomenal progress of collectivization, certain faults on the part of Party workers, distortions of the Party policy in collective farm development, soon revealed themselves. Although the Central Committee had warned Party workers not to be carried away by the success of collectivization, many of them began to force the pace of collectivization artificially, without regard to the conditions of time and place, and heedless of the degree of readiness of the peasants to join the collective farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It was found that the <I>voluntary</I> principle of forming collective farms was being violated, and that in a number of districts the peasants were being <I>forced</I> into the collective farms under threat of being dispossessed, disfranchised, and so on. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In a number of districts, preparatory work and patient explanation of the underlying principles of the Party's policy with regard to collectivization were being replaced by bureaucratic decreeing from above, by exaggerated, fictitious figures regarding the formation of collective farms, by an artificial inflation of the percentage of collectivization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Although the Central Committee had specified that the chief form of the collective-farm movement must be the agricultural artel, in which only the <I>principal</I> means of production are collectivized, in a number of places pigheaded attempts were made to skip the artel form and pass straight to the commune; dwellings, milch-cows, small livestock, poultry, etc., not exploited for the market, were collectivized. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Carried away by the initial success of collectivization, persons in authority in certain regions violated the Central Committee's explicit instructions regarding the pace and time limits of collectivization. In their zeal for inflated figures, the leadership of the Moscow Region gave the cue to their subordinates to complete collectivization by the spring of 1930, although they had no less than three years (till the end of 1932) for this purpose. Even grosser were the violations in Transcaucasia and Central Asia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Taking advantage of these distortions of policy for their own provocative ends, the kulaks and their toadies would themselves propose that communes be formed instead of agricultural artels, and that dwellings, small livestock and poultry be collectivized forthwith. Furthermore, the kulaks instigated the peasants to slaughter their animals before entering the collective farms, arguing that "they will be taken away anyhow." 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 308</B></FONT><P>

The class enemy calculated that the distortions and mistakes committed by the local organizations in the process of collectivization would incense the peasantry and provoke revolts against the Soviet Government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As a result of the mistakes of Party organizations and the downright provocateur actions of the class enemy, in the latter half of February 1930, against the general background of the unquestionable success of collectivization, there were dangerous signs of serious discontent among the peasantry in a number of districts. Here and there, the kulaks and their agents even succeeded in inciting the peasants to outright anti-Soviet actions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Having received a number of alarming signals of distortions of the Party line that might jeopardize collectivization, the Central Committee of the Party immediately proceeded to remedy the situation, to set the Party workers the task of rectifying the mistakes as quickly as possible. On March 2, 1930, by decision of the Central Committee, Comrade Stalin's article, "<A HREF="../Stalin/DS30.html">Dizzy With Success</A>," was published. This article was a warning to all who had been so carried away by the success of collectivization as to commit gross mistakes and depart from the Party line, to all who were trying to coerce the peasants to join the collective farms. The article laid the utmost emphasis on the principle that the formation of collective farms must be voluntary, and on the necessity of making allowances for the diversity of conditions in the various districts of the U.S.S.R. when determining the pace and methods of collectivization. Comrade Stalin reiterated that the chief form of the collective-farm movement was the agricultural artel, in which only the principal means of production, chiefly those used in grain growing, are collectivized, while household land, dwellings, part of the dairy cattle, small livestock, poultry, etc., are not collectivized. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Comrade Stalin's article was of the utmost political moment. It helped the Party organizations to rectify their mistakes and dealt a severe blow to the enemies of the Soviet Government who had been hoping to take advantage of the distortions of policy to set the peasants against the Soviet Government. The broad mass of the peasants now saw that the line of the Bolshevik Party had nothing in common with the pigheaded "Left" distortions of local authorities. The article set the minds of the peasants at rest. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In order to complete the work begun by Comrade Stalin's article in rectifying distortions and mistakes, the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U (B.) decided to strike another blow at them, and on March 15, 1930, published its resolution on "Measures to Combat the Distortions of the Party Line in the Collective-Farm Movement." 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 309</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This resolution made a detailed analysis of the mistakes committed, showing that they were the result of a departure from the Leninist-Stalinist line of the Party, the result of a flagrant breach of Party instructions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Central Committee pointed out that these "Left" distortions were of direct service to the class enemy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Central Committee gave directions that "persons who are unable or unwilling earnestly to combat distortions of the Party line must be <I>removed</I> from their posts and <I>replaced.</I>" (<I>Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.]</I>, Part II, p. 663.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Central Committee changed the leadership of certain regional and territorial Party organizations (Moscow Region, Transcaucasia) which had committed political mistakes and proved incapable of rectifying them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On April 3, 1930, Comrade Stalin's "<A HREF="../Stalin/RCFC30.html">Reply to Collective Farm Comrades</A>" was published, in which he indicated the <I>root cause</I> of the mistakes in the peasant question and the major mistakes committed in the collective-farm movement, <I>viz.</I>, an incorrect approach to the middle peasant, violation of the Leninist principle that the formation of collective farms must be voluntary, violation of the Leninist principle that allowance must be made for the diversity of conditions in the various districts of the U.S.S.R., and the attempts to skip the artel form and to pass straight to the commune. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The result of all these measures was that the Party secured the correction of the distortions of policy committed by local Party workers in a number of districts. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It required the utmost firmness on the part of the Central Committee and its ability to go <I>against the current</I> in order to promptly correct that considerable body of Party workers who, carried away by success, had been rapidly straying from the Party line. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Party succeeded in correcting the distortions of the Party line in the collective-farm movement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This made it possible to consolidate the success of the collective farm movement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It also made possible a new and powerful advance of the collective farm movement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Prior to the Party's adoption of the policy of eliminating the kulaks as a class, an energetic offensive against the capitalist elements with the object of eliminating them had been waged chiefly in the towns, on the industrial front. So far, the countryside, agriculture, had been lagging behind the towns, behind industry. Consequently, the offensive had not 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 310</B></FONT><P>

borne an all-round, complete and general character. But now that the backwardness of the countryside was becoming a thing of the past, now that the peasants' fight for the elimination of the kulak class had taken clear shape, and the Party had adopted the policy of eliminating the kulak class, the offensive against the capitalist elements assumed a general character, the partial offensive developed into an offensive along the whole front. By the time the Sixteenth Party Congress was convened, the general offensive against the capitalist elements was proceeding all along the line. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Sixteenth Party Congress met on June 26, 1930. It was attended by 1,268 delegates with vote and 891 delegates with voice but no vote, representing 1,260,874 Party members and 711,609 candidate members. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Sixteenth Party Congress is known in the annals of the Party as "the congress of the sweeping offensive of Socialism <I>along the whole front</I>, of the elimination of the kulaks as a class, and of the realization of solid collectivization." (<I>Stalin.</I>) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Presenting the political report of the Central Committee, Comrade Stalin showed what big victories had been won by the Bolshevik Party in developing the Socialist offensive. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Socialist industrialization had progressed so far that the share of industry in the total production of the country now predominated over that of agriculture. In the fiscal year 1929-30, the share of industry already comprised no less than 53 per cent of the total production of the country, while the share of agriculture was about 47 per cent. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the fiscal year 1926-27, at the time of the Fifteenth Party Congress, the total output of industry had been only 102.5 per cent of the pre-war output; in the year 1929-30, at the time of the Sixteenth Congress, it was already about 180 per cent. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Heavy industry -- the production of means of production, machine-building -- was steadily growing in power. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    ". . . We are on the eve of the transformation of our country from an <I>agrarian</I> to an <I>industrial</I> country," declared Comrade Stalin at the congress, amidst hearty acclamation. 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Still, the high <I>rate</I> of industrial development, Comrade Stalin explained, was not to be confused with the <I>level</I> of industrial development. Despite the unprecedented rate of development of Socialist industry, we were still <I>far behind</I> the advanced capitalist countries as regards the <I>level</I> of industrial development. This was so in the case of electric power, in 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 311</B></FONT><P>

spite of the phenomenal progress of electrification in the U.S.S.R. This was the case with metal. According to the plan, the output of pig-iron in the U.S.S.R. was to be 5,500,000 tons in the year 1929-30, when the output of pig-iron in Germany in 1929 was 13,400,000 tons, and in France 10,450,000 tons. In order to make good our technical and economic backwardness in the minimum of time, our rate of industrial development had to be further accelerated, and a most resolute fight waged against the opportunists who were striving to reduce the rate of development of Socialist industry. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    ". . . People who talk about the necessity of <I>reducing</I> the rate of development of our industry are enemies of Socialism, agents of our class enemies," said Comrade Stalin. (Stalin, <I>Leninism</I>, Vol. II, "Political Report of the Central Committee to the Sixteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.") 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    After the program of the first year of the First Five-Year Plan had been successfully fulfilled and surpassed, a slogan originated among the masses -- "<I>Fulfil the Five-Year Plan in Four Years.</I>" A number of branches of industry (oil, peat, general machine-building, agricultural machinery, electrical equipment) were carrying out their plans so successfully that their five-year-plans could be fulfilled in two and a half or three years. This proved that the slogan "The Five-Year Plan in Four Years" was quite feasible, and thus exposed the opportunism of the sceptics who doubted it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Sixteenth Congress instructed the Central Committee of the Party to "ensure that the <I>spirited Bolshevik tempo</I> of Socialist construction be maintained, and that the <I>Five-Year Plan be actually fulfilled in four years.</I>" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     By the time of the Sixteenth Party Congress, a momentous change had taken place in the development of agriculture in the U.S.S.R. The broad masses of the peasantry had turned towards Socialism. On May I, 1930, collectivization in the principal grain-growing regions embraced 40-50 per cent of the peasant households (as against 2-3 per cent in the spring of 1928). The crop area of the collective farms reached 36,000 hectares. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus the increased program (30,000,000 hectares), laid down in the resolution of the Central Committee of January 5, 1930, was more than fulfilled. The five-year program of collective farm development had been fulfilled more than one and a half times in the space of two years. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In three years the amount of produce marketed by the collective farms had increased more than forty-fold. Already in 1930 more than 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 312</B></FONT><P>

half the marketed grain in the country came from the collective farms, quite apart from the grain produced by the state farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This meant that from now on the fortunes of agriculture would be decided not by the individual peasant farms, but by the collective and state farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    While, before the mass influx of the peasantry into the collective farms, the Soviet power had leaned mainly on Socialist industry, now it began to lean also on the rapidly expanding Socialist sector of agriculture, the collective and state farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The collective farm peasantry, as the Sixteenth Party Congress stated in one of its resolutions, had become "a real and firm mainstay of the Soviet power."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    When heavy industry and especially the machine-building industry had been built up and placed securely on their feet, and it was moreover clear that they were developing at a fairly rapid pace, the next task that faced the Party was to reconstruct all branches of the national economy on modern, up-to-date lines. Modern technique, modern machinery had to be supplied to the fuel industry, the metallurgical industry, the light industries, the food industry, the timber industry, the armament industry, the transport system, and to agriculture. In view of the colossal increase in the demand for farm produce and manufactured goods, it was necessary to double and treble output in all branches of production. But this could not be done unless the factories and mills, the state farms and collective farms were adequately supplied with up-to-date equipment, since the requisite increase of output could not be secured with the old equipment. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Unless the major branches of the national economy were reconstructed, it would be impossible to satisfy the new and ever growing demands of the country and its economic system. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Without reconstruction, it would be impossible to complete the offensive of Socialism along the whole front, for the capitalist elements in 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 313</B></FONT><P>

town and country had to be fought and vanquished not only by a new organization of labour and property, but also by a new technique, by technical superiority. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Without reconstruction, it would be impossible to overtake and outstrip the technically and economically advanced capitalist countries, for although the U.S.S.R. had surpassed the capitalist countries in rate of industrial development, it still lagged a long way behind them in level of industrial development, in quantity of industrial output. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In order that we might catch up with them, every branch of production had to be equipped with new technique and reconstructed on the most up-to-date technical lines. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The question of technique had thus become of decisive importance. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The main impediment was not so much an insufficiency of modern machinery and machine-tools -- for our machine-building industry was in a position to produce modern equipment -- as the wrong attitude of our business executives to technique, their tendency to underrate the importance of technique in the period of reconstruction and to disdain it. In their opinion, technical matters were the affair of the "experts," some thing of second-rate importance, to be left in charge of the "bourgeois experts"; they considered that Communist business executives need not interfere in the technical side of production and should attend to something more important, namely, the "general" management of industry. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The bourgeois "experts" were therefore given a free hand in matters of production, while the Communist business executives reserved to themselves the function of "general" direction, the signing of papers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It need scarcely be said that with such an attitude, "general" direction was bound to degenerate into a mere parody of direction, a sterile signing of papers, a futile fussing with papers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It is clear that if Communist business executives had persisted in this disdainful attitude of technical matters, we would never have been able to overtake the advanced capitalist countries, let alone outstrip them. This attitude, especially in the reconstruction period, would have doomed our country to backwardness, and would have lowered our rates of development. As a matter of fact, this attitude to technical matters was a screen, a mask for the secret wish of a certain section of the Communist business executives to retard, to reduce the rate of industrial development, so as to be able to "take it easy" by shunting the responsibility for production on to the "experts." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was necessary to get Communist business executives to turn their attention to technical matters, to acquire a taste for technique; they 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 314</B></FONT><P>

needed to be shown that it was vital for Bolshevik business executives to master modern technique, otherwise we would run the risk of condemning our country to backwardness and stagnation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Unless this problem were solved further progress would be impossible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Of utmost importance in this connection was the speech Comrade Stalin made at the First Conference of Industrial Managers in February 1931. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "It is sometimes asked," said Comrade Stalin, "whether it is not possible to slow down the tempo a bit, to put a check on the movement. No, comrades, it is not possible! The tempo must not be reduced! . . . To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "Incidentally, the history of old Russia is one unbroken record of the beatings she suffered for falling behind, for her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her -- for her backwardness. . . . 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance in ten years. Either we do it, or they crush us. . . . 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "In ten years at most we must make good the distance we are lagging behind the advanced capitalist countries. We have all the 'objective' opportunities for this. The only thing lacking is the ability to make proper use of these opportunities. And that depends on us. Only on us! It is time we learned to use these opportunities. It is time to put an end to the rotten policy of non-interference in production. It is time to adopt a new policy, a policy adapted to the times the policy of interfering in everything. If you are a factory manager, then interfere in all the affairs of the factory, look into everything, let nothing escape you, learn and learn again. Bolsheviks must master technique. It is time Bolsheviks themselves became experts. <I>In the period of reconstruction technique decides everything.</I>" (Stalin, <I>Leninism</I>, Vol. II, "The Tasks of Business Managers." ) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The historic importance of Comrade Stalin's speech lay in the fact that it put an end to the disdainful attitude of Communist business 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 315</B></FONT><P>

executives to technique, made them face the question of technique, opened a new phase in the struggle for the mastery of technique by the Bolsheviks themselves, and thereby helped to promote the work of economic reconstruction. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    From then on technical knowledge ceased to be a monopoly of the bourgeois "experts," and became a matter of vital concern to the Bolshevik business executives themselves, while the word "expert" ceased to be a term of disparagement and became the honourable title of Bolsheviks who had mastered technique. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    From then on there were bound to appear -- and there actually did appear -- thousands upon thousands, whole battalions of Red experts, who had mastered technique and were able to direct industries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a new, Soviet technical intelligentsia, an intelligentsia of the working class and the peasantry, and they now constitute the main force in the management of our industries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    All this was bound to promote, and actually did promote, the work of economic reconstruction. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Reconstruction was not confined to industry and transport. It developed even more rapidly in agriculture. The reason is not far to seek: agriculture was less mechanized than other branches, and here the need for modern machinery was felt more acutely than elsewhere. And it was urgently essential to increase the supply of modern agricultural machines now that the number of collective farms was growing from month to month and week to week, and with it the demand for thousands upon thousands of tractors and other agricultural machines. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The year 1931 witnessed a further advance in the collective-farm movement. In the principal grain-growing districts over 80 per cent of the peasant farms had already amalgamated to form collective farms. Here, solid collectivization had in the main already been achieved. In the less important grain-growing districts and in the districts growing industrial crops about 50 per cent of the peasant farms had joined the collective farms. By now there were 500,000 collective farms and 4,000 state farms, which together cultivated two-thirds of the total crop area of the country, the individual peasants cultivating only one-third. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a tremendous victory for Socialism in the countryside. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But the progress of the collective-farm movement was so far to be measured in breadth rather than in depth: the collective farms were increasing in number and were spreading to district after district, but there was no commensurate improvement in the work of the collective farms or in the skill of their personnel. This was due to the fact that the growth of the leading cadres and trained personnel of the collective 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 316</B></FONT><P>

farms was not keeping pace with the numerical growth of the collective farms themselves. The consequence was that the work of the new collective farms was not always satisfactory, and the collective farms themselves were still weak. They were also held back by the shortage in the countryside of literate people indispensable to the collective farms (book-keepers, stores managers, secretaries, etc.), and by the inexperience of the peasants in the management of large-scale collective enterprises. The collective farmers were the individual peasants of yesterday; they had experience in farming small plots of land, but none in managing big, collective farms. This experience could not be acquired in a day. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The first stages of collective farm work were consequently marred by serious defects. It was found that work was still badly organized in the collective farms; labour discipline was slack. In many collective farms the income was distributed not by the number of work-day-units, but by the number of mouths to feed in the family. It often happened that slackers got a bigger return than conscientious hard-working collective farmers. These defects in the management of collective farms lowered the incentive of their members. There were many cases of members absenting themselves from work even at the height of the season, leaving part of the crops unharvested until the winter snows, while the reaping was done so carelessly that large quantities of grain were lost. The absence of individual responsibility for machines and horses, and for work generally, weakened the collective farms and reduced their revenues. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The situation was particularly bad wherever former kulaks and their toadies had managed to worm their way into collective farms and to secure positions of trust in them. Not infrequently former kulaks would betake themselves to districts where they were unknown, and there make their way into the collective farms with the deliberate intention of sabotaging and doing mischief. Sometimes, owing to lack of vigilance on the part of Party workers and Soviet officials, kulaks managed to get into collective farms even in their own districts. What made it easier for former kulaks to penetrate into the collective farms was that they had radically changed their tactics. Formerly the kulaks had fought the collective farms openly, had savagely persecuted collective farm leading cadres and foremost collective farmers, nefariously murdering them, burning down their houses and barns. By these methods they had thought to intimidate the peasantry and to deter them from joining the collective farms. Now that their open struggle against the collective farms had failed, they changed their tactics. They laid aside their sawn-off shotguns and posed as innocent, unoffending folk who would not hurt 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 317</B></FONT><P>

a fly. They pretended to be loyal Soviet supporters. Once inside the collective farms they stealthily carried on their sabotage. They strove to disorganize the collective farms from within, to undermine labour discipline and to muddle the harvest accounts and the records of work performed. It was part of their sinister scheme to destroy the horses of the collective farms by deliberately infecting them with glanders, mange and other diseases, or disabling them by neglect or other methods, in which they were often successful. They did damage to tractors and farm machinery. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The kulaks were often able to deceive the collective farmers and commit sabotage with impunity because the collective farms were still weak and their personnel still inexperienced. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To put an end to the sabotage of the kulaks and to expedite the work of strengthening the collective farms, the latter had to be given urgent and effective assistance in men, advice and leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This assistance was forthcoming from the Bolshevik Party. In January 1933, the Central Committee of the Party adopted a decision to organize <I>political departments</I> in the machine and tractor stations serving the collective farms. Some 17,000 Party members were sent into the countryside to work in these political departments and to aid the collective farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This assistance was highly effective. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In two years (1933 and 1934) the political departments of the machine and tractor stations did a great deal to build up an active body of collective farmers, to eliminate the defects in the work of the collective farms, to consolidate them, and to rid them of kulak enemies and wreckers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The political departments performed their task with credit: they strengthened the collective farms both in regard to organization and efficiency, trained skilled personnel for them, improved their management and raised the political level of the collective farm members. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Of great importance in stimulating the collective farmers to strive for the strengthening of the collective farms was the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers (February 1933) and the speech made by Comrade Stalin at this congress. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Contrasting the old, pre-collective farm system in the countryside with the new, collective farm system, Comrade Stalin said: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     "Under the old system the peasants each worked in isolation, following the ancient methods of their forefathers and using antiquated implements of labour; they worked for the landlords and capitalists, the kulaks and profiteers; they lived in penury while they 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 318</B></FONT><P>

enriched others. Under the new, collective farm system, the peasants work in common, co-operatively, with the help of modern implements -- tractors and agricultural machinery; they work for themselves and their collective farms; they live without capitalists and landlords, without kulaks and profiteers; they work with the object of raising their standard of welfare and culture from day to day." (Stalin, <I>Problems of Leninism</I>, Russ. ed., p. 528.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Comrade Stalin showed in this speech what the peasants had achieved by adopting the collective farm way. The Bolshevik Party had helped millions of poor peasants to join the collective farms and to escape from servitude to the kulaks. By joining the collective farms, and having the best lands and the finest instruments of production at their disposal, millions of poor peasants who had formerly lived in penury had now as collective farmers risen to the level of middle peasants, and had attained material security. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This was the first step in the development of collective farms, the first achievement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The next step, Comrade Stalin said, was to raise the collective farmers -- both former poor peasants and former middle peasants -- to an even higher level, to make all the collective farmers prosperous and all the collective farms Bolshevik. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "Only one thing is now needed for the collective farmers to become prosperous," Comrade Stalin said, "and that is for them to work in the collective farms conscientiously, to make efficient use of the tractors and machines, to make efficient use of the draught cattle, to cultivate the land efficiently, and to cherish collective farm property." (<I>Ibid.</I>, pp. 532-3.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Comrade Stalin's speech made a profound impression on the millions of collective farmers and became a practical program of action for the collective farms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     By the end of 1934 the collective farms had become a strong and invincible force. They already embraced about three-quarters of all the peasant households in the Soviet Union and about 90 per cent of the total crop area. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In 1934 there were already 281,000 tractors and 32,000 harvester combines at work in the Soviet countryside. The spring sowing in that year was completed fifteen to twenty days earlier than in 1933, and thirty to forty days earlier than in 1932, while the plan of grain deliveries to the state was fulfilled three months earlier than in 1932. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This showed how firmly established the collective farms had become 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 319</B></FONT><P>

in two years, thanks to the tremendous assistance given them by the Party and the workers' and peasants' state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This solid victory of the collective farm system and the attendant improvement of agriculture enabled the Soviet Government to abolish the rationing of bread and all other products and to introduce the unrestricted sale of foodstuffs.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Since the political departments of the machine and tractor stations had served the purpose for which they had been temporarily created, the Central Committee decided to convert them into ordinary Party bodies by merging them with the district Party Committees in their localities.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    All these achievements, both in agriculture and in industry, were made possible by the successful fulfilment of the Five-Year Plan.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    By the beginning of 1933 it was evident that the First Five-Year Plan had already been fulfilled ahead of time, fulfilled in four years and three months. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a tremendous, epoch-making victory of the working class and peasantry of the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Reporting to a plenary meeting of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the Party, held in January 1933, Comrade Stalin reviewed the results of the First Five-Year Plan. The report made it clear that in the period which it took to fulfil the First Five-Year Plan, the Party and the Soviet Government had achieved the following major results. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    a)&nbsp;The U.S.S.R. had been converted from an agrarian country into an industrial country, for the proportion of industrial output to the total production of the country had risen to 70 per cent.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    b)&nbsp;The Socialist economic system had eliminated the capitalist elements in the sphere of industry and had become the sole economic system in industry.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    c)&nbsp;The Socialist economic system had eliminated the kulaks as a class in the sphere of agriculture, and had become the predominant force in agriculture.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    d)&nbsp;The collective farm system had put an end to poverty and want in the countryside, and tens of millions of poor peasants had risen to a level of material security.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    e )&nbsp;The Socialist system in industry had abolished unemployment, and while retaining the 8-hour day in a number of branches, had introduced the 7-hour day in the vast majority of enterprises and the 6-hour day in unhealthy occupations.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    f)&nbsp;The victory of Socialism in all branches of the national economy had abolished the exploitation of man by man.

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 320</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The sum and substance of the achievements of the First Five-Year Plan was that they had completely emancipated the workers and peasants from exploitation and had opened the way to a prosperous and cultured life for all working people in the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In January 1934 the Party held its Seventeenth Congress. It was attended by 1,225 delegates with vote and 736 delegates with voice but no vote, representing 1,874,488 Party members and 935,298 candidate members. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The congress reviewed the work of the Party since the last congress. It noted the decisive results achieved by Socialism in all branches of economic and cultural life and placed on record that the general line of the Party had triumphed along the whole front. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Seventeenth Party Congress is known in history as the "Congress of Victors." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Reporting on the work of the Central Committee, Comrade Stalin pointed to the fundamental changes that had taken place in the U.S.S.R. during the period under review. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "During this period, the U.S.S.R. has become radically transformed and has cast off the integument of backwardness and mediaevalism. From an agrarian country it has become an industrial country. From a country of small individual agriculture it has become a country of collective, large-scale mechanized agriculture. From an ignorant, illiterate and uncultured country it has become -- or rather it is becoming -- a literate and cultured country covered by a vast network of higher, intermediate and elementary schools teaching in the languages of the nationalities of the U.S.S.R. (Stalin, <I>Seventeenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.</I>, "Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.[B.]," p. 30.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    By this time 99 per cent of the industry of the country was Socialist industry. Socialist agriculture -- the collective farms and state farms --  embraced about 90 per cent of the total crop area of the country. As to trade, the capitalist elements had been completely ousted from this domain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When the New Economic Policy was being introduced, Lenin said that there were the elements of five social-economic formations in our country. The first was patriarchal economy, which was largely a natural form of economy, <I>i.e.</I>, which practically carried on no trade. The second formation was small commodity production, as represented by the majority of the peasant farms, those which sold agricultural produce, and by the artisans. In the first years of NEP this economic formation embraced 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 321</B></FONT><P>

the majority of the population. The third formation was private capitalism, which had begun to revive in the early period of NEP. The fourth formation was state capitalism, chiefly in the form of concessions, which had not developed to any considerable extent. The fifth formation was Socialism: Socialist industry, which was still weak, state farms and collective farms, which were economically insignificant at the beginning of NEP, state trade and co-operative societies, which were also weak at that time. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Of all these formations, Lenin said, the Socialist formation must gain the upper hand. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The New Economic Policy was designed to bring about the complete victory of Socialist forms of economy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     And by the time of the Seventeenth Party Congress this aim had already been achieved. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "We can now say," said Comrade Stalin, "that the first, the third and the fourth social-economic formations no longer exist; the second social-economic formation has been forced into a secondary position, while the fifth social-economic formation -- the Socialist formation -- now holds unchallenged sway and is the sole commanding force in the whole national economy." (<I>Ibid.</I>, p. 33.)

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    An important place in Comrade Stalin's report was given to the question of ideological-political leadership. He warned the Party that although its enemies, the opportunists and nationalist deviators of all shades and complexions, had been defeated, remnants of their ideology still lingered in the minds of some Party members and often asserted themselves. The survivals of capitalism in economic life and particularly in the minds of men provided a favourable soil for the revival of the ideology of the defeated anti-Leninist groups. The development of people's mentality does not keep pace with their economic position. As a consequence, survivals of bourgeois ideas still remained in men's minds and would continue to do so even though capitalism had been abolished in economic life. It should also be borne in mind that the surrounding capitalist world, against which we had to keep our powder dry, was working to revive and foster these survivals. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Comrade Stalin also dwelt on the survivals of capitalism in men's minds on the national question, where they were particularly tenacious. The Bolshevik Party was fighting on two fronts, both against the deviation to Great-Russian chauvinism and against the deviation to local nationalism. In a number of republics (the Ukraine, Byelorussia, and others) the Party organizations had relaxed the struggle against local

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 322</B></FONT><P>

nationalism, and had allowed it to grow to such an extent that it had allied itself with hostile forces, the forces of intervention, and had become a danger to the state. In reply to the question, which deviation in the national question was the major danger, Comrade Stalin said: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The major danger is the deviation against which we have ceased to fight, thereby allowing it to grow into a danger to the state." (<I>Ibid.</I>, p. 81.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Comrade Stalin called upon the Party to be more active in ideological-political work, systematically to expose the ideology and the remnants of the ideology of the hostile classes and of the trends hostile to Leninism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He further pointed out in his report that the adoption of correct decisions does not in itself guarantee the success of a measure. In order to guarantee success, it was necessary to <I>put the right people in the right place</I>, people able to give effect to the decisions of the leading organs and to <I>keep a check on the fulfilment</I> of decisions. Without these organizational measures there was a risk of decisions remaining scraps of paper, divorced from practical life. Comrade Stalin referred in support of this to Lenin's famous maximum that the chief thing in organizational work was the <I>choice of personnel and the keeping of a check on the fulfilment of decisions.</I> Comrade Stalin said that the disparity between adopted decisions and the organizational work of putting these decisions into effect and of keeping a check on their fulfilment was the chief evil in our practical work. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In order to keep a better check on the fulfilment of Party and Government decisions, the Seventeenth Party Congress set up a Party Control Commission under the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) and a Soviet Control Commission under the Council of People's Commissars of the U.S.S.R. in place of the combined Central Control Commission and Workers' and Peasants' Inspection, this body having completed the tasks for which it had been set up by the Twelfth Party Congress. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Comrade Stalin formulated the organizational tasks of the Party in the new stage as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     1)&nbsp;Our organizational work must be adapted to the requirements of the political line of the Party; 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     2)&nbsp;Organizational leadership must be raised to the level of political leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     3)&nbsp;Organizational leadership must be made fully equal to the task of ensuring the realization of the political slogans and decisions of the Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In conclusion, Comrade Stalin warned the Party that although 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 323</B></FONT><P>

Socialism had achieved great successes, successes of which we could be justly proud, we must not allow ourselves to be carried away, to get "swelled head," to be lulled by success. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ". . . We must not lull the Party, but sharpen its vigilance; we must not lull it to sleep, but keep it ready for action; not disarm it, but arm it; not demobilize it, but hold it in a state of mobilization for the fulfilment of the Second Five-Year Plan," said Comrade Stalin. (<I>Ibid.</I>, p. 96.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Seventeenth Congress heard reports from Comrades Molotov and Kuibyshev on the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The program of the Second Five-Year Plan was even vaster than that of the First Five-Year Plan. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan period, in 1937, industrial output was to be increased approximately eightfold in comparison with pre-war. Capital development investments in all branches in the period of the Second Five-Year Plan were to amount to 133,000,000,000 rubles, as against a little over 64,000,000,000 rubles in the period of the First Five-Year Plan. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This immense scope of new capital construction work would ensure the complete technical re-equipment of all branches of the national economy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Second Five-Year Plan was to complete in the main the mechanization of agriculture. Aggregate tractor power was to increase from 2,250,000 hp. in 1932 to over 8,000,000 hp. in 1937. The plan provided for the extensive employment of scientific agricultural methods (correct crop rotation, use of selected seed, autumn ploughing, etc.). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    A tremendous plan for the technical reconstruction of the means of transport and communication was outlined. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Second Five-Year Plan contained an extensive program for the further improvement of the material and cultural standards of the workers and peasants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Seventeenth Congress paid great attention to matters of organization and adopted decisions on the work of the Party and the Soviets in connection with a report made by Comrade Kaganovich. The question of organization had acquired even greater importance now that the general line of the Party had won and the Party policy had been tried and tested by the experience of millions of workers and peasants. The new and complex tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan called for higher standard of work in all spheres. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 324</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The major tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, <I>viz.</I>, to completely eliminate the capitalist elements, to overcome the survivals of capitalism in economic life and in the minds of men, to complete the reconstruction of the whole national economy on modern technical lines, to learn to use the new technical equipment and the new enterprises, to mechanize agriculture and increase its productivity -- insistently and urgently confront us with the problem of <I>improving work in all spheres</I>, <I>first and foremost in practical organizational leadership</I>," it was stated in the decisions of the congress on organizational questions. (<I>Resolutions of the C.P.S.U.[B.]</I>, Russ. ed., Part II, p. 591.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Seventeenth Congress adopted new Party Rules, which differ from the old ones firstly by the addition of a preamble. This preamble gives a brief definition of the Communist Party, and a definition of its role in the struggle of the proletariat and its place in the organism of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The new rules enumerate in detail the duties of Party members. Stricter regulations governing the admission of new members and a clause concerning sympathizers' groups were introduced. The new rules give a more detailed exposition of the organizational structure of the Party, and formulate anew the clauses dealing with the Party nuclei, or primary organizations, as they have been called since the Seventeenth Party Congress. The clauses dealing with inner Party democracy and Party discipline were also formulated anew.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The achievements of Socialism in our country were a cause of rejoicing not only to the Party, and not only to the workers and collective farmers, but also to our Soviet intelligentsia, and to all honest citizens of the Soviet Union. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    But they were no cause of rejoicing to the remnants of the defeated exploiting classes; on the contrary, they only enraged them the more as time went on. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    They infuriated the lickspittles of the defeated classes -- the puny remnants of the following of Bukharin and Trotsky. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These gentry were guided in their evaluation of the achievements 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 325</B></FONT><P>

of the workers and collective farmers not by the interests of the people, who applauded every such achievement, but by the interests of their own wretched and putrid faction, which had lost all contact with the realities of life. Since the achievements of Socialism in our country meant the victory of the policy of the Party and the utter bankruptcy of their own policy, these gentry, instead of admitting the obvious facts and joining the common cause, began to revenge themselves on the Party and the people for their own failure, for their own bankruptcy; they began to resort to foul play and sabotage against the cause of the workers and collective farmers, to blow up pits, set fire to factories, and commit acts of wrecking in collective and state farms, with the object of undoing the achievements of the workers and collective farmers and evoking popular discontent against the Soviet Government. And in order, while doing so, to shield their puny group from exposure and destruction, they simulated loyalty to the Party, fawned upon it, eulogized it, cringed before it more and more, while in reality continuing their underhand, subversive activities against the workers and peasants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    At the Seventeenth Party Congress, Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky made repentant speeches, praising the Party and extolling its achievements to the skies. But the congress detected a ring of insincerity and duplicity in their speeches; for what the Party expects from its members is not eulogies and rhapsodies over its achievements, but conscientious work on the Socialist front. And this was what the Bukharinites had showed no signs of for a long time. The Party saw that the hollow speeches of these gentry were in reality meant for their supporters outside the congress, to serve as a lesson to them in duplicity, and a call to them not to lay down their arms. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Speeches were also made at the Seventeenth Congress by the Trotskyites Zinoviev and Kamenev, who lashed themselves extravagantly for their mistakes, and eulogized the Party no less extravagantly for its achievements. But the congress could not help seeing that both their nauseating self-castigation and their fulsome praise of the Party were only meant to hide an uneasy and unclean conscience. However, the Party did not yet know or suspect that while these gentry were making their cloying speeches at the congress they were hatching a villainous plot against the life of S. M. Kirov. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    On December 1, 1934, S. M. Kirov was foully murdered in the Smolny, in Leningrad, by a shot from a revolver. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The assassin was caught red-handed and turned out to be a member of a secret counter-revolutionary group made up of members of an anti-Soviet group of Zinovievites in Leningrad. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 326</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    S. M. Kirov was loved by the Party and the working class, and his murder stirred the people profoundly, sending a wave of wrath and deep sorrow through the country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The investigation established that in 1933 and 1934 an underground counter-revolutionary terrorist group had been formed in Leningrad consisting of former members of the Zinoviev opposition and headed by a so-called "Leningrad Centre." The purpose of this group was to murder leaders of the Communist Party. S. M. Kirov was chosen as the first victim. The testimony of the members of this counter-revolutionary group showed that they were connected with representatives of foreign capitalist states and were receiving funds from them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The exposed members of this organization were sentenced by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. to the supreme penalty -- to be shot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Soon afterwards the existence of an underground counter-revolutionary organization called the "Moscow Centre" was discovered. The preliminary investigation and the trial revealed the villainous part played by Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yevdokimov and other leaders of this organization in cultivating the terrorist mentality among their followers, and in plotting the murder of members of the Party Central Committee and of the Soviet Government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     To such depths of duplicity and villainy had these people sunk that Zinoviev, who was one of the organizers and instigators of the assassination of S. M. Kirov, and who had urged the murderer to hasten the crime, wrote an obituary of Kirov speaking of him in terms of eulogy, and demanded that it be published. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Zinovievites simulated remorse in court; but they persisted in their duplicity even in the dock. They concealed their connection with Trotsky. They concealed the fact that together with the Trotskyites they had sold themselves to fascist espionage services. They concealed their spying and wrecking activities. They concealed from the court their connections with the Bukharinites, and the existence of a united Trotsky-Bukharin gang of fascist hirelings. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As it later transpired, the murder of Comrade Kirov was the work of this united Trotsky-Bukharin gang. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Even then, in 1935, it had become clear that the Zinoviev group was a camouflaged Whiteguard organization whose members fully deserved to be treated as Whiteguards. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A year later it became known that the actual, real and direct organizers of the murder of Kirov were Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their accomplices, and that they had also made preparations for the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 327</B></FONT><P>

assassination of other members of the Central Committee. Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bakayev, Yevdokimov, Pikel, I. N. Smirnov, Mrachkovsky, Ter-Vaganyan, Reingold and others were committed for trial. Confronted by direct evidence, they had to admit publicly, in open court, that they had not only organized the assassination of Kirov, but had been planning to murder all the other leaders of the Party and the Government. Later investigation established the fact that these villains had been engaged in espionage and in organizing acts of diversion. The full extent of the monstrous moral and political depravity of these men, their despicable villainy and treachery, concealed by hypocritical professions of loyalty to the Party, were revealed at a trial in Moscow, 1936. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The chief instigator and ringleader of this gang of assassins and spies was Judas Trotsky. Trotsky's assistants and agents in carrying out his counter-revolutionary instructions were Zinoviev, Kamenev and their Trotskyite underlings. They were preparing to bring about the defeat of the U.S.S.R. in the event of attack by imperialist countries; they had become defeatists with regard to the workers' and peasants' state; they had become despicable tools and agents of the German and Japanese fascists. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The main lesson which the Party organizations had to draw from the trials of the persons implicated in the foul murder of S. M. Kirov was that they must put an end to their own political blindness and political heedlessness, and must increase their vigilance and the vigilance of all Party members. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In a circular letter to Party organizations on the subject of the foul murder of S. M. Kirov, the Central Committee of the Party stated: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "a)&nbsp;We must put an end to the opportunist complacency engendered by the enormous assumption that as we grow stronger the enemy will become tamer and more inoffensive. This assumption is an utter fallacy. It is a recrudescence of the Right deviation, which assured all and sundry that our enemies would little by little creep into Socialism and in the end become real Socialists. The Bolsheviks have no business to rest on their laurels; they have no business to sleep at their posts. What we need is not complacency, but vigilance, real Bolshevik revolutionary vigilance. It should be remembered that the more hopeless the position of the enemies, the more eagerly will they dutch at 'extreme measures' as the only recourse of the doomed in their struggle against the Soviet power. We must remember this, and be vigilant. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
       "b)&nbsp;We must properly organize the teaching of the history of

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 328</B></FONT><P>

the Party to Party members, the study of all and sundry anti-Party groups in the history of our Party, their methods of combating the Party line, their tactics and -- still more the tactics and methods of our Party in combating anti-Party groups, the tactics and methods which have enabled our Party to vanquish and demolish these groups. Party members should not only know how the Party combated and vanquished the Constitutional-Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Anarchists, but also how it combated and vanquished the Trotskyites, the 'Democratic-Centralists,' the 'Workers' Opposition,' the Zinovievites, the Right deviators, the Right-Leftist freaks and the like. It should never be forgotten that a knowledge and understanding of the history of our Party is a most important and essential means of fully ensuring the revolutionary vigilance of the Party members." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Of enormous importance in this period was the purge of the Party ranks from adventitious and alien elements, begun in 1933, and especially the careful verification of the records of Party members and the exchange of old Party cards for new ones undertaken after the foul murder of S. M. Kirov. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Prior to the verification of the records of Party members, irresponsibility and negligence in the handling of Party cards had prevailed in many Party organizations. In a number of the organizations utterly intolerable chaos in the registration of Communists was revealed, a state of affairs which enemies had been turning to their nefarious ends, using the possession of a Party card as a screen for espionage, wrecking, etc. Many leaders of Party organizations had entrusted the enrolment of new members and the issuance of Party cards to persons in minor positions, and often even to Party members of untested reliability. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In a circular letter to all organizations dated May 13, 1935, on the subject of the registration, safekeeping and issuance of Party cards, the Central Committee instructed all organizations to make a careful verification of the records of Party members and "to establish Bolshevik order in our own Party home." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The verification of the records of Party members was of great political value. In connection with the report of Comrade Yezhov, Secretary of the Central Committee, on the results of the verification of the records of Party members, a plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Party adopted a resolution on December 25, 1935, declaring that this verification was an organizational and political measure of enormous importance in strengthening the ranks of the C.P.S.U.(B.) 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 329</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    After the verification of the records of Party members and the exchange of Party cards, the admission of new members into the Party was resumed. In this connection the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.(B.) demanded that new members should not be admitted into the Party wholesale, but on the basis of a strictly individual enrolment of "people really advanced and really devoted to the cause of the working class, the finest people of our country, drawn above all from among the workers, and also from among peasants and active intelligentsia, who had been tried and tested in various sectors of the struggle for Socialism." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In resuming the admission of new members to the Party, the Central Committee instructed Party organizations to bear in mind that hostile elements would persist in their attempts to worm their way into the ranks of the C.P.S.U.(B.). Consequently: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
"It is the task of every Party organization to increase Bolshevik vigilance to the utmost, to hold aloft the banner of the Leninist Party, and to safeguard the ranks of the Party from the penetration of alien, hostile and adventitious elements." (Resolution of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.[B.], September 29, 1936, published in <I>Pravda</I> No. 270, 1936.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Purging and consolidating its ranks, destroying the enemies of the Party and relentlessly combating distortions of the Party line, the Bolshevik Party rallied closer than ever around its Central Committee under whose leadership the Party and the Soviet land now passed to a new stage -- the completion of the construction of a classless, Socialist society.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In the period 1930-34 the Bolshevik Party solved what was, after the winning of power, the most difficult historical problem of the proletarian revolution, namely, to get the millions of small peasant owners to adopt the path of collective farming, the path of Socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The elimination of the kulaks, the most numerous of the exploiting classes, and the adoption of collective farming by the bulk of the peasants led to the destruction of the last roots of capitalism in the country, to the final victory of Socialism in agriculture, and to the complete consolidation of the Soviet power in the countryside. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After overcoming a number of difficulties of an organizational character, the collective farms became firmly established and entered upon the path of prosperity. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 330</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The effect of the First Five-Year Plan was to lay an unshakable foundation of a Socialist economic system in our country in the shape of a first-class Socialist heavy industry and collective mechanized agriculture, to put an end to unemployment, to abolish the exploitation of man by man, and to create the conditions for the steady improvement of the material and cultural standards of our working people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These colossal achievements were attained by the working class, the collective farmers, and the working people of our country generally, thanks to the bold, revolutionary and wise policy of the Party and the Government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The surrounding capitalist world, striving to undermine and disrupt the might of the U.S.S.R., worked with redoubled energy to organize gangs of assassins, wreckers and spies within the U.S.S.R. This hostile activity of the capitalist encirclement became particularly marked with the advent of fascism to power in Germany and Japan. In the Trotskyites and Zinovievites, fascism found faithful servants who were ready to spy, sabotage, commit acts of terrorism and diversion, and to work for the defeat of the U.S.S.R. in order to restore capitalism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Soviet Government punished these degenerates with an iron hand, dealing ruthlessly with these enemies of the people and traitors to the country.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The economic crisis that had broken out in the capitalist countries in the latter half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1933. After that industry ceased to decline, the crisis was succeeded by a period of stagnation, and was then followed by a certain revival, a certain upward trend. But this upward trend was not of the kind that ushers in an industrial boom on a new and higher basis. World capitalist industry was unable even to reach the level of 1929, attaining by the middle of 1937 only 95-96 per cent of that level. And already in the second half of 1937 a new economic crisis began, affecting first of all the United States. By the end of 1937 the number of unemployed in the U.S.A. had again risen to ten million. In Great Britain, too, unemployment was rapidly increasing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The capitalist countries thus found themselves faced with a new economic crisis before they had even recovered from the ravages of the preceding one. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The result was that the contradictions between the imperialist countries, as likewise between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, grew still more acute. As a consequence, the aggressor states redoubled their efforts to recoup themselves for the losses caused by the economic crisis at home at the expense of other, poorly defended, countries. The two notorious aggressor states, Germany and Japan, were this time joined by a third -- Italy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In 1935, fascist Italy attacked Ethiopia and subjugated her. She did so without any reason or justification in "international law"; she 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 332</B></FONT><P>

attacked her like a robber, without declaring war, as is now the vogue with the fascists. This was a blow not only at Ethiopia, but also at Great Britain, at her sea routes from Europe to India and to Asia generally. Great Britain vainly attempted to prevent Italy from establishing herself in Ethiopia. Italy later withdrew from the League of Nations so as to leave her hands free, and began to arm on an intensive scale. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, on the shortest sea routes between Europe and Asia, a new war knot was tied. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Fascist Germany tore up the Versailles Peace Treaty by a unilateral act, and adopted a scheme for the <I>forcible</I> revision of the map of Europe. The German fascists made no secret of the fact that they were seeking to subjugate the neighbouring states, or, at least, to seize such of their territories as were peopled by Germans. Accordingly, they planned first to seize Austria, then to strike at Czechoslovakia, then, maybe, at Poland -- which also has a compact territory peopled by Germans and bordering on Germany -- and then . . . well, then "we shall see." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the summer of 1936, Germany and Italy started military intervention against the Spanish Republic. Under the guise of supporting the Spanish fascists, they secured the opportunity of surreptitiously landing troops on Spanish territory, in the rear of France, and stationing their fleets in Spanish waters -- in the zones of the Balearic Islands and Gibraltar in the south, the Atlantic Ocean in the west, and the Bay of Biscay in the north. At the beginning of 1938 the German fascists seized Austria, thus establishing themselves in the middle reaches of the Danube and expanding in the south of Europe, towards the Adriatic Sea. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The German and Italian fascists extended their intervention in Spain, at the same time assuring the world that they were fighting the Spanish "Reds" and harboured no other designs. But this was a crude and shallow camouflage designed to deceive simpletons. As a matter of fact, they were striking at Great Britain and France, by bestriding the sea communications of these countries with their vast African and Asiatic colonial possessions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As to the seizure of Austria, this at any rate could not be passed off as a struggle against the Versailles Treaty, as part of Germany's effort to protect her "national" interests by recovering territory lost in the first Imperialist War. Austria had not formed part of Germany, either before or after the war. The <I>forcible</I> annexation of Austria was a glaring imperialist seizure of foreign territory. It left no doubt as to fascist Germany's designs to gain a  dominant position on the West European continent. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 333</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was above all a blow at the interests of France and Great Britain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, in the south of Europe, in the zone of Austria and the Adriatic, and in the extreme west of Europe, in the zone of Spain and the waters washing her shores, new war knots were tied. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In 1937, the Japanese fascist militarists seized Peiping, invaded Central China and occupied Shanghai. Like the Japanese invasion of Manchuria several years earlier, the invasion of Central China was effected by the customary Japanese method, in robber fashion, by the dishonest exploitation of various "local incidents" engineered by the Japanese themselves, and in violation of all "international standards," treaties, agreements, etc. The seizure of Tientsin and Shanghai placed the keys of the immense China market in the hands of Japan. As long as Japan holds Shanghai and Tientsin, she can at any moment oust Great Britain and the U.S.A. from Central China, where they have huge investments. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Of course, the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and their army against the Japanese invaders, the tremendous national revival in China, her huge resources of man-power and territory, and, lastly, the determination of the Chinese National Government to fight the struggle for emancipation to a finish, until the invaders are completely driven out from Chinese territory, all go to show beyond a doubt that there is no future for the Japanese imperialists in China, and never will be. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But it is nevertheless true that for the time being Japan holds the keys of China's trade, and that her war on China is in effect a most serious blow at the interests of Great Britain and the U.S.A. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, in the Pacific, in the zone of China, one more war knot was tied. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All these facts show that a second imperialist war has actually begun. It began stealthily, without any declaration of war. States and nations have, almost imperceptibly, slipped into the orbit of a second imperialist war. It was the three aggressor states, the fascist ruling circles of Germany, Italy and Japan, that began the war in various parts of the world. It is being waged over a huge expanse of territory, stretching from Gibraltar to Shanghai. It has already drawn over five hundred million people into its orbit. In the final analysis, it is being waged against the capitalist interests of Great Britain, France and the U.S.A., since its object is a redivision of the world and of the spheres of influence in favour of the aggressor countries and at the expense of the so-called democratic states. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A distinguishing feature of the second imperialist war is that so far 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 334</B></FONT><P>

it is being waged and extended by the aggressor powers, while the other powers, the "democratic" powers, against whom in fact the war is directed, pretend that it does not concern them, wash their hands of it, draw back, boast of their love of peace, scold the fascist aggressors, and . . . surrender their positions to the aggressors bit by bit, at the same time asserting that they are preparing to resist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This war, it will be seen, is of a rather strange and one-sided character. But that does not prevent it from being a brutal war of unmitigated conquest waged at the expense of the poorly defended peoples of Ethiopia, Spain and China. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It would be wrong to attribute this one-sided character of the war to the military or economic weakness of the "democratic" states. The "democratic" states are, of course, stronger than the fascist states. The one-sided character of the developing world war is due to the absence of a united front of the "democratic" states against the fascist powers. The so-called democratic states, of course, do not approve of the "excesses" of the fascist states and fear any accession of strength to the latter. But they fear even more the working-class movement in Europe .J, and the movement of national emancipation in Asia, and regard fascism as an "excellent antidote" to these "dangerous" movements. For this reason the ruling circles of the "democratic" states, especially the ruling Conservative circles of Great Britain, confine themselves to a policy of pleading with the overweening fascist rulers "not to go to extremes," at the same time giving them to understand that they "fully comprehend" and on the whole sympathize with their reactionary police policy towards the working-class movement and the national emancipation movement. In this respect, the ruling circles of Britain are roughly pursuing the same policy as was pursued under tsardom by the Russian liberal-monarchist bourgeois, who, while fearing the "excesses" of tsarist policy, feared the people even more, and therefore resorted to a policy of pleading with the tsar and, consequently, of <I>conspiring</I> with the tsar against the people. As we know, the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie of Russia paid dearly for this dual policy. It may be presumed that history will exact retribution also from the ruling circles of Britain, and of their friends in France and the U.S.A. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Clearly, the U.S.S.R. could not shut its eyes to such a turn in the international situation and ignore the ominous events. Any war, however small, started by the aggressors, constitutes a menace to the peaceable countries. The second imperialist war, which has so "imperceptibly" stolen upon the nations and has involved over five hundred million people, is bound all the more to represent a most serious danger to all nations, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 335</B></FONT><P>

and to the U.S.S.R in the first place. This is eloquently borne out by the formation of the "Anti-Communist Bloc" by Germany, Italy and Japan. Therefore, our country, while pursuing its policy of peace, set to work to further strengthen its frontier defences and the fighting efficiency of its Red Army and Navy. Towards the end of 1934 the U.S.S.R. joined the League of Nations. It did so in the knowledge that the League in spite of its weakness, might nevertheless serve as a place where aggressors can be exposed, and as a certain instrument of peace, however feeble, that might hinder the outbreak of war. The Soviet Union considered that in times like these even so weak an international organization as the League of Nations should not be ignored. In May 1935 a treaty of mutual assistance against possible attack by aggressors was signed between France and the U.S.S.R. A similar treaty was simultaneously concluded between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. In March 1936 the U.S.S.R. signed a treaty of mutual assistance with the Mongolian People's Republic, and in August 1937 a pact of non-aggression with the Republic of China.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Whereas, three years after the economic crisis of 1930-33, a new economic crisis began in the capitalist countries, in the U.S.S.R. industry continued to make steady progress <I>during the whole of this period.</I> Whereas by the middle of 1937 world capitalist industry, as a whole, had barely attained 95-96 per cent of the level of production of 1929, only to be caught in the throes of a new crisis in the second half of 1937, the industry of the U.S.S.R. in its steady cumulative progress, had by the end of 1937 attained 428 per cent of the output of 1929, or over 700 per cent of the pre-war output. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These achievements were a direct result of the policy of reconstruction so persistently pursued by the Party and the Government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The result of these achievements was that the Second Five-Year Plan of industry was fulfilled ahead of time. It was completed by April 1, 1937, that is, in four years and three months. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a most important victory for Socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Progress in agriculture presented very much the same picture. The 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 336</B></FONT><P>

total area under all crops increased from 105,000,000 hectares in 1913 (pre-war) to 135,000,000 hectares in 1937.  The grain harvest increased from 4,800,000,000 poods in 1913, to 6,800,000,000 poods in 1937, the raw cotton crop from 44,000,000 poods to 154,000,000 poods, the flax crop (fibre) from 19,000,000 poods to 31,000,000 poods, the sugar-beet crop from 654,000,000 poods to 1,311,000,000 poods, and the oil-seed crop from 129,000,000 poods to 306,000,000 poods. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It should be mentioned that in 1937 the collective farms alone (without the state farms) produced a marketable surplus of over 1,700,000,000 poods of grain, which was at least 400,000,000 poods more than the landlords, kulaks and peasants together marketed in 1913. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Only one branch of agriculture -- livestock farming -- still lagged behind the pre-war level and continued to progress at a slower rate. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As to collectivization in agriculture, it might be considered completed. The number of peasant households that had joined the collective farms by 1937 was 18,500,000 or 93 per cent of the total number of peasant households, while the grain crop area of the collective farms amounted to 99 per cent of the total grain crop area of the peasants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The fruits of the reconstruction of agriculture and of the extensive supply of tractors and machinery for agricultural purposes were now manifest. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As a result of the completion of the reconstruction of industry and agriculture the national economy was now abundantly supplied with first-class technique. Industry, agriculture, the transport system and the army had received huge quantities of modern technique -- machinery and machine tools, tractors and agricultural machines, locomotives and steamships, artillery and tanks, aeroplanes and warships. Tens and hundreds of thousands of trained people were required, people capable of harnessing all this technique and getting the most out of it. Without this, without a sufficient number of people who had mastered technique, there was a risk of technique becoming so much dead and unused metal. This was a serious danger, a result of the fact that the growth in the number of trained people, cadres, capable of harnessing, making full use of technique <I>was not keeping pace with</I>, and even <I>lagging far behind</I>, the spread of technique. Matters were further complicated by the fact that a considerable number of our industrial executives did not realize this danger and believed that technique would just "do the job by itself." Whereas, formerly, they had underrated the importance of technique and treated it with disdain, now they began to overrate it and turn it into a fetish. They did not realize that without people who had mastered technique, technique was a dead thing. They did not realize that 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 337</B></FONT><P>

to make technique highly productive, people who had mastered technique were required. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus the problem of cadres who had mastered technique became one of prime importance. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The executives who displayed an excessive zeal for technique and a consequent underestimation of the importance of trained people, cadres, had to have their attention turned to the study and mastery of technique, and to the necessity of doing everything to train numerous cadres capable of harnessing technique and getting the most out of it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Whereas formerly, at the beginning of the reconstruction period, when the country suffered from a dearth of technique, the Party had issued the slogan, "technique in the period of reconstruction decides everything," now, when there was an abundance of technique, when the reconstruction had in the main been completed, and when the country was experiencing an acute dearth of cadres, it became incumbent on the Party to issue a new slogan, one that would focus attention, not so much on technique, as on people, on cadres capable of utilizing technique to the full. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Of great importance in this respect was the <A HREF="../Stalin/GRA35.html">speech</A> made by Comrade Stalin to the graduates from the Red Army Academies in May 1935. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Formerly," said Comrade Stalin, "we used to say that 'technique decides everything.' This slogan helped us to put an end to the dearth in technique and to create a vast technical base in every branch of activity for the equipment of our people with first-class technique. That is very good. But it is not enough, it is not enough by far. In order to set technique going and to utilize it to the full, we need people who have mastered technique, we need cadres capable of mastering and utilizing this technique according to all the rules of the art. Without people who have mastered technique, technique is dead. In the charge of people who have mastered technique, technique can and should perform miracles. If in our first-class mills and factories, in our state farms and collective farms and in our Red Army we had sufficient cadres capable of harnessing this technique, our country would secure results three times and four times as great as at present. That is why emphasis must now be laid on people, on cadres, on workers who have mastered technique. That is why the old slogan, 'technique decides everything,' which is a reflection of a period already passed, a period in which we suffered from a dearth of technique, must now be replaced by a new slogan, the slogan '<I>cadres decide everything.</I>' That is the main thing now. . . . 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 338</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "It is time to realize that of all the valuable capital the world possesses, the most valuable and most decisive is people, cadres. It must be realized that under our present conditions '<I>cadres decide everything.</I>' If we have good and numerous cadres in industry, agriculture, transport and the army -- our country will be invincible. If we do not have such cadres -- we shall be lame on both legs." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus the prime task now was to accelerate the training of technical cadres and rapidly to master the new technique with the object of securing a continued rise in productivity of labour. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The most striking example of the growth of such cadres, of the mastering of the new technique by our people, and of the continued rise in productivity of labour was the Stakhanov movement. It originated and developed in the Donetz Basin, in the coal industry, and spread to other branches of industry, to the railways, and then to agriculture. It was called the Stakhanov movement after its originator, Alexei Stakhanov, a coal-hewer in the Central Irmino Colliery (Donetz Basin). Stakhanov had been preceded by Nikita Izotov, who had broken all previous records in coal hewing. On August 31, 1935, Stakhanov hewed 102 tons of coal in one shift and thus fulfilled the standard output fourteen times over. This inaugurated a mass movement of workers and collective farmers for raising the standards of output, for a new advance in productivity of labour. Busygin in the automobile industry, Smetanin in the shoe industry, Krivonoss on the railways, Musinsky in the timber industry, Evdokia Vinogradova and Maria Vinogradova in the textile industry, Maria Demchenko, Maria Gnatenko, P. Angelina, Polagutin, Kolesov, Borin and Kovardak in agriculture -- these were the first pioneers of the Stakhanov movement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    They were followed by other pioneers, whole battalions of them, who surpassed the productivity of labour of the earlier pioneers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Tremendous stimulus was given to the Stakhanov movement by the First All-Union Conference of Stakhanovites held in the Kremlin in November 1935, and by the <A HREF="../Stalin/SCS35.html">speech</A> Comrade Stalin made there. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The Stakhanov movement," Comrade Stalin said in this speech, "is the expression of a new wave of Socialist emulation, a new and higher stage of Socialist emulation. . . . In the past, some three years ago, in the period of the first stage of Socialist emulation, Socialist emulation was not necessarily associated with modern technique. At that time, in fact, we had hardly any modern technique. The present stage of Socialist emulation, the Stakhanov movement, on the other hand, is necessarily associated with modern

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 339</B></FONT><P>

technique. The Stakhanov movement would be inconceivable without a new and higher technique. We have before us people like Comrade Stakhanov, Busygin, Smetanin, Krivonoss, the Vinogradovas and many others, new people, working men and women, who have completely mastered the technique of their jobs, have harnessed it and driven ahead. We had no such people, or hardly any such people, some three years ago. . . . The significance of the Stakhanov movement lies in the fact that it is a movement which is smashing the old technical standards, because they are inadequate, which in a number of cases is surpassing the productivity of labour of the foremost capitalist countries, and is thus creating the practical possibility of further consolidating Socialism in our country, of converting our country into the most prosperous of all countries." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Describing the methods of work of the Stakhanovites, and bringing out the tremendous significance of the Stakhanov movement for the future of our country, Comrade Stalin went on to say: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Look at our comrades, the Stakhanovites, more closely. What type of people are they? They are mostly young or middle-aged working men and women, people with culture and technical knowledge, who show examples of precision and accuracy in work, who are able to appreciate the time factor in work and who have learned to count not only the minutes, but also the seconds. The majority of them have taken the technical minimum courses and are continuing their technical education. They are free of the conservatism and stagnation of certain engineers, technicians and business executives; they are marching boldly forward, smashing the antiquated technical standards and creating new and higher standards; they are introducing amendments into the designed capacities and economic plans drawn up by the leaders of our industry; they often supplement and correct what the engineers and technicians have to say, they often teach them and impel them forward, for they are people who have completely mastered the technique of their job and who are able to squeeze out of technique the maximum that can- be squeezed out of it. Today the Stakhanovites are still few in number, but who can doubt that tomorrow there will be ten times more of them? Is it not clear that the Stakhanovites are innovators in our industry, that the Stakhanov movement represents the future of our industry, that it contains the seed of the future rise in the cultural and technical level of the working class, that it opens to us the path by which alone can be achieved those 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 340</B></FONT><P>

high indices of productivity of labour which are essential for the transition from Socialism to Communism and for the elimination of the distinction between mental labour and manual labour." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The spread of the Stakhanov movement and the fulfillment of the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of time created the conditions for a new rise in the standard of welfare and culture of the working people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan real wages of workers and office employees had more than doubled. The total payroll increased from 34,000,000,000 rubles in 1933 to 81,000,000,000 rubles in 1937. The state social insurance fund increased from 4,600,000,000 rubles to 5,600,000,000 rubles in the same period. In 1937 alone, about 10,000,000,000 rubles were expended on the state insurance of workers and employees, on improving living conditions and on meeting cultural requirements, on sanatoria, health resorts, rest homes and on medical service. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In the countryside, the collective farm system had been definitely consolidated. This was greatly assisted by the <I>Rules of the Agricultural Artel</I>, adopted by the Second Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers in February 1935, and the assignment to the collective farms of the land cultivated by them <I>in perpetual tenure.</I> The consolidation of the collective farm system put an end to poverty and insecurity among the rural population. Whereas formerly, some three years earlier, the collective farmers had received one or two kilograms of grain per work-day-unit, now the majority of the collective farmers in the grain-growing regions were receiving from five to twelve kilograms, and many as much as twenty kilograms per work-day-unit, besides other kinds of produce and money income. There were millions of collective farm households in the grain-growing regions who now received as their yearly returns from 500 to 1,500 poods of grain, and in the cotton, sugar beet, flax, livestock, grape growing, citrus fruit growing and fruit and vegetable growing regions, tens of thousands of rubles in annual income. The collective farms had become prosperous. It was now the chief concern of the household of a collective farmer to build new granaries and storehouses, inasmuch as the old storage places, which were designed for a meagre annual supply, no longer met even one-tenth of the household's requirements. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In 1936, in view of the rising standard of welfare of the people, the government passed a law prohibiting abortion, at the same time adopting an extensive program for the building of maternity homes, nurseries, milk centres and kindergartens. In 1936, 2,174,000,000 rubles were assigned for these measures, as compared with 875,000,000 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 341</B></FONT><P>

rubles in 1935. A law was passed providing for considerable grants to large families. Grants to a total of over 1,000,000,000 rubles were made in 1937 under this law. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The introduction of universal compulsory education and the building of new schools led to the rapid cultural progress of the people. Schools were built in large numbers all over the country. The number of pupils in elementary and intermediate schools increased from 8,000,000 in 1914 to 28,000,000 in the school year 1936-37. The number of university students increased from 112,000 to 542,000 in the same period. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a veritable cultural revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The rise in the standard of welfare and culture of the masses was a reflection of the strength, might and invincibility of our Soviet revolution. Revolutions in the past perished because, while giving the people freedom, they were unable to bring about any serious improvement in their material and cultural conditions. Therein lay their chief weakness. Our revolution differs from all other revolutions in that it not only freed the people from tsardom and capitalism, but also brought about a radical improvement in the welfare and cultural condition of the people. Therein lies its strength and invincibility. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Our proletarian revolution," said Comrade Stalin at the First All-Union Conference of Stakhanovites, "is the only revolution in the world which had the opportunity of showing the people not only political results but also material results. Of all workers' revolutions we know only one which managed to achieve power. That was the Paris Commune. But it did not last long. True, it endeavoured to smash the fetters of capitalism, but it did not have time enough to smash them, and still less to show the people the beneficial material results of revolution. Our revolution is the only one which not only smashed the fetters of capitalism and brought the people freedom, but also succeeded in creating the material conditions of a prosperous life for the people. Therein lies the strength and invincibility of our revolution."

EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS. ADOPTION OF THE NEW CON-<BR>
STITUTION OF THE U.S.S.R.<BR> 
</FONT></B>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In February 1935, the Seventh Congress of Soviets of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics passed a decision to change the Constitution of the U.S.S.R. which had been adopted in 1924. The change of the Constitution was necessitated by the vast changes that had taken 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 342</B></FONT><P>

place in the life of the U.S.S.R. since the first Constitution of the Soviet Union had been adopted in 1924.  During this period the relation of class forces within the country had completely changed; a new Socialist industry had been created, the kulaks had been smashed, the collective farm system had triumphed, and the Socialist ownership of the means of production had been established in every branch of national economy as the basis of Soviet society. The victory of Socialism made possible the further democratization of the electoral system and the introduction of universal, equal and direct suffrage with secret ballot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The new Constitution of the U.S.S.R. was drafted by a Constitution Commission set up for the purpose, under the chairmanship of Comrade Stalin. The draft was thrown open to nationwide discussion, which lasted five and a half months. It was then submitted to the Extraordinary Eighth Congress of Soviets. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Eighth Congress of Soviets, specially convened to approve or reject the draft of the new Constitution of the U.S.S.R., met in November 1936. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp                                                   
    Reporting to the congress on the draft of the new Constitution, Comrade Stalin enumerated the principal changes that had taken place in the Soviet Union since the adoption of the 1924 Constitution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The 1924 Constitution had been drawn up in the early period of NEP. At that time the Soviet Government still permitted the development of capitalism alongside of the development of Socialism. The Soviet Government planned in the course of competition between the two systems -- the capitalist system and the Socialist system -- to organize and ensure the victory of Socialism over capitalism in the economic field. The question, "Who will win?" had not yet been settled. Industry, with its old and inadequate technical equipment, had not attained even the pre-war level. Even less enviable was the picture presented by agriculture. The state farms and collective farms were mere islands in a boundless ocean of individual peasant farms. The question then was not of eliminating the kulaks, but merely of restricting them. The Socialist sector accounted for only about 50 per cent of the country's trade. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Entirely different was the picture presented by the U.S.S.R. in 1936. By that time the economic life of the country had undergone a complete change. The capitalist elements had been entirely eliminated and the Socialist system had triumphed in all spheres of economic life. There was now a powerful Socialist industry which had increased output seven times compared with the pre-war output and had completely ousted private industry. Mechanized Socialist farming in the form of collective 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 343</B></FONT><P>

farms and state farms, equipped with up-to-date machinery and run on the largest scale in the world, had triumphed in agriculture. By 1936, the kulaks had been completely eliminated as a class, and the individual peasants no longer played any important role in the economic life of the country. Trade was entirely concentrated in the hands of the state and the co-operatives. The exploitation of man by man had been abolished forever. Public, Socialist ownership of the means of production had been firmly established as the unshakable foundation of the new, Socialist system in all branches of economic life. In the new, Socialist society, crises, poverty, unemployment and destitution had disappeared forever. The conditions had been created for a prosperous and cultured life for all members of Soviet society. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The class composition of the population of the Soviet Union, said Comrade Stalin in his report, had changed correspondingly. The landlord class and the old big imperialist bourgeoisie had already been eliminated in the period of the Civil War. During the years of Socialist construction all the exploiting elements -- capitalists, merchants, kulaks and profiteers -- had been eliminated. Only insignificant remnants of the eliminated exploiting classes persisted, and their complete elimination was a matter of the very near future. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The working people of the U.S.S.R. -- workers, peasants and intellectuals -- had undergone profound change in the period of Socialist construction. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The working class had ceased to be an exploited class bereft of means of production, as it is under capitalism. It had abolished capitalism, taken away the means of production from the capitalists and turned them into public property. It had ceased to be a proletariat in the proper, the old meaning of the term. The proletariat of the U.S.S.R., possessing the state power, had been transformed into an entirely new class. It had become a working class emancipated from exploitation, a working class which had abolished the capitalist economic system and had established Socialist ownership of the means of production. Hence, it was a working class the like of which the history of mankind had never known before. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    No less profound were the changes that had taken place in the condition of the peasantry of the U.S.S.R. In the old days, over twenty million scattered individual peasant households, small and middle, had delved away in isolation on their small plots, using backward technical equipment. They were exploited by landlords, kulaks, merchants, profiteers, usurers, etc. Now an entirely new peasantry had grown up in the U.S.S.R. There were no longer any landlords, kulaks, merchants 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 344</B></FONT><P>

and usurers to exploit the peasants. The overwhelming majority of the peasant households had joined the collective farms, which were based not on private ownership, but on collective ownership of the means of production, collective ownership which had grown from collective labour. This was a new type of peasantry, a peasantry emancipated from all exploitation. It was a peasantry the like of which the history of mankind had never known before. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The intelligentsia in the U.S.S.R. had also undergone a change. It had for the most part become an entirely new intelligentsia. The majority of its members came from the ranks of the workers and peasants. It no longer served capitalism, as the old intelligentsia did; it served Socialism. It had become an equal member of the Socialist society. Together with the workers and peasants, it was building a new Socialist society. This was a new type of intelligentsia, which served the people and was emancipated from all exploitation. It was an intelligentsia the like of which the history of mankind had never known before. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Thus the old class dividing lines between the working people of the U.S.S.R. were being obliterated, the old class exclusiveness was disappearing. The economic and political contradictions between the workers, the peasants and the intellectuals were declining and becoming obliterated. The foundation for the moral and political unity of society had been created. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These profound changes in the life of the U.S.S.R., these decisive achievements of Socialism in the U.S.S.R., were reflected in the new Constitution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    According to the new Constitution, Soviet society consists of two friendly classes -- the workers and peasants -- class distinctions between the two still remaining. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a Socialist state of workers and peasants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The political foundation of the U.S.S.R. is formed by the Soviets of Deputies of the Working People, which developed and grew strong as a result of the overthrow of the power of the landlords and capitalists and the achievement of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    All power in the U.S.S.R. belongs to the working people of town and country as represented by the Soviets of Deputies of the Working People. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The highest organ of state power in the U.S.S.R. is the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., consisting of two Chambers with equal rights, the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 345</B></FONT><P>

is elected by the citizens of the U.S.S.R. for a term of four years on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., as to all Soviets of Deputies of the Working People, are <I>universal.</I> This means that all citizens of the U.S.S.R. who have reached the age of eighteen, irrespective of race or nationality, religion, standard of education, domicile, social origin, property status or past activities, have the right to vote in the election of deputies and to be elected, with the exception of the insane and persons convicted by court of law to sentences including deprivation of electoral rights. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Elections of deputies are <I>equal.</I> This means that each citizen is entitled to one vote and that all citizens participate in the elections on an equal footing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Elections of deputies are <I>direct.</I> This means that all Soviets of Deputies of the Working People, from rural and city Soviets of Deputies of the Working People up to and including the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., are elected by the citizens by direct vote. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. at a joint sitting of both Chambers elects the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of People's Commissars of the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The economic foundation of the U.S.S.R. is the Socialist system of economy and the Socialist ownership of the means of production. In the U.S.S.R. is realized the Socialist principle: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his work." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All citizens of the U.S.S.R. are guaranteed the right to work, the right to rest and leisure, the right to education, the right to maintenance in old age and in case of sickness or disability. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Women are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of life. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The equality of the citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their nationality or race, is an indefeasible law. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Freedom of conscience and freedom of anti-religious propaganda is recognized for all citizens. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In order to strengthen Socialist society, the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press, assembly and meeting, the right to unite in public organizations, inviolability of person, inviolability of domicile and privacy of correspondence, the right of asylum for foreign citizens persecuted for defending the interests of the working people or for their scientific activities, or for their struggle for national liberation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The new Constitution also imposes serious duties on all citizens of the U.S.S.R.: the duty of observing the laws, maintaining labour discipline, honestly performing public duties, respecting the rules of the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 346</B></FONT><P>

Socialist community, safeguarding and strengthening public, Socialist property, and defending the Socialist fatherland. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "To defend the fatherland is the sacred duty of every citizen of the U.S.S.R." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Dealing with the right of citizens to unite in various societies, one of the articles of the Constitution states: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The most active and politically conscious citizens in the ranks of the working class and other strata of the working people unite in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), which is the vanguard of the working people in their struggle to strengthen and develop the Socialist system and which represents the leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Eighth Congress of Soviets unanimously approved and adopted the draft of the new Constitution of the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Soviet country thus acquired a new Constitution, a Constitution embodying the victory of Socialism and workers' and peasants' democracy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
   In this way the Constitution gave legislative embodiment to the epoch-making fact that the U.S.S.R. had entered a new stage of development, the stage of the completion of the building of a Socialist society and the gradual transition to Communist society, where the guiding principle of social life will be the Communist principle: "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In 1937, new facts came to light regarding the fiendish crimes of the Bukharin-Trotsky gang. The trial of Pyatakov, Radek and others, the trial of Tukhachevsky, Yakir and others, and, lastly, the trial of Bukharin, Rykov, Krestinsky, Rosengoltz and others, all showed that the Bukharinites and Trotskyites had long ago joined to form a common band of enemies of the people, operating as the "Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The trials showed that these dregs of humanity, in conjunction with

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 347</B></FONT><P>

the enemies of the people, Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev, had been in conspiracy against Lenin, the Party and the Soviet state ever since the early days of the October Socialist Revolution. The insidious attempts to thwart the Peace of Brest-Litovsk at the beginning of 1918 the plot against Lenin and the conspiracy with the "Left" Socialist-Revolutionaries for the arrest and murder of Lenin, Stalin and Sverdlov in the spring of 1918, the villainous shot that wounded Lenin in the summer of 1918, the revolt of the "Left" Socialist-Revolutionaries in the summer of 1918, the deliberate aggravation of differences in the Party in 1921 with the object of undermining and overthrowing Lenin's leadership from within, the attempts to overthrow the Party leadership during Lenin's illness and after his death, the betrayal of state secrets and the supply of information of an espionage character to foreign espionage services, the vile assassination of Kirov, the acts of wrecking, diversion and explosions, the dastardly murder of Menzhinsky, Kuibyshev and Gorky -- all these and similar villainies over a period of twenty years were committed, it transpired, with the participation or under the direction of Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Rykov and their henchmen, at the behest of espionage services of bourgeois states. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The trials brought to light the fact that the Trotsky-Bukharin fiends, in obedience to the wishes of their masters -- the espionage services of foreign states -- had set out to destroy the Party and the Soviet state, to undermine the defensive power of the country, to assist foreign military intervention, to prepare the way for the defeat of the Red Army, to bring about the dismemberment of the U.S.S.R., to hand over the Soviet Maritime Region to the Japanese, Soviet Byelorussia to the Poles, and the Soviet Ukraine to the Germans, to destroy the gains of the workers and collective farmers, and to restore capitalist slavery in the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  These Whiteguard pigmies, whose strength was no more than that of a gnat, apparently flattered themselves that they were the masters of the country, and imagined that it was really in their power to sell or give away the Ukraine, Byelorussia and the Maritime Region. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   These Whiteguard insects forgot that the real masters of the Soviet country were the Soviet people, and that the Rykovs, Bukharins, Zinovievs and Kamenevs were only temporary employees of the state, which could at any moment sweep them out from its offices as so much useless rubbish. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These contemptible lackeys of the fascists forgot that the Soviet people had only to move a finger, and not a trace of them would be left. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 348</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Soviet court sentenced the Bukharin-Trotsky fiends to be shot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs carried out the sentence. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Soviet people approved the annihilation of the Bukharin-Trotsky gang and passed on to next business. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     And the next business was to prepare for the election of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. and to carry it out in an organized way. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Party threw all its strength into the preparations for the elections. It held that the putting into effect of the new Constitution of the U.S.S.R. signified a turn in the political life of the country. This turn meant the complete democratization of the electoral system, the substitution of universal suffrage for restricted suffrage, equal suffrage for not entirely equal suffrage, direct elections for indirect elections, and secret ballot for open ballot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Before the introduction of the new Constitution there were restrictions of the franchise in the case of priests, former Whiteguards, former kulaks, and persons not engaged in useful labour. The new Constitution abolished all franchise restrictions for these categories of citizens by making the election of deputies universal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Formerly, the election of deputies had been unequal, inasmuch as the bases of representation for the urban and rural populations differed. Now, however, all necessity for restrictions of equality of the suffrage had disappeared and all citizens were given the right to take part in the elections on an equal footing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Formerly, the elections of the intermediate and higher organs of Soviet power were indirect. Now, however, under the new Constitution, all Soviets, from rural and urban up to and including the Supreme Soviet, were to be elected by the citizens directly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Formerly, deputies to the Soviets were elected by open ballot and the voting was for lists of candidates. Now, however, the voting for  deputies was to be by secret ballot, and not by lists, but for individual candidates nominated in each electoral area. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a definite turning point in the political life of the country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The new electoral system was bound to result, and actually did result, in an enhancement of the political activity of the people, in greater control by the masses over the organs of Soviet power, and in the increased responsibility of the organs of Soviet power to the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In order to be fully prepared for this turn, the Party had to be its moving spirit, and the leading role of the Party in the forthcoming elections had to be fully ensured. But this could be done only if the Party organizations themselves became thoroughly democratic in their everyday 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 349</B></FONT><P>

work, only if they fully observed the principles of democratic centralism in their inner-Party life, as the Party Rules demanded, only if all organs of the Party were elected, only if criticism and self-criticism in the Party were developed to the full, only if the responsibility of the Party bodies to the members of the Party were complete, and if the members of the Party themselves became thoroughly active. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    A report made by Comrade Zhdanov at the plenum of the Central Committee at the end of February 1937 on the subject of preparing the Party organizations for the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. revealed the fact that a number of Party organizations were systematically violating the Party Rules and the principles of democratic centralism in their everyday work, substituting co-option for election, voting by lists for the voting for individual candidates, open ballot for secret ballot, etc. It was obvious that organizations in which such practices prevailed could not properly fulfil their tasks in the elections to the Supreme Soviet. It was therefore first of all necessary to put a stop to such anti-democratic practices in the Party organizations and to reorganize Party work on broad democratic lines. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Accordingly, after hearing the report of Comrade Zhdanov, the Plenum of the Central Committee resolved: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "a)&nbsp;To reorganize Party work on the basis of complete and unqualified observance of the principles of inner-Party democracy as prescribed by the Party Rules. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    "b)&nbsp;To put an end to the practice of co-opting members of Party Committees and to restore the principle of election of directing bodies of Party organizations as prescribed by the Party Rules. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    "c)&nbsp;To forbid voting by lists in the election of Party bodies; voting should be for individual candidates, all members of the Party being guaranteed the unlimited right to challenge candidates and to criticize them. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    "d)&nbsp;To introduce the secret ballot in the election of Party bodies. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    "e)&nbsp;To hold elections of Party bodies in all Party organizations, from the Party Committees of primary Party organizations to the territorial and regional committees and the Central Committees of the national Communist Parties, the elections to be completed not later than May 20. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    "f)&nbsp;To charge all Party organizations strictly to observe the provisions of the Party Rules with respect to the terms of office of Party bodies, namely: to hold elections in primary Party organizations once a year; in district and city organizations -- once a year; 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 350</B></FONT><P>

in regional, territorial and republican organizations -- every eighteen months.                                    

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   "g)&nbsp;To ensure that Party organizations strictly adhere to the system of electing Party Committees at general factory meetings, and not to allow the latter to be replaced by delegate conferences. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    "h)&nbsp;To put a stop to the practice prevalent in a number of primary Party organizations whereby general meetings are virtually abolished and replaced by shop meetings and delegate conferences." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    In this way the Party began its preparations for the forthcoming elections. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This decision of the Central Committee was of tremendous political importance. Its significance lay not only in the fact that it inaugurated the Party's campaign in the election of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., but also, and primarily, in the fact that it helped the Party organizations to reorganize their work, to apply the principles of inner-Party democracy, and to meet the elections to the Supreme Soviet fully prepared. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Party decided to make the idea of an election bloc of Communists and the non-Party masses the keynote of its policy in developing the election campaign. The Party entered the elections in a bloc, an alliance with the non-Party masses, by deciding to put up in the electoral areas joint candidates with the non-Party masses. This was something unprecedented and absolutely impossible in elections in bourgeois countries. But a bloc of Communists and the non-Party masses was something quite natural in our country, where hostile classes no longer exist and where the moral and political unity of all sections of the population is an incontestable fact. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On December 7, 1937, the Central Committee of the Party issued an Address to the electors, which stated: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "On December 12, 1937, the working people of the Soviet Union will, on the basis of our Socialist Constitution, elect their deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. The Bolshevik Party enters the elections in a <I>bloc</I>, an <I>alliance</I> with the non-Party workers, peasants, office employees and intellectuals. . . . The Bolshevik Party does not fence itself off from non-Party people, but, on the contrary, enters the elections in a bloc, an alliance, with the non-Party masses, in a bloc with the trade unions of the workers and office employees, with the Young Communist League and other non-Party organizations and societies. Consequently, the candidates will be the joint candidates of the Communists and the non-Party masse 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 351</B></FONT><P>

every non-Party deputy will also be the deputy of the Communists, just as every Communist deputy will be the deputy of the non-Party masses." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Address of the Central Committee concluded with the following appeal to the electors: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls upon all Communists and sympathizers to vote for the non-Party candidates with the same unanimity as they should vote for the Communist candidates. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls upon all non-Party electors to vote for the Communist candidates with the same unanimity as they will vote for the non-Party candidates. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls upon all electors to appear at the polling stations on December 12, 1937, as one man, to elect the deputies to the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "There must not be a single elector who does not exercise his honourable right of electing deputies to the Supreme organ of the Soviet state. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "There must not be a single active citizen who does not consider it his civic duty to assist in ensuring that all electors without exception take part in the elections of the Supreme Soviet. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "December 12, 1937, should be a great holiday celebrating the union of the working people of all the nations of the U.S.S.R. around the victorious banner of Lenin and Stalin." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   On December 1, 1937, the eve of the elections, Comrade Stalin addressed the voters of the area in which he was nominated and described what type of public figures those whom the people choose, the deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., should be. Comrade Stalin said: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The electors, the people, must demand that their deputies should remain equal to their tasks; that in their work they should not sink to the level of political philistines; that in their posts they should remain political figures of the Lenin type; that as public figures they should be as clear and definite as Lenin was; that they should be as fearless in battle and as merciless towards the enemies of the people as Lenin was; that they should be free from all panic, from any semblance of panic, when things begin to get complicated and 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 352</B></FONT><P>

some danger or other looms on the horizon, that they should be as free from all semblance of panic as Lenin was; that they should be as wise and deliberate in deciding complex problems requiring a comprehensive orientation and a comprehensive weighing of all pros and cons as Lenin was; that they should be as upright and honest as Lenin was; that they should love their people as Lenin did." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The elections to the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. took place on December 12 amidst great enthusiasm. They were something more than elections; they were a great holiday celebrating the triumph of the Soviet people, a demonstration of the great friendship of the peoples of the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Of a total of 94,000,000 electors, over 91,000,000, or 96.8 per cent, voted. Of this number 89,844,000, or 98.6 per cent, voted for the candidates of the bloc of the Communists and the non-Party masses. Only 632,000 persons, or less than one per cent, voted against the candidates of the bloc of the Communists and the non-Party masses. All the candidates of the bloc were elected without exception. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Thus, 90,000,000 persons, by their unanimous vote, confirmed the victory of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    This was a remarkable victory for the bloc of the Communists and the non-Party masses. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It was a triumph for the Bolshevik Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It was a brilliant confirmation of the moral and political unity of the Soviet people, to which Comrade Molotov had referred in a historic speech he delivered on the occasion of the Twentieth Anniversary of the October Revolution.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What are the chief conclusions to be drawn from the historical path traversed by the Bolshevik Party? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    What does the history of the C.P.S.U.(B.) teach us? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     1)&nbsp;The history of the Party teaches us, first of all, that the victory of the proletarian revolution, the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, is impossible without a revolutionary party of the proletariat, a party free from opportunism, irreconcilable towards compromisers and capitulators, and revolutionary in its attitude towards the bourgeoisie and its state power. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The history of the Party teaches us that to leave the proletariat without such a party means to leave it without revolutionary leadership; and to leave it without revolutionary leadership means to ruin the cause of the proletarian revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The history of the Party teaches us that the ordinary Social-Democratic Party of the West-European type, brought up under conditions of civil peace, trailing in the wake of the opportunists, dreaming of "social reforms," and dreading social revolution, cannot be such a party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The history of the Party teaches us that only a party of the new type, a Marxist-Leninist party, a party of social revolution, a party capable of preparing the proletariat for decisive battles against the bourgeoisie and of organizing the victory of the proletarian revolution, can be such a party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Bolshevik Party in the U.S.S.R. is such a party. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     "In the pre-revolutionary period," Comrade Stalin says, "in the period of more or less peaceful development, when the parties of the Second International were the predominant force in the working-class movement and parliamentary forms of struggle were regarded as the principal forms, the party neither had nor could have had that great and decisive importance which it acquired afterwards, under conditions of open revolutionary battle. Defending the Second International against attacks made upon it, Kautsky says that the parties of the Second International are instruments of peace and not of war, and that for this very reason they were powerless to take any

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 354</B></FONT><P>

important steps during the war, during the period of revolutionary action by the proletariat. That is quite true. But what does it mean? It means that the parties of the Second International are unfit for the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, that they are not miltant parties of the proletariat, leading the workers to power, but election machines adapted for parliamentary elections and parliamentary struggle. This, in fact, explains why, in the days when the opportunists of the Second International were in the ascendancy, it was not the party but its parliamentary group that was the chief political organization of the proletariat. It is well known that the party at that time was really an appendage and subsidiary of the parliamentary group. It goes without saying that under such circumstances and with such a party at the helm there could be no question of preparing the proletariat for revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "But matters have changed radically with the dawn of the new period. The new period is one of open class collisions, of revolutionary action by the proletariat, of proletarian revolution, a period when forces are being directly mustered for the overthrow of imperialism and the seizure of power by the proletariat. In this period the proletariat is confronted with new tasks, the tasks of reorganizing all party work on new, revolutionary lines; of educating the workers in the spirit of revolutionary struggle for power; of preparing and moving up reserves; of establishing an alliance with the proletarians of neighbouring countries; of establishing firm ties with the liberation movement in the colonies and dependent countries, etc., etc. To think that these new tasks can be performed by the old Social-Democratic parties, brought up as they were in the peaceful conditions of parliamentarism, is to doom oneself to hopeless despair and inevitable defeat. If, with such tasks to shoulder, the proletariat remained under the leadership of the old parties it would be completely unarmed and defenceless. It goes without saying that the proletariat could not consent to such a state of affairs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "Hence the necessity for a new party, a militant party, a revolutionary party, one bold enough to lead the proletarians in the struggle for power, sufficiendy experienced to find its bearings amidst the complex conditions of a revolutionary situation, and sufficiendy fiexible to steer clear of all submerged rocks in the path to its goal. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp

    2)&nbsp;The history of the Party further teaches us that a party of the working class cannot perform the role of leader of its class, cannot perform the role of organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution, unless it has mastered the advanced theory of the working-class movement, the Marxist-Leninist theory. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The power of the Marxist-Leninist theory lies in the fact that it enables the Party to find the right orientation in any situation, to understand the inner connection of current events, to foresee their course and to perceive not only how and in what direction they are developing in the present, but how and in what direction they are bound to develop in the future. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Only a party which has mastered the Marxist-Leninist theory can confidently advance and lead the working class forward. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On the other hand, a party which has not mastered the Marxist-Leninist theory is compelled to grope its way, loses confidence in its actions and is unable to lead the working class forward. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It may seem that all that is required for mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory is diligendy to learn by heart isolated conclusions and propositions from the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin, learn to quote them at opportune times and rest at that, in the hope that the conclusions and propositions thus memorized will suit each and every situation and occasion. But such an approach to the Marxist-Leninist theory is altogether wrong. The Marxist-Leninist theory must not be regarded as a collection of dogmas, as a catechism, as a symbol of faith, and the Marxists themselves as pedants and dogmatists. The Marxist-Leninist theory is the science of the development of society, the science of the working-class movement, the science of the proletarian revolution, the science of the building of the Communist society. And as a science it does not and cannot stand still, but develops and perfects itself. Clearly, in its development it is bound to become enriched by new experience and new knowledge, and some of its propositions and conclusions are bound to change in the course of time, are bound to be replaced by new conclusions and propositions corresponding to the new historical conditions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory does not at all mean learning all its formulas and conclusions by heart and clinging to their every letter. To master the Marxist-Leninist theory we must first of all learn to distinguish between its letter and substance. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory means assimilating <I>the substance</I> of this theory and learning to use it in the solution of the practical problems of the revolutionary movement under the varying conditions of the class struggle of the proletariat. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 356</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Mastering the Marxist-Leninist theory means being able to enrich this theory with the new experience of the revolutionary movement, with new propositions and conclusions, it means being able to <I>develop it and advance it</I> without hesitating to replace -- in accordance with the substance of the theory -- such of its propositions and conclusions as have become antiquated by new ones corresponding to the new historical situation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Marxist-Leninist theory is not a dogma but a guide to action. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Before the Second Russian Revolution (February I917), the Marxists of all countries assumed that the parliamentary democratic republic was the most suitable form of political organization of society in the period of transition from capitalism to Socialism. It is true that in the seventies Marx stated that the most suitable form for the dictatorship of the proletariat was a political organization of the type of the Paris Commune, and not the parliamentary republic. But, unfortunately, Marx did not develop this proposition any further in his writings and it was committed to oblivion. Moreover, Engels' authoritative statement in his criticism of the draft of the Erfurt Program in I891, namely, that "the democratic republic . . . is . . . the specific form for the dictatorship of the proletariat" left no doubt that the Marxists continued to regard the democratic republic as the political form for the dictatorship of the proletariat. Engels' proposition later became a guiding principle for all Marxists, including Lenin. However, the Russian Revolution of 1905, and especially the Revolution of February I9I7, advanced a new form of political organization of society -- the Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies. As a result of a study of the experience of the two Russian revolutions, Lenin, on the basis of the theory of Marxism, arrived at the conclusion that the best political form for the dictatorship of the proletariat was not a parliamentary democratic republic, but a republic of Soviets. Proceeding from this, Lenin, in April I9I7, during the period of transition from the bourgeois to the Socialist revolution, issued the slogan of a republic of Soviets as the best political form for the dictatorship of the proletariat. The opportunists of all countries clung to the parliamentary republic and accused Lenin of departing from Marxism and destroying democracy. But it was Lenin, of course, who was the real Marxist who had mastered the theory of Marxism, and not the opportunists, for Lenin was advancing the Marxist theory by enriching it with new experience, whereas the opportunists were dragging it back and transforming one of its propositions into a dogma. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    What would have happened to the Party, to our revolution, to Marxism, if Lenin had been overawed by the letter of Marxism and had not 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 357</B></FONT><P>

had the courage to replace one of the old propositions of Marxism, for mulated by Engels, by the new proposition regarding the republic of Soviets, a proposition that corresponded to the new historical conditions? The Party would have groped in the dark, the Soviets would have been disorganized, we should not have had a Soviet power, and the Marxist theory would have suffered a severe setback. The proletariat would have lost, and the enemies of the proletariat would have won. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    As a result of a study of pre-imperialist capitalism Engels and Marx arrived at the conclusion that the Socialist revolution could not be victorious in one country, taken singly, that it could be victorious only by a simultaneous stroke in all, or the majority of the civilized countries. That was in the middle of the nineteenth century. This conclusion later became a guiding principle for all Marxists. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, pre-imperialist capitalism had grown into imperialist capitalism, ascendant capitalism had turned into moribund capitalism. As a result of a study of imperialist capitalism, Lenin, on the basis of the Marxist theory, arrived at the conclusion that the old formula of Engels and Marx no longer corresponded to the new historical conditions, and that the victory of the Socialist revolution was quite possible in one country, taken singly. The opportunists of all countries clung to the old formula of Engels and Marx and accused Lenin of departing from Marxism. But it was Lenin, of course, who was the real Marxist who had mastered the theory of Marxism, and not the opportunists, for Lenin was advancing the Marxist theory by enriching it with new experience, whereas the opportunists were dragging it back, mummifying it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    What would have happened to the Party, to our revolution, to Marxism, if Lenin had been overawed by the letter of Marxism and had not had the courage of theoretical conviction to discard one of the old conclusions of Marxism and to replace it by a new conclusion affirming that the victory of Socialism in one country, taken singly, was possible, a conclusion which corresponded to the new historical conditions? The Party would have groped in the dark, the proletarian revolution would have been deprived of leadership, and the Marxist theory would have begun to decay. The proletariat would have lost, and the enemies of the proletariat would have won. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Opportunism does not always mean a direct denial of the Marxist theory or of any of its propositions and conclusions. Opportunism is sometimes expressed in the attempt to cling to certain of the propositions of Marxism that have already become antiquated and to convert them into a dogma, so as to retard the further development of Marxism, and, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 358</B></FONT><P>

consequently, to retard the development of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    It may be said without fear of exaggeration that since the death of Engels the master theoretician Lenin, and after Lenin, Stalin and the other disciples of Lenin, have been the only Marxists who have advanced the Marxist theory and who have enriched it with new experience in the new conditions of the class struggle of the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And just because Lenin and the Leninists have advanced the Marxist theory, Leninism is a further development of Marxism; it is Marxism in the new conditions of the class struggle of the proletariat, Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and proletarian revolutions, Marxism of the epoch of the victory of Socialism on one-sixth of the earth's surface. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The Bolshevik Party could not have won in October I9I7 if its foremost men had not mastered the theory of Marxism, if they had not learned to regard this theory as a guide to action, if they had not learned to advance the Marxist theory by enriching it with the new experience of the class struggle of the proletariat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Criticizing the German Marxists in America who had undertaken to lead the American working-class movement, Engels wrote: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The Germans have not understood how to use their theory as a lever which could set the American masses in motion; they do not understand the theory themselves for the most part and treat it in a doctrinaire and dogmatic way, as something which has got to be learned off by heart and which will then supply all needs without more ado. To them it is a dogma and not a guide to action." (Marx and Engels, <I>Selected Correspondence</I>, pp. 449-450.)

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Criticizing Kamenev and some of the old Bolsheviks who in April I917 clung to the old formula of a revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry at a time when the revolutionary movement had gone on ahead and was demanding a transition to the Socialist revolution, Lenin wrote: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Our teaching is not a dogma, but a guide to action, Marx and Engels always used to say, rightly ridiculing the learning and repetition by rote of 'formulas' which at best are only capable of outlining general tasks that are necessarily liable to be modified by the concrete economic and political conditions of each separate phase of the historical process. . . . It is essential to realize the incontestable truth that a Marxist must take cognizance of real life, of the concrete realities, and must not continue to cling to a theory of yesterday. . . ."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    3)&nbsp;The history of the Party further teaches us that unless the petty-bourgeois parties which are active within the ranks of the working class and which push the backward sections of the working class into the arms of the bourgeoisie, thus splitting the unity of the working class, are smashed, the victory of the proletarian revolution is impossible. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The history of our Party is the history of the struggle against the petty-bourgeois parties -- the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, Anarchists and nationalists -- and of the utter defeat of these parties. If these parties had not been vanquished and driven out of the ranks of the working class, the unity of the working class could not have been achieved; and if the working class had not been united, it would have been impossible to achieve the victory of the proletarian revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     If these parties, which at first stood for the preservation of capitalism, and later, after the October Revolution, for the restoration of capitalism, had not been utterly defeated, it would have been impossible to preserve the dictatorship of the proletariat, to defeat the foreign armed intervention, and to build up Socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It cannot be regarded as an accident that all the petty-bourgeois parties, which styled themselves "revolutionary" and "socialist" parties in order to deceive the people -- the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, Anarchists and nationalists -- became counter-revolutionary parties even before the October Socialist Revolution, and later turned into agents of foreign bourgeois espionage services, into a gang of spies, wreckers, diversionists, assassins and traitors to the country. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>

   "The unity of the proletariat in the epoch of social revolution," Lenin says, "can be achieved only by the extreme revolutionary party of Marxism, and only by a relentless struggle against all other parties." (Lenin, <I>Collected Works</I>, Russ. ed., Vol. XXVI, p. 50.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    4)&nbsp;The history of the Party further teaches us that unless the Party of the working class wages an uncompromising struggle against the opportunists within its own ranks, unless it smashcs the capitulators in its own midst, it cannot preserve unity and discipline within its ranks, it cannot perforrn its role of organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution, nor its role as the builder of the new, Socialist society. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The history of the development of the internal life of our Party is the history of the struggle against the opportunist groups within the Party -- the "Economists," Mensheviks, Trotskyites, Bukharinites and nationalist deviators -- and of the utter defeat of these groups. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The history of our Party teaches us that all these groups of capitulators were in point of fact agents of Menshevism within our Party, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 360</B></FONT><P>

the lees and dregs of Menshevism, the continuers of Menshevism. Like the Mensheviks, they acted as vehicles of bourgeois influence among the working class and in the Party. The struggle for the liquidation of these groups within the Party was therefore a continuation of the struggle for the liquidation of Menshevism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     If we had not defeated the "Economists" and the Mensheviks, we could not have built the Party and led the working class to the proletarian revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     If we had not defeated the Trotskyites and Bukharinites, we could not have brought about the conditions that are essential for the building of Socialism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     If we had not defeated the nationalist deviators of all shades and colours, we could not have educated the people in the spirit of internationalism, we could not have safeguarded the banner of the great amity of the nations of the U.S.S.R., and we could not have built up the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It may seem to some that the Bolsheviks devoted far too much time to this struggle against the opportunist elements within the Party, that they overrated their importance. But that is altogether wrong. Opportunism in our midst is like an ulcer in a healthy organism, and must not be tolerated. The Party is the leading detachment of the working class, its advanced fortress, its general staff. Sceptics, opportunists, capitulators and traitors cannot be tolerated on the directing staff of the working class. If, while it is carrying on a life and death fight against the bourgeoisie, there are capitulators and traitors on its own staff, within its own fortress, the working class will be caught between two fires, from the front and the rear. Clearly, such a struggle can only end in defeat. The easiest way to capture a fortress is from within. To attain victory, the Party of the working class, its directing staff, its advanced fortress, must first be purged of capitulators, deserters, scabs and traitors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It cannot be regarded as an accident that the Trotskyites, Bukharinites and natlonalist deviators who fought Lenin and the Party ended just as the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties did, namely, by becoming agents of fascist espionage services, by turning spies, wreckers, assassins, diversionists and traitors to the country.

     "With reformists, Mensheviks, in our ranks," Lenin said, "it is <I>impossible</I> to achieve victory in the proletarian revolution, it is <I>impossible</I> to retain it. That is obvious in principle, and it has been strikingly confirmed by the experience both of Russia and Hungary. . . . In Russia, difficult situations have arisen many times, when the Soviet regime would most certainly have been overthrown had Men-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 361</B></FONT><P>

sheviks, reformists and petty-bourgeois democrats remained in our Party. . . ." (Lenin, <I>Collected Works</I>, Russ. ed., Vol. XXV, pp. 462-63.)  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Our Party," Comrade Stalin says, "succeeded in creating internal unity and unexampled cohesion of its ranks primarily because it was able in good time to purge itself of the opportunist pollution, because it was able to rid its ranks of the Liquidators, the Mensheviks. Proletarian parties develop and become strong by purging themselves of opportunists and reformists, social-imperialists and social-chauvinists, social-patriots and social-pacifists. The Party be comes strong by purging itself of opportunist elements." (Joseph Stalin, <I>Leninism.</I>)

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    5)&nbsp;The history of the Party further teaches us that a party cannot perform its role as leader of the working class if, carried away by success, it begins to grow conceited, ceases to observe the defects in its work, and fears to acknowledge its mistakes and frankly and honestly to correct them in good time. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A party is invincible if it does not fear criticism and self-criticism, if it does not gloss over the mistakes and defects in its work, if it teaches and educates its cadres by drawing the lessons from the mistakes in Party work, and if it knows how to correct its mistakes in time. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A party perishes if it conceals its mistakes, if it glosses over sore problems, if it covers up its shortcomings by pretending that all is well, if it is intolerant of criticism and self-criticism, if it gives way to self-complacency and vainglory and if it rests on its laurels. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The attitude of a political party towards its own mistakes," Lenin says, "is one of the most important and surest ways of judging how earnest the party is and how it <I>in practice</I> fulfils its obligations towards its <I>class</I> and the toiling <I>masses.</I> Frankly admitting a mistake, ascertaining the reasons for it, analysing the conditions which led to it, and thoroughly discussing the means of correcting it -- that is the earmark of a serious party; that is the way it should perform its duties, that is the way it should educate and train the <I>class</I>, and then the <I>masses.</I>" (Lenin, <I>Collected Works</I>, Russ. ed., Vol. XXV, p. 200.) 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    And further:

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "All revolutionary parties, which have hitherto perished, did so because they <I>grew conceited</I>, failed to see where their strength lay, <I>and feared to speak of their weaknesses.</I> But we shall not perish, for we do not fear to speak of our weaknesses and will learn to over-

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 362</B></FONT><P>

come them." (Lenin, <I>Collected Works</I>, Russ. ed., Vol. XXVII, pp. 260-61.)
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   6)&nbsp;Lastly, the history of the Party teaches us that unless it has wide connections with the masses, unless it constantly strengthens these connections, unless it knows how to hearken to the voice of the masses and understand their urgent needs, unless it is prepared not only to teach the masses, but to learn from the masses, a party of the working class cannot be a real mass party capable of leading the working class millions and all the labouring people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A party is invincible if it is able, as Lenin says, "to link itself with, to keep in close touch with, and, to a certain extent if you like, to merge with the broadest masses of the toilers -- primarily with the proletariat, but also with the non-proletarian toiling masses." (Lenin, <I>Collected Works</I>, Russ. ed., Vol. XXV, p. I74.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A party perishes if it shuts itself up in its narrow party shell, if it severs itself from the masses, if it allows itself to be covered with bureaucratic rust. 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "We may take it as the rule," Comrade Stalin says, "that as long as the Bolsheviks maintain connection with the broad masses of the people they will be invincible. And, on the contrary, as soon as the Bolsheviks sever themselves from the masses and lose their connection with them, as soon as they become covered with bureaucratic rust, they will lose all their strength and become a mere cipher. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     "In the mythology of the ancient Greeks there was a celebrated hero, Antaeus, who, so the legend goes, was the son of Poseidon, god of the seas, and Gaea, goddess of the earth. Antaeus was very much attached to the mother who had given birth to him, suckled him and reared him. There was not a hero whom this Antaeus did not vanquish. He was regarded as an invincible hero. Wherein lay his strength? It lay in the fact that every time he was hard pressed in a fight with an adversary he would touch the earth, the mother who had given birth to him and suckled him, and that gave him new strength. Yet he had a vulnerable spot -- the danger of being detached from the earth in some way or other. His enemies were aware of this weakness and watched for him. One day an enemy appeared who took advantage of this vulnerable spot and vanquished Antaeus. This was Hercules. How did Hercules vanquish Antaeus? He lifted him from the earth, kept him suspended in the air, prevented him from touching the earth, and throttled him. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     "I think that the Bolsheviks remind us of the hero of Greek

mythology, Antaeus. They, like Antaeus, are strong because they maintain connection with their mother, the masses, who gave birth to them, suckled them and reared them. And as long as they mairtain connection with their mother, with the people, they have every chance of remaining invincible.
