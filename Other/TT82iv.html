<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    Immediately after it emerged from the heroic National Liberation War, the People's Republic of Albania made every effort to establish close links of friendship with the Soviet Union, the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of Bulgaria and all the other countries of people's democracy of Europe. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The great friendship with all the friendly countries and fraternal peoples which we nurtured and tried to develop, to see it in practice and to strengthen ceaselessly, was founded on the National Liberation War and the blood shed by our peoples in this war against the same enemy. Despite the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 392</B></FONT><P>

great sacrifices which we made (by fighting alone in our own country and liberating it with our own forces, and by fighting beyond our state borders to assist in the liberation of Yugoslavia), we, for our part, had a proper appreciation of the great and decisive contribution of the Red Army as well as of the Yugoslav National Liberation Army and others to this liberation. The others minimized our war and taking advantage of our proper presentation of the question on the Marxist-Leninist line, used this as if <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>they did everything<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>without them we could not do anything<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. To them Albania was an infant which had to be bottle-fed, which had to be kept under patriarchal tutelage and the voice of which had no reason to be heard in the concert of the policy which the other countries of people's democracy pursued. As I said, in the first years this spirit of underrating us was felt most in the stands of the Yugoslav leaders, who acted in this way, not only because they were unscrupulous megalomaniacs, but also because they pursued sinister aims towards us. From the others, they wanted only an official <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>recognition<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Albania on paper, with declarations from afar, but they never wanted this recognition to take concrete form in the all-round mutual links of our country with the other countries of people's democracy, including the Soviet Union. To a certain extent, this anti-Albanian policy of Belgrade yielded results and the fact is that, while the friendly countries of people's democracy recognized us officially in 1945 and 1946, in reality they recognized us from a distance and, even worse, through the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>presentation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which Yugoslavia made of us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Such a spirit and practice were developed and permitted at first, but not by us. Of course, this spirit had its ups and downs, had restraints and angry threats, until the Gordian knot was severed with the sword. But let us not anticipate. It must be said that Yugoslavia and Tito were interested in keeping us isolated. They had certainly manoeuvred and continued to manoeuvre behind the scenes in the direction of Bulgaria, too, and had success up until the moment when we received the invitation of the Bulgarian government and the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 393</B></FONT><P>

Communist Party, in the name of Dimitrov, for our delegation to go to Sofia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The invitation which Dimitrov sent us was welcomed with great enthusiasm when I put it forward for discussion and approval in the Political Bureau and in the government. In the grave atmosphere of that period it was like a clear day after a stormy night fraught with dangers. I was charged with preparing the accurate formulation of the problems which we would raise and with the other technical problems, the composition of the delegation and informing the ambassadors of the friendly countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     First, I summoned the Bulgarian ambassador whom I thanked again and informed officially of our acceptance. Only the precise date of our departure remained to be decided jointly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Then, I summoned the Soviet ambassador and informed him, too. He implied to me that he had been informed by Moscow. I had no doubt about this, indeed, I was of the opinion that such an action could not have been taken without seeking the advice of Stalin. This was a special assurance for us. But we thought that the Yugoslavs, too, would have been informed. However, I summoned the Yugoslav ambassador, too, and informed him. He listened to me, took notes and said that he would immediately inform the government in Belgrade. I saw that the news did not please him and, as far as I could gather, he had not known about it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Has the Soviet ambassador been informed about this?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he asked me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I replied that I had informed the Soviet ambassador. I told him also that we would talk again later when, together with the Bulgarians, we had decided the day of our departure. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shall travel through Belgrade and will seek your assistance,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said in conclusion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Of course!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, I parted from the Yugoslav ambassador in a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>good<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>comradely spirit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, although I guessed that the Yugoslavs could not be pleased that we were going to interrupt our analyses and; 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 394</B></FONT><P>

postpone for later the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Albanian question<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which they had on the agenda. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We began and ended the preparations and set out for Sofia via Belgrade. I headed the delegation and its main members were Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Hysni Kapo, and Kristo Themelko. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was exceptionally happy to be going to Dimitrov's Bulgaria. Hysni, too, felt this same great joy. From the look of them, Ko&ccedil;i and Kristo Themelko, too, seemed to have the same feeling (but later it was realized that this was not so). This was the third time that I left the Homeland and went with official delegations to friendly and fraternal countries: the first time we went to Tito in Belgrade; the second time to Stalin in Moscow; and now we were going to Dimitrov in Sofia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The love and sympathy of our people, Party and government for Bulgaria and for its outstanding leader, Dimitrov, were marked. These feelings had their foundations in the long history of friendly traditions and these friendly traditions had been strengthened during the National Liberation War, irrespective of the fact that there had been few links and contacts between us and the Bulgarian partisans. In particular, the mighty figure of Georgi Dimitrov linked us closely in an unquestioned political-ideological unity. The Marxist-Leninist ideology which inspired our parties was the steel bond which united us in all our activities. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the past, when the Albanian people fought against the ambitions and terror of the Serbs, we were friends with the Bulgarian people and we liked, respected and assisted each other. The patriots and fighters of our National Renaissance found shelter and aid for their struggle in the bosom of the Bulgarian people; Albanian patriotic societies had been created in Sofia and there Albanian books and papers, which were smuggled into Albania, were printed. Our &ccedil;etas of the time of the Renaissance and during the Balkan Wars had close fighting relations with the insurgent &ccedil;etas of those parts, carried out joint actions and sheltered one another. Thus, there was a long history of very friendly links between our peoples. Our joint Anti-fascist National Liberation War strengthened 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 395</B></FONT><P>

these bonds even more; although, as I said, during the war we did not have direct contacts with the Bulgarian partisans. Only on one occasion, in 1943, Bulgaranov came to Labinot to meet me. We exchanged opinions about the war, but my impression was that the Bulgarians were weak. In fact, the Bulgarian partisan war developed slowly and flared up on a broad scale only when the Red Army entered Bulgaria. In the meeting which we had, Bulgaranov spoke well of the Yugoslavs and likewise, of our Albanian units which operated in thee districts of Dibra and Macedonia. He told us that he was delegated by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party to work with the Macedonians, whom he called Bulgarians at that time. I knew that Bulgaranov did not get along well with Tukmanovic-Tempo, who led the National Liberation War in Macedonia, but he told me that allegedly he got on well with the Yugoslavs. I pointed out to Bulgaranov that whole territories populated by Albanians had been included in Macedonia, that this was an injustice of the past and that after the anti-fascist National Liberation War the question of nationalities had to be examined according to the Leninist principles. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Only from this standpoint,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>will the problems of these zones and nations and nationalities that live in them be solved correctly. Otherwise, the old national oppression, contradictions and conflicts will continue. During the whole period of the war against the same enemy, fascism,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told Bulgaranov, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, the Communist Party of Albania and the Bulgarian Communist Party must work towards developing friendship amongst our peoples. We must enlighten our peoples politically in order to wipe out the bitter remnants of the past and lead them to victory; the peoples who have suffered from the injustices perpetrated by the Great Powers and the chauvinism of Balkan states must win the right to self-determination. This is what we think about the Albanians of those Albanian regions which were annexed to Yugoslavia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Seeing that I had opened the way, Bulgaranov, too, began 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 396</B></FONT><P>

to speak about the question of Macedonia, which he called part of Bulgaria. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I allowed him to express his opinion and did not enlarge on this question. I knew that the Yugoslavs, for their part had a tendency to minimize and disparage the war of the Bulgarians. Undoubtedly, one of the main reasons for this was the question of Macedonia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Apart from this meeting, we had no other contacts with the Bulgarian comrades during the years of the war, but we ceaselessly cultivated the feelings of fraternal internationalist friendship for the Bulgarian people and the Bulgarian Communist Party (which, as I recall, was called the Bulgarian Workers' Party at that time). The personality of Dimitrov, who had won world fame, played a major role in this. The name of the hero of Leipzig, of the General Secretary of the Comintern, was on the lips of all the communists and anti-nazis of the world. After the great classics of Marxism-Leninism, Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, we loved, admired and listened to him. Dimitrov was one of Stalin's closest friends and collaborators, therefore our going to Sofia and meeting Dimitrov was a great joy for us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      With these pure, friendly feelings for the friendly allied countries, our delegation set out and arrived in Belgrade on December 12. The welcome which we received at the railway station was extremely cool, but <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>officially<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the Yugoslavs showed themselves more than <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>correct in protocol<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: Kardelj, Rankovic, Simic (at that time Foreign Minister), Hebrang (Chairman of the Planning Commission), Tempo and a number of other personalities of lower rank had come out to meet us. As I said, our visit to Bulgaria was taking place at the time when Tito and company had gone on the attack against us, therefore, the turning out at the station of all these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>top-level authorities<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe called them, was something of a surprise to us. However, everything had its own explanation and the Yugoslavs had carefully calculated the actions they took. In public, the great rifts which had been created in the relations between our parties and countries had still not be-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 397</B></FONT><P>

come apparent and the Yugoslavs were striving to develop their attack in complete secrecy. Indeed, to eliminate any suspicion about this attack, they even made some gesture of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>fraternity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> towards us such as the turning out of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>top-level personalities<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> at the station. But all these things were done reluctantly and coldly. We knew nothing of diplomatic rules, protocol and formalities, such as ceremonies, etc., and did not even notice these things, but the fact is that, except for a few extremely official words of greeting demanded by protocol, Tito's comrades said not another word to us. However, there was no reason for this coldness to make an impression on us. Likewise, it made no impression on us that they took us to stay in what was virtually a private house (nationalized, of course). They told us it had been the home of Stoyadinovic, the Great-Serb fascist reactionary, who, in the time of the Yugoslav monarchy, talked with Ciano about dividing Albania with Mussolini's Italy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Regardless of the cold reception, the accusations which Zlatic had made and the grave situation that had been created in our country as a result of these accusations, I considered it necessary to utilize the time of our stay in Belgrade for a meeting with Tito, with the aim of talking directly with him about how the truth stood. For this reason, we decided to ask for a meeting with him, even if he did not invite us himself. As allies, we also considered it proper to inform him about the aims of our visit to Bulgaria, to tell him about the importance of the treaty which we expected to sign with fraternal Bulgaria and which we considered as a reinforcement of the treaty which we had with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Naturally, on this occasion we could also exchange opinions with him about the international situation, but the main thing, if this were possible, was that we wanted to speak openly about our internal matters and the tense relations with them. This was our disposition when we arrived in Belgrade. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      At the moment when we were parting from Kardelj and Rankovic, after they took us to the gate of the house where we 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 398</B></FONT><P>

were to stay, I put to them our request for a possible meeting with Tito. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Kardelj, cold as a snake. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito himself wants to meet and welcome you, perhaps this evening. We shall inform you at the proper time.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Not long afterwards they informed us that Tito was awaiting us for a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>meeting of welcome<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It is true that we were somewhat <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>excited<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about meeting these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>great men<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because that is how they presented themselves and that is how they wanted us to consider them. Whether a warm, comradely situation or a tense and frozen atmosphere was created depended on their character and stands. Two days later we were to meet Dimitrov for the first time, were to become acquainted with him and, I must say, that Tito could not compare with the outstanding leader of Bulgaria. They were as different as night from day, and I do not make this judgement from the standpoint of today, but these were my authentic impressions at that time. Tito remained haughty and cold with us, with measured, studied gestures and never allowed himself the mistake of making a gesture or saying any word which showed comradely closeness and warmth. No, nothing of the sort could be seen about him, everything was pre-considered and cold. In 1946, during the first meeting with him, we said that this might be his character, but now we were realizing that the meaning of Tito's coldness had another explanation. He wanted us, even in appearance, to stand at attention before him, as before the patriarch. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On this occasion Tito did not receive us in the Palace of Dedinja, but in a simple house within the city of Belgrade, I think in a street which is called Rumunska. It was a pleasant two-storeyed house of the old style, encircled by a high wall. We entered the hall, where, if I am not mistaken, Tito, Kardelj, Rankovic and Djilas welcomed us. Tito was dressed in grey woollen clothing and with shoes of the same colour. He stood as stiff as a ramrod. He simply gave us his hand, while asking after our health, and, when this ceremony 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 399</B></FONT><P>

was over, led us into his office which was off to one side. It was a longish room with a window nearly as wide as the room. Near the window was his working desk and in the middle of the room another long table. Apparently, the meetings of the Bureau were held there or Tito used it to summon other people about the work. We were to take our places at the table and, as usual, they would sit on one side and we on the other. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Please sit down,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Tito and remained standing himself. I took my seat and my comrades were preparing to take theirs, one after the other, beside me. But Tito intervened and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Xoxe, you sit here,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and indicated the big chair which stood empty at the head of the table. We were all dumbfounded by this action of Tito's. However, I calmly told Ko&ccedil;i, who was as red as a beetroot: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Go there where he tells you.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, Comrade Marshal, I can sit here, let Comrade Enver sit there,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i replied to Tito. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, no,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Tito, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>come here, you, too, can sit here.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I quietly told Ko&ccedil;i again to go where he was told. Thus this provocation was closed. We all took our seats. Tito took out his cigarette holder in the form of a pipe, put in a cigarette and lit it and then pushed the packet towards me saying: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Here, have a cigarette.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I told him I had given up smoking (this was not true, but I did not want to smoke his cigarettes after what he had done). Then Tito said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The comrades informed me that you are going to Bulgaria and, of course, you will meet Dimitrov. Are you pleased with the prospect of this visit?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I told him briefly about the purpose of our visit to Bulgaria, said that this had been a long-cherished desire, stressed the sympathy and love which the Albanian people had always displayed for Bulgaria, its people, and especially, for the outstanding leader of Bulgaria and the international communist and workers' movement, Georgi Dimitrov. I went on to 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 400</B></FONT><P>

say that we expected to hold talks with the Bulgarian comrades about strengthening mutual relations between our parties and countries and in this context we thought we would sign such documents which would reinforce not only the independence of our two countries, but also the relations between the People's Republic of Albania and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Tito listened to me with a frown on his face, his head held high, looking at me with those cold glassy eyes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When I had finished, Tito turned to Ko&ccedil;i and said with a smile: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Of course, you have prepared yourselves to benefit from the experience of the Bulgarian Communist Party. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We may be given the occasion to do such a thing, too, but we have unlimited possibilities to receive the experience of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia at any moment and about everything,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Ko&ccedil;i. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From beginning to end Rankovic sat without moving a muscle of his face, merely smoking cigarettes with his long white holder. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Then Tito began to speak. Not undeliberately, he virtually ignored everything I had said, where we were going, and what we were going to do. It was clear that with this stand he wanted to show us that it was of no importance at all to him what we were going to do with the Bulgarians. In other words, this meant that they did not like the visit we were about to make, because he concentrated his whole talk on <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the strengthening of Albanian-Yugoslav relations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>these relations have great importance for Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you Albanians must struggle against shortcomings and mistakes which are noticed in the work of your Party and state apparatuses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, in order not to hinder <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the great aid given to you by Yugoslavia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which made <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sacrifices<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for us etc. etc.! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     My impression was that Tito granted us this meeting before our departure for Bulgaria to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>remind<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us that, whether to Sofia or to Moscow or anywhere else, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our road passed 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 401</B></FONT><P>

through Belgrade<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. By talking in this way he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>set the limits<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for us with the Bulgarians. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I thanked Tito for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>his valuable advice<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, assured him sincerely about the love which we continued to nurture for the friendly and fraternal Yugoslav peoples and, just as I was preparing to start on our problems in which, according to him, we had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mistakes and shortcomings<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, he stood up. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shall have the opportunity when you return from Bulgaria,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, and walked out of the room, inviting us to watch a film together. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After the film, from which I can remember nothing at all, they gave us a coffee, or as they say in Gjirokastra, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the time-to-go coffee<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. We shook hands and parted. We thought that we would have no other contact with the Yugoslav leaders. But they had proposed to Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe individually and without my knowledge that he should meet with Rankovic or Ko&ccedil;i had sought such a meeting himself. Most likely, however, Rankovic asked to meet Ko&ccedil;i. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This occurred that evening before we left by train for Bulgaria. We were resting before dinner when Ko&ccedil;i and Shule came into the room where I was sitting with Hysni and said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Enver, Shule and I are going to go to meet Marko (Rankovic) and discuss with him how the work of the Party should be organized at brigade and division staff level.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Wouldn't it be better when we come back?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Make the request now and you'll have more time on our return.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Ko&ccedil;i, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>it's better to get it over and done with this evening and then our minds are at rest.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>All right,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>off you go.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i and Shule went to see Rankovic while Hysni and I stayed in the house, indeed we did not wait dinner for them because the Yugoslav comrade accompanying us <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advised<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us to have dinner, since the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>comrades might be late<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When they returned from the meeting, both Ko&ccedil;i and Kristo looked satisfied and happy, because they had received 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 402</B></FONT><P>

<FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>detailed and complete explanations about the method of work of the party at brigade and division level<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. The outcome of this night-time meeting between Rankovic, Ko&ccedil;i and Shule was to emerge in Sofia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The reasons which Ko&ccedil;i and ShuIe gave for their visit to Rankovic in these circumstances did not convince me in the least, and no doubt, did not convince Hysni, either, but we said nothing to each other; we pretended that we found the visit natural. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The next day we left for Bulgaria. Anton Jugov and many other comrades of the Bulgarian leadership welcomed us very warmly at the border. We embraced and kissed like the closest comrades and brothers. They brought us best wishes from Dimitrov and told us that he personally and all the other comrades of the party leadership and the government would welcome us at the main station in Sofia. Our first contact with the representatives of the Bulgarian people was warm and moving. Ordinary people embraced us, welcomed us and wished us success on our visit and in strengthening the mutual relations between our two countries and peoples. I greeted them with a brief statement in which I expressed the great feelings of love which the Albanian people nurtured for the fraternal Bulgarian people and our belief that our friendly relations would steadily advance, and ended by calling: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Long live your great leader Georgi Dimitrov!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The people burst into a long ovation. In accord with the national tradition they gave us bread and salt, while a young girl presented me with a beautifully embroidered traditional Bulgarian costume. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Each stitch in this costume is an expression of love for the Albanian people from the Bulgarian people,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> she said, her eyes filled with tears of enthusiasm, and embraced me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this atmosphere we set out for Sofia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We arrived. A great crowd had turned out to meet us, headed by the leadership and the great Dimitrov, with his manly face graven like a true revolutionary, with his long 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 403</B></FONT><P>

hair blowing free, because he had removed his fur cap, despite the cold and the falling snow. He welcomed me on the platform, gave me his hand, pressed me to his chest and kissed me. It was a very moving moment for me. I flung my arms round his neck and did not release him. My eyes were filled with tears of emotion, because the day had come that the Party and the people sent me here to meet this great teacher of the proletariat, from whose example, teachings and advice I had learned, as his loyal pupil, how to stand and fight against the fascist invaders, against enemies of the people and the working class for the liberation of my Homeland, for the formation and tempering of my Party, for socialism and communism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When the ceremonies at the station were over, we got into cars to go to the premises of the Bulgarian government. Dimitrov and I were in the first open car and we passed through long lines of people crowding the streets, the foot paths, the squares, the windows and balconies. Albanian and Bulgarian flags, portraits and slogans about Albanian-Bulgarian friendship could be seen everywhere. What boundless love of the people for Dimitrov, for Stalin and for Albania! The square in front of the palace was packed with people. From the balcony of the palace we were to greet the fraternal Bulgarian people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Before we went out on the balcony we stayed very close to Dimitrov. He was great in his exemplary modesty. He asked me about our people, our Party, our comrades. He spoke Russian while I spoke Albanian, because I knew very little Russian. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     When we came out on the balcony, amidst ovations from the people, the voice of Dimitrov boomed out. He had a powerful, resonant voice though his breathing was laboured because it was hindered by asthma; he spoke with enthusiasm, with fire, with boundless love for our people. While listening to him I had my gaze fixed on him and in my mind I recalled his titanic struggles, the torture and suffering he had undergone for the cause of the world proletariat, thought about this proletarian who could never be broken, but who 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 404</B></FONT><P>

rose continually like Antaeus, amidst the storms, for the triumph of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     My speech, too, was warmly received by the people of Sofia, because it was simple and expressed the ardent love and deepest feelings of our people and Party for the Bulgarian people, the Communist Party of Bulgaria and Dimitrov personally. I gave a brief outline of the history of our people in the past and during the National Liberation War, of our close Leninist links with the Soviet Union, with the heroic Red Army, with Stalin, and with Dimitrov's Bulgaria. I also mentioned our relations with the new Yugoslavia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the official joint talks of the two delegations, I spoke on behalf of our delegation and Dimitrov on behalf of the Bulgarian delegation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I made a relatively lengthy exposition in which I described the development of the National Liberation War and the principles which guided our war. I related how the first foundations were laid and the people's state power was created during and after the war; I spoke about the formation of &ccedil;etas and the National Liberation Army in the heat of battles and actions; about the mobilization of the people and the creation of the National Liberation Front. I described what policy we pursued in connection with the Front and the main forms of the work, pointing out the historical fact that the Front was led by the Communist Party, that neither in the Front nor outside it did we have other parties within the country. Then I spoke about the Party, without which nothing could have been achieved, spoke about the directives which we received from the Comintern, etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I went on to give an outline of the general political and economic situation and very briefly touched on our relations with Yugoslavia. Of course, this was neither the place nor the occasion to go into detail about our relations, whether good or bad, with Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav leadership. What was going on in Tirana in connection with these relations I tried to keep deep within myself, to avoid implying to the Bulgarian comrades or anybody else that something bad was 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 405</B></FONT><P>

occurring between us and Tito. Later, when the moment came, when the situation had ripened and become clear, then everything would be stated openly. The Bulgarian comrades themselves did not give us the occasion and did not ask us to go into detail about our relations with Yugoslavia. They had displayed Tito's portrait along with the portraits of Stalin, Dimitrov and me, and they, too, spoke only in general about their friendship with the fraternal peoples of Yugoslavia, their joint road for the construction of the new life, and that was all. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In my exposition, then, I got over the question of Yugoslavia without any embarrassment and pointed out to the friends that our internal political situation was strong, but that we were struggling against numerous, all-round difficulties for the development of our economy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I spoke about the subversive activity of the Anglo-Americans. We were waging a continual war against agents dropped from the air, landed from the sea, or infiltrated over the border from Greece, and the latter country was carrying on ceaseless unrestrained propaganda making claims to Southern Albania and remained <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in a state of war<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the People's Republic of Albania. I stressed that all this propaganda and subversive activity did not frighten our people at all, but on the contrary, they were being strengthened and tempered, increasing and sharpening their vigilance day by day. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Comrade Dimitrov congratulated me on my exposition and, to tell the truth, I retain to this day the impression that I had passed a great test, because I was worked up about being in the presence of Dimitrov, although, amongst all the great leaders that I have ever met, he was the most unpretentious. The respect and love which I had for him were precisely the factors which increased my emotion. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After I had spoken, Dimitrov rose and made a fiery speech about our friendship and especially about our people and their heroic wars. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We listened with the greatest attention to his words, to his profound thoughts when he spoke about the important 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 406</B></FONT><P>

role of the Soviet Union and the great Stalin in the question of the crowning with success of the Second World War and the establishment of the new order in our countries. He opened to us a broad horizon about the problems of the foreign policy of our socialist countries, together with the Soviet Union, and the savage policy of Anglo-American imperialism and its satellites, against which we had to wage a stern fight in all fields. Dimitrov touched on the question of Greece where monarcho-fascist reaction ruled, as well as on the disturbed and unstable situation in neo-fascist Italy and stressed: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They will be powerless to harm Albania because the new People's Albania knows very well how to defend itself and we shall defend ourselves together.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Going on to mention the Treaty of Friendship, Collaboration and Mutual Aid between Albania and Yugoslavia, Dimitrov, in the name of the Bulgarian government and people, proposed that a treaty of friendship and mutual aid should be signed between Albania and Bulgaria, also, which we had foreseen, too. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Our enthusiasm reached its climax. I stood up and in a brief and moving speech, because I could hardly speak from joy and emotion, I said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are completely in agreement with your proposal. Our people and government will be extremely happy and grateful. This is a day of historic importance for our people,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      We embraced and kissed. There had never been a happier day for us. It seemed to us that we had gained the heavens. We would make even more secure the borders of our Homeland for the freedom of which our people had shed so much blood through the centuries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I am not going to speak about the ceremonies and visits which our delegation made in Sofia to the different institutions and factories, because there were many of them, and after all these years I cannot remember them all one by one, but the enthusiasm and love which the Bulgarian working people and working class displayed for the Albanian people have remained unforgettable for me. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 407</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In one great festive evening in Sofia they awarded me the title <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Honorary Citizen of Sofia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and I remember that that evening we sang and danced with ordinary citizens and the Bulgarian leaders, just as if we were in Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      At one moment (I don't remember whether it was during this evening or at the dinner he put on to welcome us) Dimitrov said amongst other things: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Our people honour and respect your people and your wonderful traditions and qualities. Since the time of my childhood I've heard the saying amongst our people, 'May you be as dauntless as the Arnauts, i.e., the Albanians.' Your quality of never bowing your heads in the face of any difficulty or danger is very well known amongst us.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I looked at him carefully right in the eye in order to understand whether he had said this quite casually or had something else in mind, but I was unable to discover anything. He smiled at me and raised his glass. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
       <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>this has been a feature of our people over the centuries. They have been attacked by many enemies, have done battle with them, have shed their blood, have made great sacrifices, but have never bent the knee. Now that we have the Party this feature is being further strengthened. We shall never give way in the face of any difficulty or obstacle, Comrade Dimitrov.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Good luck!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said and we clinked glasses. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Long live your people!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As I said, there were many visits and they were very cordial. At one cooperative that we visited they took us to a field of strawberries. I remember that we were accompanied there by Traicho Kostov, a deputy prime minister and minister of internal affairs of Bulgaria (the Bulgarian counterpart of Rankovic who was condemned after the exposure of the Titoite betrayal and rehabilitated when the Khrushchevites came to power), as well as by Georgi Traikov, general secretary of the Bulgarian Popular Agrarian Union, who at that time was deputy prime minister and later was elected president of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the Peo- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 408</B></FONT><P>

ple's Republic of Bulgaria. Men and women welcomed us there. After we talked, an old man asked me about Georgi Traikov: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <I>Who's that?</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I told him who he was, but the old man got up and said to him:  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Where are you, <I>brate </I>?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp408">*</A>]</FONT> You are the chairman of our Agrarian Party and in all my long life I've never seen you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This made an impression on us, because it was evidence of the weak links which these people had with the masses. Regardless of the fact that Traikov was of Stambolisky's'<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp408">1</A>]</FONT> Agrarian Party, the Bulgarian Communist Party kept him very close to the leadership and, indeed, they told us that he was a communist, but they did not declare this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The official dinner which Dimitrov put on for us will remain unforgettable. He was wearing a black suit. He seated Nexhmije on his right side while I, facing him, had his wife on my right. I remember a small but very significant detail. Before we began the speeches and the eating, Dimitrov gathered up the large range of spoons and forks he had in front of him and said to the waiter: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Take these away, I've no need for twenty. One knife, fork and spoon is enough for me.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> He was such a simple man that he could not tolerate bourgeois luxury and customs. Inspired by his simplicity, I, too, filled the waiter's hands with nickel-plated cutlery. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After Dimitrov had spoken I replied with very warm words, some of which I devoted to the great figure of Dimitrov, to his major role as a leader, not only of the Bulgarian communists, but of all the communists of the world, and described him as a pupil and very close collaborator of the great Stalin, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The dinner passed in a very happy atmosphere. Dimitrov was a man who laughed readily and was very optimistic. When the dinner was over we returned in great spirits and with

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 409</B></FONT><P>

indelible impressions to the residence in which we were staying, a palace of ex-King Boris. After we sat down in the sitting-room to smoke a cigarette and to talk over the impressions we had from the dinner, we went to our bed-rooms. But I could not sleep. In my mind's eyes I was going over the impressions of the meetings and the warm words of Dimitrov, calling back to my mind his life of the undaunted fighter, the efforts and sacrifices he had made for the cause of his people and the world proletariat. It must have been well past midnight when I heard a knock at the door. I got up and opened it. At the door-step were Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Shule with frowning faces. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What has happened? Have you still not gone to sleep?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We've not gone to sleep because we want to talk with you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Is it that urgent?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Couldn't you wait till next morning?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Shule and I are so worried that we could not sleep,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>So we want to talk now!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I stared at them fixedly for a moment, told them to wait for me in the sitting-room till I threw something on my back and uent inaide [went inside? -- <FONT SIZE=-2>DJR</FONT>]. Hysni had heard the knocking at the door of my bed-room and the voices after midnight and appeared at the door of his bed-room. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Come, Hysni,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Ko&ccedil;i and Shule have something urgent to tell us!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We sat down in the sitting-room and Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe began saying: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I and Shule did not like your speech at the dinner and do not agree with what you said about Dimitrov!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I opened my eyes in astonishment and shot a glance at Hysni, who was just as astonished as I was. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i continued: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are not in agreement with all those epithets you used about him. We don't say that Dimitrov is not an outstanding man, but you gave him a major role.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 410</B></FONT><P>

    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I made no mistake in what I said. I did not exaggerate anything about Dimitrov,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I should have said more, because he deserves it. It's you who are wrong, although I don't understand how such a thing causes you so much torture that you can't sleep for it! Not only ought we to speak of Dimitrov,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but the whole revolutionary and progressive world has spoken about him in ardent terms which he fully deserves!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Hysni intervened angrily, talking my side: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What are you saying? What are these out-of-place things?! Everything in Comrade Enver's speech was correct!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Ko&ccedil;i jumped up and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That's what you think, but we think otherwise, we disagree with you.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We'll settle this matter in Tirana,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told them in a stern tone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This disagreement must not hinder us from carrying out our work with success and accomplishing the task with which the Party and the government have charged us.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, yes,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Ko&ccedil;i, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but in all that speech in which you praised Dimitrov so much you ignored Tito completely and did not say one word about him. I do not agree that Dimitrov should outshine the grandeur of Tito, his capacity and reputation as an outstanding revolutionary. Tito is the greatest figure and the most brilliant image of the peoples of the Balkans. You said, 'Dimitrov is an outstanding international figure', but this must be said about Tito, because he really is such a figure, and Tito's Yugoslavia today should become the very centre of the peoples of the Balkans.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Then, I realized why they could not sleep and what all this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>concern<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was about and why they disagreed with us. I immediately remembered their meeting with Rankovic in Belgrade and understood the whole significance and reason for that meeting, allegedly to receive party instructions, but, in fact, to receive directives to keep us under surveillance lest we go beyond the limits dictated by the Yugoslavs, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to correct<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us and to act in support of the secret directives of Tito-Rankovic. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I told Ko&ccedil;i and Shule: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is a provocation you are committing, because I think that a toast at an official dinner in Bulgaria was not the place to speak of the merits of Tito. I mentioned Tito when I spoke of our friendship with Yugoslavia, and it seems to me that this was correct and sufficient, therefore, I do not budge from my opinion.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We do not agree with you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> persisted Kristo and Ko&ccedil;i red-faced. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Neither do I agree with you. We shall discuss this question in Tirana. Now let us go to bed because we have work to do tomorrow,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said curtly and stood up. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I'm in full agreement with the opinion of Comrade Enver,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interjected Hysni and we went to our bed-rooms to lie awake all night. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This was the first incident that occurred in Bulgaria with Ko&ccedil;i and Kristo. There was to be another, this time in the form of an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>amendment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to a document which we were to sign in connection with the development of trade between the two countries. It was a simple normal document drafted in principle, as is done in such cases. The two <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>adherents to principles<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (put up to this by Rankovic) told me that we should add to the text the words <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in agreement with Yugoslavia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I told them that it was not good for us to ask for such a thing to be put in. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In practice no one ties our hands to prevent us acting as we see best,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I went on. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If we see it beneficial we sell and buy in Bulgaria, too, of course, first of all fulfilling the obligations we have under the agreements signed with Yugoslavia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      However, since it was impossible to convince them (they were convinced about dependence on the Yugoslavs), in the end I said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Propose some sort of amendment and discuss it in the preparatory commission.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 412</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Eventually, at the plenary meeting, on the intervention of Dimitrov, Kolarov<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp412">1</A>]</FONT>, one of the Bulgarian leaders and a comrade of Dimitrov's, formulated something of this nature and the incident was closed. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe had something to report to his colleague Rankovic when we returned! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      In our free time the Bulgarian comrades came and talked with us about various problems. Kolarov, too, was very unpretentious and friendly with us. One day he talked to us about Stalin, about the heroism of the bolsheviks, about the difficult situation in the Soviet Union after the revolution, about the 1st Five-year Plan and the enthusiasm of the masses. He also told us about his work in the Comintern and the time when he was sent to work in Mongolia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How difficult it was there!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> related Kolarov. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The country and the people were just as in the depths of the Middle Ages, the lamas and the monasteries ruled. Each family was compelled to send one or two sons to become lamas. The lama institutions were all centres of Japanese espionage. The nomadic people were completely illiterate, ignorant, syphilitic, and suffered indescribable poverty. Doctors, medicines, bread were unknown to them. All they had was meat <I>kumis</I> (mare's milk), sheep-skin clothing, horses, and nothing else. Belief in religion and mysticism were complete. When people died in Ulan Bator they did not bury them, but there was a pit and they threw them in there. Sometimes they threw them in still alive. On account of the climate the bodies did not putrify but 'dissolved.' The people lived in tents. With the aid of the Soviets the people's regime of Suhe Bator began to build some apartments,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Kolarov, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but no one would move into them. Great propaganda was necessary about everything, down to the smallest things, and in particular, a great struggle had to be waged against the influence of the lamas and their despotic structure supported by the Japanese.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The moment came when we were to go to Kritchim, where we were to sign the agreements. On the way we visited historical sites, factories and cooperatives. Everywhere we were welcomed with indescribable joy and enthusiasm. Along the railway great masses of people standing in the snow cheered <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Hurrah!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. The train stopped, we were given gifts, started again, and thus we arrived at the place, the name of which I can't remember, where we were to leave the train and go to Kritchim by car. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      When the train stopped the cheering crowd broke through the cordons and blocked the road. Dimitrov and I were the first to struggle through. Dimitrov said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They'll be here a long time. If we wait for the comrades we'll be caught up in the people again, therefore let you and me get in the car and 'break through'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (in a word, he meant like the comitadjis of old). And that is what we did. Dimitrov, I and the guard drove ahead through the snow. The convoy was a long way behind. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We have no security guards, <I>brate</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the driver said to Dimitrov. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Drive on! We have the people to protect us,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Dimitrov. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Near Kritchim the people had blocked the road. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You must speak to them!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Dimitrov said to me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In Russian?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How can I speak to them?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I know a little Russian, but I can't speak with those few words I know.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT><I>Davaj</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>* said Dimitrov, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you speak Albanian, because even without knowing Albanian, I'll translate faithfully for you, since I know what you want to say to them, for our feelings are the same, we have the one heart.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      And that is what we did. We stood up in front of the people, I spoke in Albanian with a few Russian words, and the dear old man translated into Bulgarian.

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 414</B></FONT><P>

     When we got back into the car Dimitrov said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The peasants won't be surprised how I know Albanian, because the Bulgarians and the Albanians have always been brothers and comrades-in-arms.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Dear, beloved Georgi Dimitrov, honey flowed from your mouth, as our people say! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Finally we reached Kritchim. Kritchim is a big village where the kings of Bulgaria had the best lands and had built a beautiful hunting palace, both for summer and winter. In this palace, which was now the property of the Republic, we were the guests of the Bulgarian party and government and Dimitrov personally. In this beautiful place there was a marvellous park, with flowers growing in open beds and in hot-houses, which flourished and bloomed winter and summer. There they cultivated many kinds of trees, including some tall strong coniferous trees called sequoia, brought from Canada, as they told us. In this park they kept and fed animals and birds which had been tamed and acclimatized. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Here something unexpected and unpleasant happened through Kristo Themelko. On the second day he had got up early in the morning, taken a shot-gun and gone out into the park. When we had all gathered downstairs Shule came in <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>triumphantly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> carrying a big dead bird. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I shot it in the park,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said proudly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What have you done!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Yugov. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>These are rare birds which we protect. We don't kill them, they are the ornaments of the park. But it doesn't matter!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he added to cover his annoyance. Kristo Themelko's feathers drooped worse than those of the bird he had shot. We felt very sorry and ashamed about what had happened. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      In Kritchim we ended the talks, concluded and signed the Treaty of Friendship, Collaboration and Mutual Aid. It was a solemn moment, especially for my comrades and me. The signing was done in the entrance hall. There a big table had been placed at which Dimitrov and I sat. We signed the documents, exchanged them, shook hands with each 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 415</B></FONT><P>

other and embraced strongly. We had signed an historic act<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp415">1</A>]</FONT> of great importance which ensured the People's Republic of Albania against the eventual threats of enemies. The Albanian people and their Party would welcome with great cheering and enthusiasm this treaty signed with the Bulgarian people, their old friends who had now emerged into the light of socialism under the leadership of Dimitrov and the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the decisive aid of the Soviet Union and Stalin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The snow had covered everything and on this joyful day everything looked marvellous. I forgot the villainous intrigues of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe who strutted around like a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>big gun<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in his lieutenant-general's uniform, without which he never failed to appear in order to give himself authority. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      After we had eaten and congratulated one another, photographs were taken to mark the occasion and Dimitrov proposed we take a ride through the park. Everybody agreed. Landaus, each drawn by two black horses, were awaiting us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You come with me,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Dimitrov and we got in together with an interpreter. It was a marvellous drive. For me it was a great honour to sit so close to Dimitrov, my beloved teacher of communism and the revolution. On the way he began to ask me about comrades he had known, about Ali Kelmendi, about the democratic priest Fan Noli, and Dr. Omer Nishani. Then he asked me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What happened to the Trotskyite Zai Fundo?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shot him,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He turned out to be an agent of the British and the feudals!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You did very well that you got rid of such rubbish,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Dimitrov.

This treaty which we signed with Dimitrov was a symbol of the friendship between the Albanian and Bulgarian peoples, whereas now that the revisionists, such as Zhivkov and company -- obedient lackeys of the Soviet social-imperialists, have come to power, this treaty is a dead letter. As to the friendship between our peoples, it will remain alive as it was in the time of our Renaissance men and in the time of the unforgettable Dimitrov. (<I>Author's note.</I>) 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 416</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Then I asked Dimitrov what he thought about our Party and its line during the war and now. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He replied: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is a courageous, revolutionary party of the new type, as Stalin teaches us. The line of your Party has been correct. As far as I can judge it has shown maturity in the mobilization of the Front and the rallying of the people in it. Since there were no bourgeois parties in your country, you did well that you did not permit or encourage the formation of them, because they would have caused you difficulties, as they are trying to cause us. Look here, Comrade Enver,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Dimitrov, putting his hand on my knee, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>keep the Party pure! Let it be revolutionary, proletarian and everything will go well with you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Dear Georgi Dimitrov! What he told me as we drove through the snow that morning in Kritchim is implanted in my mind and my heart forever. As long as I live I will be faithful to it and will fight to ensure that the Party is revolutionary and proletarian! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     These were unforgettable moments, unforgettable days for our people and especially for me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We parted from sister Bulgaria, from the great Dimitrov, from the Bulgarian people and comrades with tears in our eyes, thanking them from our hearts for their hospitality, for the great and sincere friendship which they displayed for our people, for the Party and the People's Republic of Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All the members of the delegation were very happy at the prospect of returning to the Homeland and informing the people and Party about the great political results which we had achieved. In regard to aid in the economic field, despite the great poverty in our country, we did not ask for any on account of the fact that the Bulgarians were in great difficulties, too, and the Soviet Union was assisting them. For their part, they did not make any concrete proposal either, but, of course, the way was open to reciprocal trade and to the according of some credit when the situation became more favourable for them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Even Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Kristo Themelko seemed happy. I 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 417</B></FONT><P>

had the impression that they had understood the stupidity of what they had done and I thought that that unpleasant scene was forgotten. I thought that the very close and friendly stand of Dimitrov and all the Bulgarian comrades towards us, our Party and our country had caused them to assess their stand towards the course followed by our Party, especially in its relations to the Yugoslav leadership, in a different light. They should have realized that for us, neither the world, nor socialism began and ended in Yugoslavia. They should have understood that our Party, our country had their own role and importance which we had to ceaselessly safeguard and strengthen. Hence, it was the opportunity for them to start to clear the rubbish out of their heads. I saw a certain joy in their eyes and gestures, and our train journey through Bulgaria and Yugoslavia towards Belgrade passed happily. We sang, asked the Bulgarian and Yugoslav guards about the places we were passing through and they explained to us where battles had taken place, etc. We asked one another: Will Tito receive us? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As I said, when we passed through Belgrade he told us that we would talk about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>our relations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> when we returned and I knew that if they began, these talks would be extremely difficult. Nevertheless, matters had to be carried through to the end. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      However, as soon as we arrived at the railway station in Belgrade it was obvious that talks were not going to take place. Apart from an even more frigid atmosphere than the last time, now only a few third- and fourth-rate officials had come to meet us. We got into cars and, after they took us to the same place where we stayed before, they prepared to depart in order to leave us <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in peace<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I asked the one who had been appointed to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accompany<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> me, or more correctly, to see me off, whether he knew when we were to meet Tito according to the promise made. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said the official <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>officially<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> left two days ago for a friendly visit to Rumania!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I nodded my head to let the official know that I under- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 418</B></FONT><P>

stood everything clearly and held out my hand to him. Neither he nor the others made any proposal for a program or suggested a meeting with any other comrade of the Yugoslav leadership. And I made no request either. The next day we set out for and arrived in Tirana.

    The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>analyses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which began in our leadership after the accusations which they made through Savo Zlatic and after the suicide of Nako Spiru convinced the Yugoslav leadership that its strategic plan for turning Albania into the 7th Re- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 420</B></FONT><P>

public of Yugoslavia was proceeding as had been envisaged. In order to disguise themselves before giving the final blow the Yugoslavs made a temporary <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>retreat<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. They no longer attacked us directly, began to murmur about their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>feelings of friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> towards sister Albania and loudly advertised the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which they gave us, on paper, of course. All over Yugoslavia, at meetings and rallies, on the radio, in the press, etc., they said that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in grave and difficult days we stand beside our Albanian brothers<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>for all our poverty we must save something and send it to Albania<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, and indeed, with collection boxes in hand, the Titoite jugglers even organized campaigns to collect charity for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the poor<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     All this was a truly insulting and demagogic farce worthy of those who want to cover up and disguise tragedies with buffonery. Especially at the moments when we were to set out for Bulgaria this farce was played with greater fervour, Tito sensed that the unexpected invitation which we received from Dimitrov to visit Bulgaria was not something fortuitous: undoubtedly he saw in it the intervention of the Soviets and, first of all, of Stalin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At the same time, this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>popular internationalist aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which was trumpeted inside and outside Yugoslavia was to serve the leaders of Belgrade as that layer of powder which is sprinkled over a massacred corpse. They hoped that the Albanian people would be blinded by the Yugoslav buffonery of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>solidarity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and not realize that they were being stabbed in the back. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We ourselves now saw that something unpleasant and evil was being hidden behind all this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>beautiful<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> facade. When Belgrade smiled, we had the feeling that something evil was being prepared for our Party and country. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The stick and the carrot<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the accusations and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>promises<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Tito and his henchmen were being felt and seen in their true light, as links of a chain, in Tirana. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, in all this farce of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> we saw the other side of the medal: the fever of fear and anxiety which haunted the chiefs in Belgrade, step by step, in the crime 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 421</B></FONT><P>

which they were preparing to commit. Every action, every tactic of theirs against us, bore within itself the seeds of their inevitable exposure and the defeat of the plot. And the more the chiefs of the CPY were to hasten to commit their evil deed against us the nearer they were to approach their ignominious and inevitable doom.

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    On the eve of 1948, as a New Year <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>gift<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the leadership in Belgrade concentrated its attention on us in two fields in particular: first, in the economy and second, in the field of defence, in the army. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In regard to the Party, they thought that they already had it completely in their hands. Since the Berat Plenum, their henchmen, especially Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo, had become complete Titoites, had been perfected in the methods of conspirators, so that even without the direct interference of the Yugoslavs it was thought that they could guide the situation created according to the taste of their masters. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Thus, the Yugoslavs thought that in their agents recruited in the leadership of our Party they had the key to success, their strongest point; whereas in fact precisely here lay one of their weakest points, which would lead them to exposure and defeat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This had to do with the anti-Marxist, Trotskyite concept of Tito and company about the party, its role and its functions. According to them, the base of the party was the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>mob<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, was the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>claque<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which need be given no attention because it had no role other than to obey, blindly and without any opposition, the orders and directives which came <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>from above<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the leadership<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and especially from the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>strong hand<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Proceeding from this concept, both in their own party 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 422</B></FONT><P>

and in ours, they had concentrated their attention mainly on <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the top ranks<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, on winning over a pro-Titoite lobby in the leadership, a lobby which, according to them, would lead the whole party like a flock of sheep into Tito's fold. However, when the time came, precisely this anti-Marxist concept was to lead its bearers to the brink of disaster. Four or five recruited agents, however powerful, would be nothing in face of the colossal strength of our Party which had been educated and tempered to lead the people on the course of safeguarding and strengthening their freedom, and not up the blind alleys where Tito and his gang wanted to drive them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, this was to be proved later. At first, Tito and company thought that through their agent, the organizational secretary Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, they had our Party <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in their grip<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and since, according to them, matters would go like clockwork in the Party, they concentrated their main attention on our economy and army. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     On the basis of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proposals<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav leadership, which Zlatic had presented together with the accusations, at the beginning of December Zlatic came with another Yugoslav, Sergej Krajger, with a bundle of files under his arm. Present from our side were Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Pandi Kristo and I. They <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>congratulated<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us on being rid, at last, of Nako Spiru, the element who <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>has complicated and harmed matters and has even managed to cause mutual frictions and doubts between us<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, and then they opened the files. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Now,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Zlatic, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we want to put forward the question of the Co-ordination Commission more concretely. Comrade Krajger, one of our best experts on economic problems, has been charged by our leadership to carry the burden of chairman of this commission. It will be a Yugoslav-Albanian commission, that is, Albanian representatives will take part in it, too. It will follow the course of the development of the economy of our countries in detail, so that everything will be harmonized, that is, well co-ordinated.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When we met at the beginning of November,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said to Zlatic, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I asked you what the character of this commission 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 423</B></FONT><P>

would be and in what relationship the respective governments of the two countries would be with it and its competences. We are still completely unclear about this.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are right,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conceded<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Zlatic, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>because greater problems have preoccupied you. I shall reply to the best of my ability. You mentioned an extremely delicate problem, 'the relationship between the commission and the respective governments of the two countries'. I want you to understand me correctly in what I am about to say. The very idea of an economic union between our countries cannot be concretized without a common organ which, you might say, will stand and function between our two governments. If the work of economic union for the Yugoslav side is left solely in the hands of the Yugoslav government and, for the Albanian side, solely in the hands of the Albanian government, then troubles, conflicts, frictions and everything else will arise for us. The Co-ordination Commission will be the organ which eliminates these dangers.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then is it to be an organ above our governments?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, it will not be above the governments. Its competences will extend in the first place only over economic matters, thus in the other fields all the competences remain in the hands of your government.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What is that? Does that mean we are to be 'relieved' of economic matters?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are misunderstanding me!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Zlatic, angrily. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I did not say you should be relieved of the economy. I said that the field of competences of the commission will extend only to economic matters and moreover, even here, the commission will be engaged with the problems which have to do with common plans, with the most effective ways for the co-ordination of plans, with the definition and detailing of the budgets, investments and income, with checkup on the accomplishment of tasks and measures which will be allocated, hence with all the major problems in this field. After that let the government decide about the economy.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 424</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>And what is left in all this for our government to decide, as you say, when the Co-ordination Commission knows and settles everything?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't know why you are afraid of this commission, Comrade Enver,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Zlatic. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are proceeding from a mistaken idea about it and consequently you look on everything with suspicion. The matter cannot be discussed on this basis. You should have faith in the advantages of the commission. Our comrades in Belgrade have considered it carefully, have studied all the advantages of it and that is why we demand that the commission should be formed. It will be an organ to assist both you and us, will have a great deal of work and many tasks and I regret that you are questioning everything. We came with the idea that the time was over when doubts and frictions began over every issue.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>My question was sincere and very concrete,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said calmly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't believe that either Comrade Tito or you want us to accept ideas or projects about which we are not clear.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I agree with you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Zlatic <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>backed down<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But I say with conviction that you would not question us so much, if you had more faith in the sincerity and fairness of our proposals. Everything we say is for your benefit. Without an intermediary co-ordinating organ our governments will be faced with major difficulties. Our governments should not quarrel with each other through the fault of a few directors or specialists of the economy. Let comrades competent in this field solve the economic problems, let them have the friction with one another and find the proper solutions. Comrade Krajger is ready to cope with all the difficulties which will arise. Let the governments decide the major questions. That is clear. I don't know what Comrades Xoxe or Kristo have to say?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We thank you from our hearts for all this aid and these ideas which the Yugoslav leadership gives us,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe there and then. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I'm not a specialist in these matters, because the economy is not my sector, but I know in 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 425</B></FONT><P>

my own mind that the Co-ordination Commission will advance the work and the things that occurred in the past will not occur again. I don't think that the Comrade Commander has no faith in you, either, but the economy is very complicated. Moreover, Nako Spiru confused us and we do not understand what is being done.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Quite right!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Zlatic congratulated Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>These problems of the economy are very difficult and complicated, especially those of economic union. In Belgrade the cream of our economic specialists are engaged in this work. I don't want Comrade Enver to misunderstand me, but I myself do not thoroughly understand all the secrets of these matters. If I knew them I would tell you. The main thing is the good spirit. Comrade Xoxe put it correctly. He is not a specialist, but his class instinct leads him to correct conclusions. Those who come from the intelligentsia ought to learn from him!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe nodded his head very pleased with himself over the pat on the back they were giving him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In our leadership there is a splendid harmony,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Zlatic. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us take the relations between Tito and Kardelj. Comrade Tito has the class instinct and Kardelj relies heavily on this instinct.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     What he was hinting at was self-evident. But now there was no limit to their shamelessness. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After we debated for an hour or so about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>nature<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the commission and I several times heard such remarks as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you do not want to understand,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you do not want to believe<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe cleared his throat and said the final word: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I think the commission should be created as the Yugoslav comrades say. The advantages which this commission will bring us will convince any comrade who has hesitations. From our side we should appoint Comrade Pandi Kristo to engage directly in this work. Of course, Pandi has not gone deeply into economic problems but the main thing is that he has the class instinct well developed. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this situation and in these circumstances of pressure

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 426</B></FONT><P>

and blackmail we were obliged to accept Tito's first offer, the creation of the Co-ordination Commission which, however camouflaged, comprised in the Titoites' plans the initial form, or embryo, of a future government of the state of occupation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Very quickly, all the filth from this essentially neo-colonialist creation would begin to stench. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     My opinion that this commission might turn into a kind of government over the government was being confirmed completely. Krajger gathered in his hands almost all the competences of our government, signed and sealed everything which had to do with the Albanian economy and its ways of development. In the framework of the Co-ordination Commission various sub-commissions were set up, which represented duplicates of our government departments. And whereas up till now, with the earlier forms of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>collaboration<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the Yugoslavs had robbed us as thieves, from now on they robbed us openly, legally, as owners. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      In time and cautiously we were to oppose them in this field, too, but initially, when the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>economic union<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was still covered with phrases about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, our responses were limited. As soon as I mentioned to Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe any doubt or concern about the decline of our economy, he immediately tried <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to pacify<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why do you worry about the economy?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Xoxe said to me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Now that we have signed the economic treaties with Yugoslavia the aid will come. The important thing now is to prepare for the analyses of the Plenum which have remained up in the air.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Several times on end I asked Pandi Kristo to inform us how the work in the Co-ordination Commission was going, but he answered the same way as Xoxe. Indeed Pandi did not know how to put two words together, did not know how to report, therefore he said curtly: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Commander, don't you worry about the economy, because Comrade Krajger and the commission take the closest interest in it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The coming Plenum of our Central Committee, where 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 427</B></FONT><P>

the discussion would take place in the spirit of Tito's accusations, was being used by the agents of Belgrade as a means of blackmail to intimidate us and compel us to accept what they told us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile militarymen poured into Tirana as never before. Yugoslav generals, colonels, majors and captains with shining epaulets came and went in Albania as though it were their own domain. They brought with them the great <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>concern<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav leadership about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>extremely acute<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> situation abroad and about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the imminent danger<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which was threatening our countries as never before! The great noise Tito's men were making about this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>alarm<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> had been echoing in our ears for two years. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Of course, it was more than true that the situation around our countries was not calm and without dangers, but it seemed to us that all that tension and alarm in which Tito's emissaries presented the situation was unjustified. It seemed to us that things were being exaggerated. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As in all the other fields, here, too, it was soon to emerge that they were aiming at something else. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Belgrade leadership was making ready to present its next <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>offer<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. In appearance this offer had to do with the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>joint<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> defence of our freedom, but in essence it was nothing but an official demand to hand over the freedom and independence of our country as a gift to the chauvinists of Belgrade. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For years they had been trying to achieve this through the most <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>suitable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and least <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>obvious<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> ways and means, but without success. This is what had happened with their feverish efforts to take control of our army, to orientate and organize it as a part, a corps of the Yugoslav army, subordinate to the Yugoslav staff. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For us the question of the army had always been sacred, like the question of the Party itself. It had been created, organized, educated and tempered with the teachings of our Party, with the great experience of the liberation wars of our people, and with the experience of the Soviet army. In 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 428</B></FONT><P>

regard to the political, ideological and military education of our army, the problems have been decided categorically on the correct Marxist-Leninist road of our Party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The basis of our National Liberation War was partisan warfare, the fighting experience of our forefathers, which was enriched in the new conditions of a modern war, therefore, during the war we further enriched our experience with that of the revolutionary war of other peoples and, first of all, the Soviet peoples. All this experience we gathered for ourselves and elaborated for ourselves, because right through the war up to the complete liberation of Albania we had no contacts at all with the Soviet army, which did not pass through our country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, the fact is that for our army the Red Army, which was born from the Great October Revolution, was the most beloved army, and from the first days of Liberation we set ourselves the task of educating our army with lofty patriotism on the Marxist-Leninist road and with the example of the Red Army of Stalin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We began to send many cadres and militarymen who had just come through the war to <I>uchilishche </I>*, to other military schools and academies in the Soviet Union, which always accepted them and we were whole-heartedly greateful for this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We sent very few cadres to the Yugoslav military schools, because in the first years after Liberation the Yugoslavs had few such schools. They themselves, like us, sent large numbers of their sons to study in the Soviet Union. Thus we did not have obvious frictions with the Yugoslavs over this question, they did not express displeasure that we preferred the military schools of the Soviet Union and not theirs. The frictions, their anti-Sovietism and anti-Albanianism were to be displayed openly later, precisely when their bourgeois nationalist and chauvinist sentiments began to assume more marked and more numerous forms, when their megalomania,

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 429</B></FONT><P>

their sense of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>capability<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>capacity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>great and powerful Yugoslav state<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> began to be cultivated and developed. This was apparent in the military sector as in all other sectors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Taking advantage of those links which had been created during the war years between our two parties (and this we regarded as a normal and necessary thing), the Yugoslavs aimed to leave our army in a deplorable condition, without organization and without sound leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Initially we asked them to give us the regulations they had, with the aim that we would study them and adapt them to our conditions. They sent them very readily, accompanied with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>specialists on the regulations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. However, they caused us a great deal of trouble. Every three to four months the regulations were changed. The training was not carried out on a studied basis, but just as it pleased one or the other Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>specialist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The reason was not that they did not know. No, they wanted to leave our army weak and disorganized, with the aim that it would not be able to take counter-action against them later when the appropriate moment came. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     A damaging role in this situation was played by Kristo Temelko, the Director of the Political Directory of our Army, who had fought well and was sincere, but after the Berat Plenum, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo got their hooks into him, having in mind that he was of Macedonian origin, and he was implicated in the ranks of the elements who worked in favour of every <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>orientation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that came from Yugoslavia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I frequently summoned Shule and asked him angrily: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What is this? Further changes to the regulations?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't misunderstand us, Comrade Commander!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are in the first steps. We are going to build a modern army. At the time when we had none at all, the first regulations were a good step towards modernization. When the second ones came, obviously, they were improved. Later they changed them again. They work, these clever devils, rack 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 430</B></FONT><P>

their brains and regulate the regulations. There is no end to perfection, Comrade Commander!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That's all very well, there is no end to perfection, but this situation must come to an end,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What is this? As soon as our soldiers start to learn one set of regulations you replace it with another!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It's all to the good.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>this is disorganization rather than organization.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I saw that the situation was not changing and discipline was falling apart. I observed that, although I was Commander-in-Chief, I was virtually pushed to one side, in order to deal with <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the most important things<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, a little of everything. Things could not proceed in this way. Nako, as one completely involved in the game which was being played <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>far from me<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, brought me all kinds of unpleasant facts and stories which he learned from his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>men<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I was convinced that the army must be taken firmly in hand. Among the first measures which I decided to take was the reorganization of the General Staff. When we discussed this question, Nako proposed insistently that Mehmet Shehu should be placed at the head of the General Staff because he was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a born soldier, well trained, who had proved himself<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It's true he has proved himself,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told Nako, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but from two aspects, both good and bad.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As to his bad aspects I had in mind especially his sectarian acts during the war, as well as the other fact that when we had criticized him for his sectarianism, he had swung to the opposite, to opportunism. I had in mind also that he frequently acted on his own, he was conceited, demanded discipline from the others, but was not all that disciplined himself towards the line of the Party and the orders of the General Command, to the point that during the National Liberation War he did not carry out the order for the movement of the 1st  Division to the north, until he was given a second clear-cut order. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     These were the things I had in mind in regard to Mehmet Shehu's negative aspects when Nako proposed to me his 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 431</B></FONT><P>

appointment as chief of the General Staff. Of course, from what we knew of him at that period, I also took account of his positive aspects, which impelled me to believe that under the leadership of the Party he would rid himself of those negative traits which we recognized in him. Likewise, the fact that he was studying in the Military Academy in the Soviet Union added to my hope that Mehmet Shehu would strongly oppose the mish-mash which the Yugoslavs we creating in our army. With people like Tahir Kadare, Nexhip Vin&ccedil;ani and P&euml;llumb Dishnica, and some others, the situation could not be corrected. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We put forward the proposal in the Bureau and, after some minor hesitations, even Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo agreed. We summoned Mehmet Shehu from Moscow, where he was studying in the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Voroshilov<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Academy, and at our first meeting I told him about the situation in our army, related the history of the Yugoslav regulations and before I had really finished he burst out with extreme expressions as was his habit: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The brilliant military strategic art of the Red Army will find its most complete affirmation in the whole life of our army. We shall place the regulations of the Soviet Army in the hands of every soldier and will not allow even a full-stop or a coma to be altered in them. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is not what's wanted, either,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We long ago gave the orientation that we should have our own regulations, which should not be just a complete translation of the regulations of sister armies. The mistake the comrades have made up till now has been that they have based themselves only on the Yugoslav regulations which have been time after time. We must not permit such anomalies any more. Account must be taken of the Soviet regulations, first of all, and the good points of the Yugoslav regulations must be looked at, but we must work to ensure that our regulations are based on our own experience, with the objective that in the future we shall have regulations which are completely our own.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is what I wanted to say,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Mehmet Shehu. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 432</B></FONT><P>

backing down and promising solemnly: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shall decide everything in a creative way, on the basis of the line of the Party and our rich experience of the National Liberation War.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Thus, applying the Stalinist art in the organizational and ideo-political structure of the army in our conditions, we decided to adopt the Soviet military regulations as the base. At the same time we asked Stalin to send us some Soviet military advisers as well, to assist in the organization of the General Staff and the detachments. Stalin sent us good men with military and political experience. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This course which we pursued consistently did not please the Yugoslavs. They considered themselves <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>insulted<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and their military attach&eacute; and his aides slandered and criticized everything and incited our officers against the Soviet advisers, the Soviet regulations and the Soviet experience. A certain Spiro Serdjentic, a Yugoslav officer who had come allegedly to exchange the political experience of the Yugoslav army with the Political Directory of our Army, but who in fact maintained contact with Kristo Themelko, P&euml;llumb Dishnica, etc., displayed special activity in this anti-Albanian and anti-Soviet campaign. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Although we attacked them, these actions were being carried out continuously, reaching the point when some of the Yugoslavs, beginning from the main ones, like Ambassador Josip Djerdja and Tito's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>adviser<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to us Savo Zlatic, etc., were so blinded by indignation that they took our officer comrades who had graduated from the military schools and returned to their Homeland for Soviet officers, and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>complained<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to us about this large number of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Soviet advisers<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which we were bringing in. Later they made another attempt to set us on a wrong course. They summoned Kristo Themelko, Mehmet Shehu and some others to Belgrade, to a military meeting or seminar, at which Vukmanovic-Tempo (at that time political director of the Yugoslav army) presented <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the military theses of the Yugoslav army<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. After this, through Shule, they tried to persuade us that we, too, should adopt those anti-Marxist and openly anti-Soviet theses. Kristo Themelko, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 433</B></FONT><P>

indoctrinated by Tempo, came to me all enthusiasm, praised these theses to me, and proposed their adoption. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Do you have these theses written out?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I have ample notes,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied boldly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We were together with Mehmet Shehu at that seminar, we have everything noted down accurately.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Very well,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Write out these things you have presented to me, and bring them to me so that we can study them more carefully.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      A few days later Themelko brought me the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. They were the same ideas and claims which we had heard long ago about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>specific experience of the Yugoslav army in the National Liberation War<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>creative application<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of military science by Tito, about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>importance of this experience in the struggle against the stereotypism of earlier revolutions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., etc., except that now they were elevated to art, to theory. According to them, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>in the conditions of the Balkans and Europe as a whole, the experience of the October Revolution and the Red Army are no longer of value<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the new conditions are different from those of the October Revolution<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, and also because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Red Army belongs to a country which is thirty years ahead in the construction of socialism.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Thus, according to Tempo, the forms of organization and functioning of the Red Army were allegedly unsuitable for us! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      After I carefully studied the Yugoslavs' <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>theses<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I summoned Themelko and Mehmet Shehu and gave them my clear-cut opinion: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In these theses there are incorrect, mistaken views and we must not adopt them in any way. We do not disdain any good experience,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told them, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but these theses do not contain such a thing. Then, why should we adopt their theses when we have our own and the Soviet experience?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Thus, this effort of the Titoites failed, too. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From all these stands of ours, as well as from the detailed information which they received from the sources of the secret agency which they had created, the Yugoslavs were convinced that they could not use our army as a blind tool 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 434</B></FONT><P>

to realize their secret aims. So they changed their tactics.  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      In July 1947, a big Yugoslav military delegation headed by Vukmanovic-Tempo and Koca Popovic (the former, political director and the latter, chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army) came to Albania and held intensive discussions with our representatives, Kristo Themelko, Mehmet Shehu, etc. During those days I was preparing to go to Moscow and when we returned, Mehmet Shehu and Kristo Themelko came to inform me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The talks gave brilliant results,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Mehmet Shehu. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Yugoslav comrades take a serious view of the alarming situation in the Balkans and proposed to give us major supplies of military material, all-round aid and mutual collaboration in all sectors of defence.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What is meant by this collaboration?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>More or less like the collaboration in the other sectors. 'The spirit of the Economic Convention should be extended to the army, too,' Tempo told us. They proposed concrete measures about raising the efficiency of the army, about the extension of military projects, about equipment, communications, clothing, etc. In short, we should have a bigger army, better equipped technically, better clothed, shod and fed. That is, a modern army. We are defining the concrete measures for this major undertaking.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>All these things are necessary,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told Mehmet Shehu, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but you must bear in mind our conditions. Can our economy cope with all these demands immediately?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You must not worry about this. In the spirit of the Convention, the Yugoslav comrades agreed to cover our expenditure in the army with their budget!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This seemed to me extremely suspect. The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friends<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> who were fulfilling almost nothing of what they had undertaken in the economic sectors were now becoming extremely generous in regard to the army! And when Kristo Themelko considered it <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>necessary<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to add to what Mehmet Shehu said, my doubts and worries were further reinforced. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The Yugoslav comrades are going to treat our army the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 435</B></FONT><P>

same as their army!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> added Shule. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Tempo said that in the spirit of the Economic Convention, while unifications in the economy are important, the unification of our armies is just as important, if not more so!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What? What is this unification of the armies?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked shocked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He did not say that, I did not hear it!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Mehmet Shehu intervened quickly when he saw how shocked I was. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He spoke about the extension of the spirit of the Economic Convention to the army, too,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Themelko replied quietly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We were together in all the talks and we agreed to everything. What is the Economic Convention? The unification of prices, equalization of currencies, customs union. I understand this spirit in the army as unification of armies.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Did Tempo say this or is this how you understood it?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked, looking at him sternly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Perhaps I have confused the matter,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> mumbled Shule. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>'Perhaps I have confused the matter', you say,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I retorted angrily. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why don't you rather say that you saw the relations between our armies as those between the lek and the dinar?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Mehmet Shehu <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>declared<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> once again that this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>has not been said<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. This <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>would be a mistake<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Shule should not make naive comparisons<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This problem was closed, considering it a blunder of Shule. However, immediately after the accusations which Zlatic communicated to us in November, we heard with shock and regret and were finally convinced that what Shule <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>had thought<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but Mehmet Shehu allegedly <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>had not heard<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>(!) in July, was more than true. The Yugoslavs quite openly demanded the unification of our armies, that is, the placing of our army under the general command of the Yugoslav army. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      During one of those days Mehmet Shehu came to me and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Commander, in the General Staff we are quarrelling because there is talk about the unification of the two commands of our armies and the Yugoslavs want to eliminate you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 436</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    These were the moments after Nako Spiru's suicide, the moments when Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe had drawn his sword and was brandishing it left and right. In the analyses which we were making, amongst other accusations raised were those about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unsatisfactory situation in the army<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, especially in the General Staff, about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the stereotype spirit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in which we were educating the army (!), about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the underestimation of the military experience of the Yugoslav comrades,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Initially these attacks were made by <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>criticizing<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the chief of the General Staff Mehmet Shehu. Especially in a number of people in the Political Directory of the Army with whom the Yugoslavs were in direct contact, such a feeling was crystallizing, not only against Mehmet Shehu, but also against me. This was still not being done openly, but indirectly that is where it led, because it turned out as if I had proposed Mehmet Shehu as chief of the Staff, and supported him, etc. On the other hand, since I was Commander-in-Chief, now that it was said that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>things are not going well in the General Staff,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> this was a direct attack against me for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>permitting<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> this situation! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Mehmet Shehu, who felt that his position was shaky, to save himself from this situation <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opposed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the Yugoslavs openly (later I shall relate what this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>opposition<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was), and tried to gain my backing and support. His statement that, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Yugoslavs are trying to eliminate you<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, did not surprise me at those moments, because we were at the climax of the analyses in the Bureau, but nevertheless I asked him in what direction he saw this thing. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>General Hamovic, Tempo's deputy, has come with a group of militarymen and they are demanding, not only the unification of our armies, but also the creation of a unified command which will direct the activities and training of the unified army,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> explained Mehmet Shehu. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I opposed them openly,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he added. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I took a very serious view of the information which Mehmet Shehu gave me, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>informed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe about this, too, and told him we should organize a meeting in which, in the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 437</B></FONT><P>

presence of Mehmet Shehu and Kristo Themelko, Hamovic should make the ideas of the Yugoslav leadership <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clearer<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The meeting was held, but Hamovic did not take part. He had gone to inspect the detachments personally and to make contact with the various chiefs of our army! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Mehmet Shehu has been hasty in the conclusion which he draws and in all the information which he has given you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Shule attacked him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We were going to inform you about everything they said at the meeting, but the matters have still not matured.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What? Do you think that I should be informed when you have decided everything? Such a thing is not permitted in any sector, least of all in the army!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told Themelko. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are right, Comrade Commander, but we are in the phase of discussion. You are occupied with other work and Mehmet Shehu is manoeuvering to confuse us, just as his friend Nako Spiru did. It has not been said that you should be eliminated. You remain Commander-in-Chief.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Whether or not I remain, neither you, I, nor Hamovic decides this. The Party, the representative organs of the people in power decide this!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said to him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The placing of our army under the Yugoslav command leads you to my conclusion,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> put in Mehmet Shehu. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Who said that the command would be Yugoslav?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exploded Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It will be a joint, unified command.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You, too, have been informed about this?! How is it that you did not inform me?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked Xoxe immediately. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He was nonplussed for a moment but now he had become a master of escaping from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>check-mate<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No! After you spoke to me yesterday I was worried and asked Shule. He made things clear to me.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was plain that he was lying, but now lies and deception were becoming a system and it was in vain to try to discover the roots of them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They are only some ideas, Comrade Commander, which apply not only to us, but also to the Bulgarian army.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> The- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 438</B></FONT><P>

melko tried to calm the atmosphere. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shall present the platform of unification to you when the idea is properly worked out. Mehmet Shehu is trying to split us with the aim of covering up his own mistakes. Since he became chief of the General Staff he has done nothing but damage. There is no harmony between the General Staff and the Political Directory. Mehmet Shehu wants to do everything himself, elbows other comrades out and offends people over nothing. Now he tells you that allegedly 'you are being eliminated', but when we were in Belgrade he himself eliminated you.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Kristo Themelko be careful about what you say!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> shouted Mehmet Shehu angrily. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are lying to the Commander for evil aims!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Do you remember what you said to Comrade Tito when we met him in Belgrade?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Shule, quite unperturbed. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>'Under the leadership and supreme command of Comrade Tito our armies will become invincible'! That is what you said!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Mehmet Shehu's face turned red and he did not know what to say. Then he muttered: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That was a toast! Exaggerated things are said in toasts. And I proposed a toast to Comrade Enver, too. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't talk to us about toasts here,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interrupted Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>And you, Mehmet Shehu, pull yourself together. With these things that you are saying you will further alienate us from friendly Yugoslavia! When you go to Belgrade you butter up Tito, here you do the same thing with the Commander. You are dishonest with both of them. I know you very well, I know you inside out, just as I knew Nako Spiru.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Mehmet Shehu turned pale and seemed frozen to the spot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are going to look into your work carefully,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Ko&ccedil;i, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>because the Plenum is coming up. We shall settle all these things at the Plenum.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      A few days later, at a joint meeting of the General Staff and the Political Directory of the Army, Mehmet Shehu was faced with the full attack. There were plenty of grounds 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 439</B></FONT><P>

on which to catch him in mistakes, all of them were gathered up against him, they were labelled as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Yugoslavism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the proposal to discharge him from the function he held was presented to the Political Bureau! In the existing situation the opinion of the Bureau in this case, too, was to be just a matter of form. Everything had been predetermined outside the Bureau. At the end of December 1947 Mehmet Shehu was replaced by Beqir Balluku. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was quite obvious that things were on the decline in the army, as in all other sectors. I was fully convinced that the question of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unification<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unified command<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was not an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>idea in the process of elaboration,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> as Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Kristo Themelko tried to present it, but a clear-cut demand. At that period, Kristo Themelko and the new chief of the General Staff Beqir Balluku were summoned to Belgrade allegedly for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>preliminary discussion and consultation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but it seemed to me that all this was a manoeuvre which was fraught with other dangers. I felt that it was absolutely necessary to have a quiet consultation with our comrades, but Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo did not agree that we should engage ourselves on a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>project<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> when we had more <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>important[<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt; (?) -- <I>DJR</I></FONT>] things in front of us -- <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the deepening of the analyses for the Plenum<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! I wanted to consult the Soviet comrades, too, but Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe leapt up in the air as if he were stung by a wasp: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Consult the Soviets?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he cried. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In no way! We are not clear yet and we will confuse the VKP! Let us wait to hear what the comrades have to tell us when they return from Belgrade, and then see what to do!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Eventually the comrades returned. Only this time they were neither alone nor empty-handed. With them came a Yugoslav general with a resounding name, which when you heard it, created the impression that hob-nailed boots were marching <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>crunch-crunch<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> on the cobblestones. This was General Kupresanin. He had brought a whole suite of colonels and majors and an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>extremely urgent and important<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> message for me from Tito personally. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 440</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    As far as I remember, I received them the day following their arrival in Tirana. We exchanged the usual greetings and the General started directly into his theme: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On the special order of our supreme commander, the Minister of People's Defence, Marshal of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, I have come to you to bring a series of proposals of exceptional importance. What I have to communicate to you, as well as information about my identity, is communicated officially and in detail in this personal letter from Comrade Tito. Allow me to hand it to you!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He rose to his feet, stood to attention, took one step forward and held out the envelope to me, all solemnity, as if he were presenting his letter of credentials. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Now allow me to communicate to you orally the purpose of my dispatch here so unexpectedly. The situation around us presents greater threats than ever. We have information that in Greece the preparations are being completed for an attack which will be aimed initially against your southeastern borders.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He was silent for a moment, and then said to the Yugoslav officer whom he had with him: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The map!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Immediately a big map of the Balkans on which arrows, circles, flags and all kinds of other multi-coloured lines struck the eye was unrolled. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is envisaged that the attack will begin in this territory,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Kupresanin, pointing to the border in the Kor&ccedil;a-Erseka zone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We have information also that simultaneous attacks may begin from the sea. The Greek aggressive forces, supported by the Anglo-American forces and means, will try to smash your defence with a rapid general assault and then penetrate in depth. . . In these conditions, our leadership, extremely worried and loyal to its obligations under the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Aid, considers that a series of urgent measures should be taken. In regard to the main one, I shall cite textually what Comrade Tito writes to you in the letter I handed to you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Kupresanin. He opened his brief-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 441</B></FONT><P>

case, took out a sheet of paper and began to read: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Because of such an unclear situation, I beg you to give us the base in Kor&ccedil;a for one division and for the auxiliary technical units. In this way the possibility will be created for you to secure the sector in the direction of the sea better and, in case of a provocation, our units will be able to intervene more quickly.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp441">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is the main and urgent proposal of the Yugoslav leadership,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Kupresanin. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>At the meeting they had with Comrade Tito, Comrades Balluku and Themelko agreed and, convinced that you would have no opposition either, I and the group which accompanies me came to begin work immediately. We will leave urgently for Kor&ccedil;a to examine the terrain and see where our first division will be deployed. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I must interrupt you, General,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito's proposal is of such importance that it can never be passed over with a casual communication.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Everything I said you have there in writing from Tito himself!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Kupresanin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This I believe,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but we have just heard it. We must study it, discuss it in the leadership of our Party and state and then we shall give you our reply.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How is it possible!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Kupresanin in <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>astonishment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Your comrades who are engaged directly with the army showed themselves extremely ready and reasonable.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No one has authorized our comrades to approve a proposal of any kind whatever without first having the opinion of the leadership of our Party and my opinion as Commander-in-Chief,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Moreover, such an action, if not carefully weighed up, may create great problems.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The course you suggest could be followed,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> persisted Kupresanin, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but bear in mind the situation. We can wait for your analyses, but will the enemy wait until you are convinced?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 442</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Whether or not we are convinced,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>this will emerge in the end. As for the enemy, first, I think that in this situation, they have no possibility to attack us. Second, even if they do attack us, we are capable of dealing with them ourselves.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I brought the assessment of our leadership which has ample information about these preparations. Do you not believe this?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You may have this information,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but one thing is now well known: a general offensive of the patriotic forces has just been launched in Greece and the government army is engaged in fighting them.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us assume that this is so! What is wrong with our taking preliminary measures?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Kupresanin tried to persuade me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There are several things wrong with it,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said curtly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>First, we, for our part, cannot approve such an action without thrashing it out well in our leadership and I tell you that I, as Commander-in-Chief, do not agree. Second, this hasty action would create great concern amongst our people.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito has foreseen this,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the General interrupted me, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and here is what he writes in the letter: 'I think that all these actions should be carried out quietly and unnoticed.' We have instructions to organize everything in secrecy with out it coming to the ears of the people.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>And you believe that this is possible?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Do you think that the people are goats? Indeed, even if we were to agree to your proposal we could not take any action without first explaining it to the people and convincing them. The people have the right to call us to account and to reject an action which does not seem right to them. Third,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>such an action would increase the tension of the situation in the Balkans and in the international arena. The enemies would begin to speak in the way that suits them.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito has foreseen this, too,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Kupresanin, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and he writes in his letter: 'The enemy will learn of such a thing, but when our units are established there we have 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 443</B></FONT><P>

no reason to keep it secret, because this will show that our alliance is not a formal thing, but, on the contrary, that we are definitely determined to defend our borders together.' Indeed, Comrade Tito thinks that after the division is established in Kor&ccedil;a,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> continued Kupresanin, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>if the press asks you or Comrade Tito about it, you should declare that 'this base has been given by agreement for the needs of the security, not only of the Albanian borders, but also of the Yugoslav borders.'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp443">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade General,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we have discussed this more than was necessary. We heard your communication and we have Tito's letter. Now let the responsibility rest upon us. We shall give you our reply at the proper time. This is for our good and for yours.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The best thing would be for the division to be placed as quickly as possible with the aim that reaction should not have any possibility to undertake any act for the occupation of your country!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> persisted Kupresanin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But the worst thing would be if, from such a precipitate action, enemies or friends were to accuse us that Albania has been occupied by the Yugoslav troops!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied to the General and I saw that momentarily he went completely pale. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      With this the meeting came to an end. We parted very coldly with Kupresanin and as he was leaving he asked me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Will you be very long in giving your answer?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I believe it will be given at the proper time!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied frigidly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, who had been standing there like a black monk throughout the debate, intervened and said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The situation is very alarming, Comrade Enver, and we should not put off this internationalist aid of the Yugoslav brothers.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Kupresanin's face immediately brightened and he stood staring at me, awaiting my reply.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If the situation is so alarming,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told Ko&ccedil;i in a loud voice so that Kupresanin would hear clearly, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>then, let the Yugoslavs deploy their army close to the north of Greece within their own borders.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     General Kupresanin could not control his anger, he muttered something and departed. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, trying to appear <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>calm<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and extremely <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>concerned about the situation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, said to me: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It seems to me that you were hasty. Comrade Kupresanin will notify Comrade Tito and open up problems for us.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What they are demanding is extremely dangerous and delicate. I gave him my opinion, convinced that the Bureau will be of the same opinion.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>All right, let us meet and decide today or tomorrow!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> implored Xoxe. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No! The coming of the Yugoslav division is not a matter to be decided hastily here and now. It is a decision of importance for our future and the future of our friendship with Yugoslavia,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said in such a tone as to convince him that I would not budge from this. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I think that they, too, are concerned about our friendship,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> added Ko&ccedil;i. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Is it a small thing for Yugoslav soldiers to come and be killed to defend our borders? Our divisions did this when they went to the aid of Yugoslavia.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That was a different situation. Then we were in hot pursuit of the Germans. Who are the Yugoslav soldiers going to pursue here?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They will be the first to meet the Greeks if they attack us,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Xoxe. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If the Greeks attack us, let us meet the first assault. The friends can help us if they are concerned about the freedom and independence of Albania,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied and shook hands with him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Well, well, but I say we should raise the matter in the Bureau as quickly as possible,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Xoxe as he was leaving. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We cannot keep Tito waiting.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 445</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Convinced that we were facing a great danger with the bitterest consequences, I decided to carry out an action solely <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>on my own responsibility<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for the first time. Through the Soviet embassy I informed Stalin about what Tito demanded of us and, while awaiting the reply, with great effort I managed to postpone raising in Bureau the proposal about the dispatch of the Yugoslav division for the time being. To this end I exploited a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>favourable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> circumstance: the decision to summon the meeting of the 8th Plenum of the CC of the Party at the beginning of February. I say a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>favourable circumstance<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> because both the Yugoslavs and their agents amongst us, following the suicide of Nako Spiru, gave this meeting exceptional importance. They had made all their preparations to ensure that the Plenum officially endorsed the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>correctness<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Tito's accusations against us and adopted the line of the unification of Albania with Yugoslavia. It was not fortuitous that the proposal about the deployment of the Yugoslav division was made on the eve of the Plenum. This was done with the aim that, under the pressure of severe measures which the Plenum was clearly going to take, we would accept the Yugoslav military intervention in Albania without raising our voice in opposition. At the same time, the urgent dispatch of Yugoslav troops to our territory would serve as open blackmail to ensure that matters in the Plenum would go in the way that suited the Yugoslavs. Thus, we would find ourselves between two powerful fires, the measures of the Plenum and the intervention of the Yugoslav army, which would create an insurmountable situation for us: this is precisely how I assessed the situation, and therefore, taking account of all the consequences, I insisted that one of these two evils should be averted. Since it was impossible to avert the holding of the Plenum at those moments, I thought that I should strive to avert the dispatch of the Yugoslav division, and in this I succeeded. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Stalin's reply came very quickly, a few days before we began the proceedings of the Plenum. Stalin told us that he did not see any possibility or danger of an eventual attack 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 446</B></FONT><P>

against us by the Greek army and was in agreement with my opinion that the dispatch of the Yugoslav division to Albania was not necessary. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The Yugoslavs were furious when I communicated to them that, not only we, but also the Soviet comrades and Stalin personally did not consider the dispatch of their division in order, but nevertheless, they <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>retreated<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and, temporarily, said no more about this. The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>concession<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was made, because both the Yugoslavs and their agents still thought that they had everything going their way and matters would proceed as they had foreseen. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Hence, we were left to await the vicious attacks which the 8th Plenum of the CC of the Party would make upon us.

A black stain on the history of our Party

     The leadership in Belgrade and their agents in our ranks based great hopes and aims on the 8th Plenum of the CC of the CPA. There they aimed to crown the plot they had been working on for many years for the final subjugation of the CPA, to put our Party in such a position that it would endorse <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>itself<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>with its own mouth<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> what Tito and company dictated. Above all, the leadership in Belgrade aimed that the 8th Plenum of the CC of the CPA would create that situation in which, as soon as the signal was given, our Party would be obliged to accept and sign the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unification<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, or more correctly, the annexation of Albania by Yugoslavia. After this, according to the Titoites, everything would be settled easily: our Central Committee, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>of its own free will<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, would put to the People's Assembly <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>its proposal for the unification of Albania with Yugoslavia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the deputies <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>would do what the Party told them<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and, willingly or not, would raise their hands in approval. The ceremonies would take place full of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>enthusiasm<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>joy<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the world would learn the great 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 447</B></FONT><P>

news that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Albania, of its own will and on its own insistent demand, has become part of Yugoslavia<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Whether the others would be astonished at, would rejoice over or object to this news, would no longer matter to Tito. With our <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>decisions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in his hands, he knew that he would be able to prevent anyone who might raise any opposition to taking any action. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In order to make this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>beautiful dream<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Tito's a reality, first of all, the 8th Plenum of the CC of the CPA must at all costs first reject the former line, the defenders and appliers of it, and adopt the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>new<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> pro-Yugoslav line, the line of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unity and fraternity<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>! The Yugoslav leadership did not send or even ask permission for any of its representatives to take part in this Plenum. Everything was left for us to do <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>ourselves<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with the aim that they would have <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clean<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> hands in regard to what was to take place. But the truth is that, while withdrawing to the background themselves, the Yugoslav leaders launched their agents into activity, of course, instructing and guiding them in every step. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     One of the main orientations which the Yugoslavs gave Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and company at these moments was to display caution in the direct attacks which they would make against the main comrades of our leadership. This is the reason why the open attack was concentrated, at first, on Nako Spiru and two or three people around him, while in regard to the others, and especially me, they were reserved and did not come out openly. This was the diabolical tactic of taking the Albanian castle step by step, by stages, indeed, if possible, by deceiving some in order to launch them into the attack against the remainder. The Yugoslavs proved to be past masters of conspiracy, especially in the manner in which they were to operate against me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The very development of events had put them in such a vortex that now, in the interests of their final plan, they were obliged to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>retain<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> me by all means in the leadership and, in deed, to retain my <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>friendship<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> at a time when, for them, I should have been eliminated as early as 1944! This was the only 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 448</B></FONT><P>

way in which their plan for the usurpation of Albania could be achieved without rifts, without suspicions, without objections and opposition, both from our Party and the Albanian people and from the world abroad, communist and non-communist. Otherwise, if in the suitable circumstances created for any sort of crime in November and December 1947, the attack were concentrated openly upon me and I were removed from the duties with which I had been charged, or if this were impossible, if I were wiped out, then the Yugoslav plan of usurpation would have been placed in the dock. The annexation would immediately have been linked with the preliminary attack upon and elimination from the scene of the General Secretary of the Party, the Prime Minister and the Commander-in-Chief of the Albanian Army, and automatically the crime would have become more than evident. The leadership in Belgrade would have been faced with the grave and irrefutable accusation that it annexed Albania through a coup d'etat by means of a plot and a hideous crime. This would bring them irreparable damage inside and, especially, outside Yugoslavia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      In Belgrade they calculated this well. Therefore, contrary to their long-standing desire to remove me from the scene as quickly as possible, contrary to the brutal impatience of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe to seize all the reins as quickly as possible, the Yugoslav leadership was obliged <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>not to touch me<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>not to remove me<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> from the posts which I held for the time being, until the linking of Albania with Yugoslavia had become a <I>fait accompli.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      On this account, however, the problem presented many dangers for the conspirators of Belgrade, therefore, all their attention was concentrated on keeping me under surveillance by their agents and in complete isolation, on the creation of such a situation in which, while officially I would be General Secretary of the Party, in fact, I would have no power, either in the leadership of the Party, or in the Party as a whole, where the organizational secretary, the Yugoslav agent Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, would do as he pleased; officially, I would be Prime 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 449</B></FONT><P>

Minister, too, but in fact, the state power would be manoeuvred and directed by the Co-ordination Committee or Commission in Belgrade; officially, I would be Commander-in-Chief also, but in fact, our army would be directed by a Unified Command with J. Broz Tito as the Commander-in-Chief. In brief, the chiefs of Belgrade had to keep me in my former posts at those moments as a very effective disguise to legalize and conceal from the public the terrible crime they were preparing against Albania. Afterwards, everything would be easily settled: the UDB of Rankovic, the counter-part of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe in Belgrade, had become masters of the most hideous crimes from the elimination of somebody without a trace to pinning of a high decoration precisely in that place where a little earlier those same hands prepared to plunge the dagger or the bullet. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I shall never forget those difficult times when, in complete isolation and convinced I was in the centre of the attack, I was obliged, among other things, to stand up to the endless provocations of Tito's emissaries and their agents. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     During those days Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, in particular, operated with all his ability as a conspirator to compel me to act in accord with the interests of the leadership in Belgrade. On one of these days Xoxe, swarthy, short, podgy, with bulging eyes like those of a frog, came to me and with his cynical smile said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We must put out a magazine of friendship with Yugoslavia, because it has great importance, especially at these moments. You should write a warm leading article about our vital relations with the Yugoslav friends, about their aid, and especially about the contribution of the Comrade Marshal.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He went on to give me some <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>guidelines<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> on how the magazine should be and what my article should contain and from all he said I understood what was the problem worrying him and those who had given him the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>guidelines<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: the Yugoslavs needed my article to have it as a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>certificate of good behaviour<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for Yugoslavia and Tito. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 450</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Making a cool assessment of the grave situation which had been created for us, as well as of the extremely delicate and difficult problems we had to solve, I <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>agreed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to the publication of the magazine and to write the article which he sought from me. Xoxe's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>magazine<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> eventually came out (in November 1947, I think), including my article, in which, in very general terms and with the odd <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>fact<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> from the first years of the war, I pointed out the links and friendship between our parties and countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, even with this, the Yugoslavs and their agents were satisfied: the important thing for them was that the General Secretary of the CPA should write even one good phrase, even in completely general terms, about Tito's Yugoslavia, as a safe-conduct pass for the annexation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile, in our Political Bureau the problems were simmering and, time after time, cautiously but insistently, I told Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe that we must rely not on the Political Bureau and the Council of Ministers only, but must also inform the comrades of the Plenum of the Central Committee and the other main cadres of the state. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In no way!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> objected the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>organizational man<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The comrades should not be informed because they will make a mess of things. We should go into matters thoroughly in the Bureau, consult with the Yugoslav friends and call the Plenum together when everything is ready.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It would be better if we discussed matters quietly with the comrades, or at least some of them<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They have their own opinion, they know the situation where they work and their judgement would be of great assistance in arriving at the most accurate and correct conclusions.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Organizationally, that would be a breach of the rules<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> objected Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe categorically. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We must not bring things out prematurely. There are only seven or eight of us in the Bureau and we can't agree, let alone if we introduce others. The Plenum will dance to the tune of the Bureau only when the Bureau comes to one opinion. Otherwise, the Plenum 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 451</B></FONT><P>

becomes a mess and it manoeuvres us instead of us manoeuvering the Plenum.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was impossible to convince him that the manner in which we were acting was a grave mistake with serious consequences. Like the Yugoslav leadership, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe had alien Trotskyite and anti-party views about the Party and even about its Central Committee. For him, too, the base of the Party and the Central Committee itself was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the mob<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the claque<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which must do what the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>top leadership<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the Bureau, and especially <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the strong hand<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the Political Bureau, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe himself, told them. This concept of the Party was more suitable to the Titoite plan of the usurpation of Albania, because in this way, according to them, by having the Bureau with them, they would have the whole Central Committee and indeed, the whole Party <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>with them<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Another measure, which Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Pandi Kristo, etc., instructed by their master, Aleksandar Rankovic, took at this period, had to do with stepping up the psychological pressure by means of surveillance, etc., over all the links of the Party and the organs of the state. Although such anti-Party, Trotskyite methods had long been used by Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe in secrecy, now, on the eve of the Plenum, they became the only form of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>work<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. The threats and blackmail were quite open. The suicide of Nako Spiru, the violation of the most elementary organizational rules in the Political Bureau and the Central Committee, the arbitrary dismissal from their functions of a number of comrades for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Yugoslavism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, indiscriminate arrests, the great influx of Yugoslav militarymen, the pressures and threats <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>from above<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for even the slightest attempt to argue with the Yugoslav technicians in regard to the work, the loud propaganda that was made of everything Yugoslav, etc., etc., were creating great psychological pressure and a grave atmosphere everywhere. In this same spirit, in order to prepare and work on the cadres of the Party in advance, at the end of December 1947, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe delivered a speech to a meeting of activists, called in the Party School, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 452</B></FONT><P>

where he was supposed to deliver a lecture, but in fact, presented the whole platform of the Yugoslavization of Albania. This disgusting speech, prepared by the Yugoslav embassy in Tirana, was also to comprise the platform of the 8th Plenum of the CC of the CPA. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile, behind the scenes, a number of elements of the CC of the CPA, the organs of the state and of the army, like Xhoxhi Blushi, Nesti Kerenxhi, P&euml;llumb Dishnica and others, were worked on intensively and secretly in order to totally implicate them, too, in the plot. They were instructed in detail in what they had to do and at the beginning of February 1948 the Yugoslavs judged that everything was ripe: the 8th Plenum of the CC of the CPA was summoned and began its proceedings. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From the moment the proceedings opened, the majority of the comrades of the Central Committee were confronted with a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>new rule<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: although the Plenum was summoned over problems of very great political importance, it had not been considered <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>reasonable<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to present any report! A so-called conclusion of a meeting of the Political Bureau was read to them and, to their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>astonishment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the organizational secretary of the Party, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, did the reading! It was quite obvious that the General Secretary of the Party had been pushed aside. Why?! Automatically, everything was linked with the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conclusions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe read. Although my name was not mentioned there, it was made clear to all that I stood behind <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the anti-Yugoslav clique<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Nako. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     There is no need to speak here about the content of these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conclusions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, because I would be repeating all that I wrote above when Zlatic presented Tito's accusations to us.<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> The only difference had to do with the changing of the pronouns and the person of the verbs: from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you have violated the spirit of the agreements<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> it had become <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we, under the pressure of Nako Spiru, have violated the spirit. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>your

anti-Yugoslavism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> it had become <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the anti-Yugoslavism of our comrades. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Immediately after the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conclusions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, which completely disorientated and shocked the comrades, the discussion began. Measures had been taken to ensure that everything would go like <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clockwork<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, moreover, apparently, without <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>pressure<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>dictate<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> from the Bureau! The <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>claque<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> -- Nesti Kerenxhi, P&euml;llumb Dishnica, etc., took the floor. In two words they expressed their indignation over <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>those who have damaged our relations with the Yugoslav brothers<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, expressed their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>solidarity with the measures to strengthen these relations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and, after this, their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>free will<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> led them to other paths: the attacks and accusations from purely personal positions against Nako Spiru and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the clique around him<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> burst out. Precisely this was the main mission with which these elements had been charged by Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo. That is, they had to distract the spirit of the discussion away from the main problems which presented themselves about Albanian-Yugoslav relations, because if they were to dwell on them at length, there was the risk that, willy-nilly, the truth might come to light. Hence, from the first session of discussion, instead of saying whether or not the accusations of the Yugoslav leadership against our leadership were correct, whether or not our draft-plan was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>autarkic<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., etc., the Plenum took another course: everything was centred on <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>biographical investigations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about one or the other, on unheard of accusations and concocted slanders, on competing to see who could bring up most facts about what Nako or this or that person had said in such and such a year, in such and such a place, to such and such a person. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In order to put the seal of approval on this unhealthy spirit, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe got up and in his contributions to the discussion and endless interventions he related tales with the same zeal that is shown for swapping yarns in cafes. In order to make his speech <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>interesting<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, one of those who took part in the discussion was saying that nothing else could be ex- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 454</B></FONT><P>

pected from Nako because <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>he was a son of a bourgeois and behaved with Albania like his father with the <I>'Stamless </I>'<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp454">1</A>]</FONT> in Durr&euml;s<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Immediately after this, Xoxe jumped up and said to me Plenum: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That's just how he behaved, but those comrades who permitted him to do so must also bear the blame. He did not get away with these things with me. You know what I did to him once? I caught him in the corridors of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      'What are you doing here,' I demanded in a loud voice. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      'I've come to talk with you,' he replied. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      'Get out and don't let me see you here again, you've no right to set foot in the Ministry of Internal Affairs!' I told him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     'I'm a member of the Political Bureau,' the scoundrel replied without the slightest shame. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      'Whoever you are,' I said to him, 'the Ministry of Internal Affairs is not the place for conversations but for other work. However, if that's what you've come for, then stay!' That's what I did to him,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> concluded Xoxe, laughed for a moment and then became serious again. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If we had closed the door to him everywhere then he would not have done all those evil things against us. Let the comrades speak for themselves and make criticism and self-criticism.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Here I mentioned only one instance, but the Plenum was full of such things from beginning to end. And all these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>tales<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> were incorporated in an absurd manner as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, and especially <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Yugoslav<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> manifestations. This <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Yugoslavism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was portrayed as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Marxism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-socialism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and even <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Sovietism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. It was said that to be opposed to close relations, opposed to links with Yugoslavia means to be <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-socialist, anti-Marxist, anti-Party, anti-

Albanian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> -- all the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>antis<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. This villainous manner of presenting the issue brought about that the judgments of many comrades who, in essence, were not bad at all, had no anti-party tendency, were led into errors and saw matters from this angle. Indeed, when some comrade spoke about the work in general, Ko&ccedil;i and his henchmen immediately interrupted: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If you have something to say, speak concretely!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Naturally, there was plenty to be said <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>concretely<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> about Nako Spiru and his circle, because in their lives and activities they had permitted themselves grave mistakes and violations. In particular, the unhealthy ambition of Nako, his tendency and efforts to monopolize affairs, to emerge as the big shot everywhere, to gather around himself a suite of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>chosen<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> people, and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>intellectual elite<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> ready to do whatever Nako told them, these mistakes were <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>known to us and we had criticized them continuously. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In their contributions many comrades brought up new facts in these directions and many of these facts were well based. One such fact was the attempt of Nako Spiru, even after he was removed from his duties in the Youth Organization, to treat the organization as his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>personal contingent<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>detachment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the service of his ambitions. He had made similar efforts to get control of the Trade Union Organization and the Women's Organization. On his own initiative he gave these organizations <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>directives<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>orientations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which set them to the course of separation from the Party, just as he did with the Youth Organization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     One of the comrades said: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Nako came to us and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     'Look what the Youth Organization is doing! It is producing ministers, while the Party and the trade-unions are producing nothing.'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     There were many similar examples of the monopolization of work, arrogance and conceit to be found in Liri Belishova and Mehmet Shehu, also. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We had frequently criticized these elements for all these things, and if the 8th Plenum was to meet for the examination of these mistakes and alien manifestations, this would 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 456</B></FONT><P>

be more than normal. However, the 8th Plenum had not been summoned for this. Moreover, at this Plenum these short comings and weaknesses were not only inflated, added to and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>elaborated on<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in an incorrect manner, but were arbitrarily employed to prove that there lay <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Yugoslavism<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I could never reconcile myself to this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>conclusion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> arrived at for premeditated purposes through behind-the-scenes manoeuvres. The fact is that Nako and his comrades had had frictions and contradictions with the Yugoslavs, but in the instances that I knew of, I had been in agreement with them. As was clearly proved later, and as some admitted in meetings, in the final analysis they had not opposed the Yugoslavs from a principled basis and for principled aims, but had opposed the pressures and crooked aims of the Yugoslavs for their own ulterior motives. In all this distorted course which events took, it was quite obvious that following the attack on the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clique<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of Nako Spiru, the turn would come for the attack on the other sound comrades of the Party. Though not always directly, Ko&ccedil;i implied that the whole responsibility for the things Nako had done rested on me. He stated openly that Nako did what he did, since he had the support in the Bureau of the General Secretary. The things which it was not suitable for him to say himself were said by his lackeys, Pandi Kristo, Kristo Themelko, Tahir Kadare, P&euml;llumb Dishnica, Gjin Marku and others: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The terrain was being prepared for the final attack. Several times the Plenum was told insistently: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't concentrate only on the group of Nako, take your criticism of the' leadership' further, because it has great responsibility!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     To the chagrin of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, however, attacks against me did not occur. Then, Pandi Kristo got up and made a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>personal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> proposal: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us not repeat what has happened to us in the past by protecting the leadership from criticism. In the leadership there are comrades who have made major mistakes and they should be hauled over hot coals. I propose that we postpone 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 457</B></FONT><P>

the proceedings for one or two days for the comrades to reflect and prepare themselves.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Everybody understood that the request was aimed against me, first of all. However, on that plane to which they had guided the discussions, that is to accusations of arrogance, crudeness, megalomania, rumour-mongering, unhealthy ambition etc., it was difficult even for Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo, let alone the other comrades of the Party to make anything stick on me. In my life as a communist and a citizen I had never permitted such manifestations. From this aspect even the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>personal file<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, which Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe had opened on me, was certainly quite blank. Thus, even when the discussion recommenced the agents of Belgrade waited in vain for any <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>fact<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> against me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nevertheless, their insistence had its effect. The doubt was created that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>there was something wrong with me<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     During all the days of the Plenum, although <I>de jure</I> I was General Secretary of the Party, I hardly made two or three comments. The atmosphere was loaded against me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>General Ko&ccedil;i<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the saviour of the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> seemed as if he had the Plenum as his battalion and gave it orders to do what he wanted and said. I avoided intervening and facing the comrades with certain questions and facts that were simmering in my head. I thought it was neither the time nor the atmosphere. The slightest haste or tactical mistake might lead to the sacrifice of everything, and my worry was not that I would be sacrificed personally. My concern was the fate of the Party and Albania. Everything was balanced on a knife-edge. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Without dwelling any longer on the mass of accusations,  slanders and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>tales<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which were spun in the Plenum, I have to say that at the end of this Plenum the Yugoslav's theses triumphed. A number of elements in the service of the Yugoslavs, such as Nesti Kerenxhi, Xhoxhi Blushi, etc., were arbitrarily co-opted to the Political Bureau and the Central Committee. The course of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>economic union<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> with Yugoslavia was legalized, the draft five-year plan was rejected, the former line

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 458</B></FONT><P>

of the Party was rejected. The terrain was prepared for further action. At the end of the proceedings, the question of the resolution came up. I expressed the opinion that a group should be set up to formulate the resolution which should be examined in the Bureau and that the Plenum should be summoned to discuss it and give it final approval. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When do you envisage we should meet?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> someone asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The work will begin immediately, but a certain time will be needed,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I explained, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>because, as you see, the problems are very complicated.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Within a few days, indeed within a very few days, we shall organize this work and meet. We're not going to let things drag out,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> intervened Ko&ccedil;i arrogantly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The conflict was even more apparent. The comrades went away convinced that the struggle within the leadership was continuing, except that now only the final clash lay ahead. Who would triumph?! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Immediately after the 8th Plenum the meetings of activists and conferences to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>inform<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>explain<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and engage the base in the struggle against the hostile activity of Nako Spiru, etc., were commenced. They had deliberately brought into the meetings of activists those elements who had personal <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accounts<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to settle with Nako and his comrades. The anti-Party explosion became even more grave. Ko&ccedil;i and his whole band went to the meetings in Tirana like victors and I am making no mistake when I say that they were more like the infamous trials of the inquisition than meetings. Everything was presented black and grave. My name was completely eliminated. When it was mentioned on same occasion, it was simply alluded that I was the supporter of Nako Spiru and even the chief of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Party clique<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>General Ko&ccedil;i<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> was enjoying the fruits of his work. The former thick-head Xoxe (his pseudonym was Trashi [the Thick]), our ex-quartermaster of stores at Panarit, the sinister figure of the Bureau and the government, was now inflating himself like the frog in the fable. He opened and closed the 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 459</B></FONT><P>

meetings of activists. Frequently, these meetings were turned into events like the noisy press conferences of the chiefs of the bourgeoisie: a question would be asked from the floor and answered there and then by the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>competent<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> person. He was asked about everything, from the problems of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>plot<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to the situation in Honolulu and how the elections would go in Italy!<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp459">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Xoxe answered on the spot. He even defined the percentage of Italians who would vote for <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Democracy<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I shall not dwell on this euphoria, but I want to point out that both in the Plenum and in the meetings of activists, Xoxe further elaborated his former hostile ideological and political views: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The political party of the broad masses of the people, that's what the Front is,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> declared Xoxe in Tirana and continued: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The people should see in the Front the force that waged the war, that brought about the unification and is carrying out the construction of the country. . . And for this reason, the Front must really organize, equip the people with conscience and prepare them morally and politically. All this should be done under the banner of the Front, in the framework of the Front.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The forceful repetition of this anti-Marxist view at these moments had a clear purpose: according to Xoxe and to those who had taught him, our Party had done what it had to do and now it remained for the Front, that is the people, to proceed on that road which was opened, that is on the road of accepting, without opposition, any orientation which would be pronounced from <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>above<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At the same time, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe found the way to give a strong warning about the reprisals which would be launched against those who opposed him. He linked this especially with 

<A NAME="fnp459">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp &nbsp 
<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT></SUP> 
Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe's answers in such <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>meetings of activists<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and conferences, as well as his contributions to the discussion are found in the minutes kept in the CAP. 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 460</B></FONT><P>

the intelligentsia for whom he had always nurtured a visceral hatred. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The question of the intellectuals,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>is even more difficult, because the professors, doctors, engineers and others have been to school abroad. These intellectuals have never thought about the people, are not the sons of the people and have always wanted to cause splits in our country. In the case of Nako Spiru, who studied abroad and who managed to reach the leadership of our Party, we have the best example of this!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Xoxe concluded his address. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In fact, the warning had been given long before. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, under the direction of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Nesti Kerenxhi etc., had opened files, not only on all our patriotic and revolutionary intellectuals, but on all those who dared to express any opinion which was not in conformity with the Yugoslav orientation. These elements were described as <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>men of the pen<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>men of the school<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, and the club was to fall upon them. Ignorance and blind obedience -- that was what the Yugoslavs and Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe needed in Albania. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This, then, in general outline, was the 8th Plenum of the CC of the CPA which, only a few months later, we were to describe quite rightly as a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>black stain on the history of our Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For a moment this Plenum allowed the Trotskyite line of the Titoites to triumph. For a moment, the correct line, which our Party had pursued and defended, was rejected. For a moment both the Political Bureau and the Central Committee were disorientated. The skilled craftsmen of the workshop of the UDB in Belgrade, the military <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>delegates<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and diplomats of Tito and their lackeys, the clan of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, managed to push aside the General Secretary of the Party and to load the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>blame<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for many mistakes on to him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I say <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>for a moment<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, without by any means intending to underrate the great damage which this bitter event brought us, or to minimize that part of the responsibility for this, which belongs to us. No, I say this because the indisputable 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 461</B></FONT><P>

truth about this Plenum is that from the moments when it took place, the majority of the Central Committee of the Party saw and felt that a very grave mistake, a distortion with fatal consequences was being made, but matters had developed in such a way that, for the moment, the mistakes were elevated to a line. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Immediately after the Plenum the majority of the comrades, in one way or the other, openly expressed their reservations about and opposition to everything that was said and decided at the Plenum and the fact is that, despite the feverish efforts of the agents of Belgrade, the anti-Marxist spirit and line which the 8th Plenum made <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>official<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, did not extend in the Party and the life of the country. The other fact that, just three or four months after the 8th Plenum, in June 1948, our Party publicly denounced the anti-Marxist deviation of the Yugoslav leadership, also shows that the 8th Plenum of the CC of the CPA was a diabolical machination which was imposed on the Central Committee from outside. The 11th Plenum of the CC of the CPA, held in September 1948, and the 1st Congress of the CPA, held in November 1948, prove this even more clearly. Everything that had been said and decided at the 8th Plenum was unanimously and indignantly rejected. Obviously, only something which had had no real basis, something alien, imposed, false and hostile, could be rejected so quickly and with such indignation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Nevertheless, it was to take some months to re-establish the truth. At first, the situation was extremely grave, complicated and frequently there seemed to be no way out. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Soon, however, we were to see an astonishing haste in the actions and efforts of the leadership in Belgrade and their agents to get the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Albanian question<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> over and done with as quickly as possible. Their pressure and insistence on deciding things quickly, there and then, made an impression on us and we were to sense in these actions the signs of a fear which accompanied their bearers, although we still did not know the reason for and the meaning of this unexpected 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 462</B></FONT><P>

haste. We knew only that whoever is in a rush has a problem and in this rush might break his neck. Fortunately for the freedom of the people and independence of Albania, this was the fate and the finish of the anti-Albanian plot of Tito and his agents Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Pandi Kristo and company.

The Titoites' rush towards defeat

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    With the turn which events took immediately after the 8th Plenum, the possibility existed that our Albania, its war time wounds still unhealed, would fall into the clutches of a new slavery. Now, however, this slavery was not to come through aggression, but by <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>request<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, by <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>official demand<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. And this shameful act for which neither our contemporaries nor the future generations would ever pardon us, was not to be carried out and signed by a puppet parliament like that of Zog, but the danger existed that it would be carried out by our own People's Assembly under unrestrained pressure and demagogy, by <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>endorsing<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> the proposal of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Central Committee of the Party<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This is where the work of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, the blind tool of the CPY and Tito, was leading, this was the course that events took after the notorious Plenum of February 1948! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In this situation my position was grave. I was in isolation and under ceaseless surveillance. But at no time did it cross my mind to surrender. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In the first place, <B>I had confidence in the Party and its Central Committee.</B> The first wave of Xoxe's damage would subside, the comrades would see matters with cooler heads and more objectively, would reflect and take the proper stand. This would occur especially at the moments when the comrades learned that Xoxe and company were preparing to make a gift to the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yugoslav saviours<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> not of a piece of Vermosh 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 463</B></FONT><P>

or a Sh&euml;n-Naum<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp463">1</A>]</FONT>, but of the 28 000 square kilometres of Albania! I had the unshakeable conviction that this would make matters completely and finally clear, that the people would see where the traitor and bandit General was leading the country. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This would be the signal for the general alarm. The comrades would say <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>no<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and I, together with them and at their head would repulse the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proposals<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Titoite leadership. This was the first pillar to which I clung firmly with complete conviction that our cause would not be lost. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Second, even if the Party were to make the tragic mistake of accepting the distorted decisions of a disorientated leadership, <B>the people would not accept this mistake.</B> For 7-8 years on end the Party and its leadership had guided, inspired and convinced the people that for us there is no cause more lofty and sacred than the freedom, independence and progress of the Homeland. This call had been made in the years of the war and repeated whenever necessary. The heroic deeds and wars of our people for freedom and independence, even when they did not have the Party, are renowned, let alone now when they had a leading staff which had emerged from the bosom of the people and had won recognition in the flames of the war for national liberation and for a people's democratic Albania. Many times the people had risen in defence of their rights. That is why the people whole-heartedly supported the speech of the representative of the new Albanian state at the Peace Conference in Paris in the summer of 1946. In that speech there is a powerful piece about our inviolable borders. Its attack was aimed in many directions. It was a warning about the aims and provocations of the Anglo-Americans and the Greek monarcho-fascists, but was also a hard knock for any other chauvinism, hence, for the Yugoslavs, too.

The Serbian Kralj Karadjordjevic, together with Wrangel's Great-Russian bands, brought to Albania his agent -- the bandit Ahmet Zog, who, as a great traitor to the Homeland, gave Yugoslavia Sh&euml;n-Naum of Pogradec and Vermosh as a gift in return for this assistance. 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 464</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    I was convinced that if need be, the people would once again repeat with force and majesty their brilliant patriotic and fighting traditions and not allow the historical tragedies and injustices of the past to be repeated in 1947 and 1948. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     These two fundamental factors (the Party and the people) were the two powerful pillars which gave me strength, which told me to act cautiously, with patience and maturity, convinced that when I was beside them and at their head there was no force which could conquer us. Very quickly it was to be proved how correct this judgment was. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The Yugoslavs were wrong at Berat, they were wrong again now and they would be wrong in the future, precisely, because, as I said above, they had a distorted anti-Marxist concept about the party and in the first place about where it has its roots, where the source of its successes and victories lies. They thought that with some backstage manoeuvres, with some agents at the head, with the isolation or liquidation of one or the other opponent, with some blackmail and threats, they could cancel out a whole war in which the people shed a great deal of blood, in which the workers, the peasants, the youth, the women and the freedom-loving progressive intellectuals saw the road to salvation and on which they based their aspirations for a better future. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In these notes and reminiscences I am obliged to speak about and describe those things which occurred around me, about the fact that for a long time I was alone against four or five in the Bureau, about the fact that even the Plenum of the Central Committee, as at Berat and now, was somewhat disorientated by the intrigues behind the scenes and the manoeuvres of the conspirators. Let us not forget that at Berat and at the 8th Plenum some people were co-opted in crooked ways in order to strengthen the crutches of the conspirators. All these things had a negative influence on our struggle. But the fact is that when matters where taken to the Party it showed itself solid, demanded a reckoning to the end and did not permit any violation of its glorious course 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 465</B></FONT><P>

or any deviation of its future. Frequently rank-and-file members of our good people attribute to me certain merits which do not belong to me in coping with these enemies and analogous cases later. It should be understood clearly that if the enemies were unable to eliminate me at Berat and again and again later, this occurred not so much because they were afraid of me simply as a person, but rather because they were afraid of the people, of the Party and of the National Liberation Army with which we had linked ourselves in the war through a correct line, worked out and applied, not by one head, or by five or six people, but by the whole Party which was inspired by Marxism-Leninism, by all those cadres, communists or not, who gave their lives willingly. And it could not have been otherwise: tens of thousands of partisans had not fought against one slavery to enter another; the working class could not relinquish its leading role which it had won with bloodshed and sacrifice; the poor peasants did not fight to give the aghas their land, their sweat and their votes again, as Sejfulla Mal&euml;shova and others like him wanted; our patriots and intelligentsia could not accept the absurdities of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proletarian<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> mind and heart of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe who demanded that the glorious names and figures of Skanderbeg, Naim Frash&euml;ri and others like them be forgotten and wiped out. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     No, our Party and people would not and did not allow the vital victories, which the Albanian people had sought for centuries and finally had achieved with torrents of blood and sweat, to slip through their fingers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Besides these two fundamental factors, I also bore in mind that we were living in other times. We were living in the time of Lenin and Stalin, in the time when socialism was being built in a series of countries, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union led by Stalin and the communist parties of other countries were in existence, when the Information Bureau had been created, etc. Our Party was not a member of the Information Bureau, but since it was a communist party, recognized by the Comintern thanks to our struggle and efforts, I was convinced that if necessary, <B>the sister parties</B> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 466</B></FONT><P>

<B>would come to our aid.</B> I thought that it could not be only we who sensed and saw the truth about Tito, and I was not mistaken. True, the stands and actions of Tito were expressed more openly and savagely in our country, since he considered us <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>small<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and thought he could gobble us up more easily, but I had the belief that the others could not be asleep and were not blind. We had some signs and signals in this direction. I had received the first signal immediately after I had informed Stalin about the dispatch of the Yugoslav division. Stalin's reply was <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. He said nothing about Tito or the leadership of the CPY, but from his reply that, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We do not see any immediate threat from outside and hence the dispatch of the Yugoslav division does not seem reasonable to us<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, I understood that there must be disagreements between the CC of the CPSU and the CC of the CPY. Even more important, from Stalin's reply I understood that our correct opposition would not be in vain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      As I said above, I summoned Savo Zlatic and Kupresanin and told them that we did not consider it reasonable that the division should come and that for this we had also consulted with the Soviet leadership. They were soured and furious, but they had to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accept<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> our refusal, like it or not. It is not difficult to understand why this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>retreat<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> occurred. This is the manoeuvre of aggressors of all times. They <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>give way<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to the extent that is necessary, with the aim that after they blind your eyes they will hurl themselves upon you with all their fury. If they were to arrogantly insist on the dispatch of their division to Kor&ccedil;a, then the opinion that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the Yugoslavs want to occupy us<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> would become more evident and this would undoubtedly lead to opposition and matters could become badly complicated for them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      After the 8th Plenum, when they thought that the terrain was prepared for a further advance, they took another step: they decided that we should break off any contact or possibility of consultation with the Soviet comrades. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Zlatic came to me one of those days, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>congratulated<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> me on the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>success<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Plenum and said: 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 467</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You did well that you rejected the autarkic five-year plan. Now you will go ahead more easily with the one-year plan. We will give you everything, because it is a joint plan.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was sure that he had something in his mind that had brought him to me. I waited for it to come out. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Now,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>together with the five-year plan many things connected with it will be dropped, too. Now that Nako and his ideas are gone, get rid of everything else from his spirit, from the suggestions, advice and the advisers who taught him that business!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>To whom are you referring?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Please don't misunderstand me,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I say that the friendship between us and the Soviet Union should be as strong, long lasting, steel-like, honest and internationalist as possible. This is Tito's instruction, too. But now that you have quite rightly rejected Nako's autarkic plan, what are the Soviet comrade advisers going to do in Albania? They will be hurt and quite rightly so. Nako led them up a blind alley. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      He went on and on about the fact that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you have no further need<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> for the Soviet advisers, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>possibly you should let the technicians stay and work<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but without <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>us interfering with them, or they with us<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Is this Tito's instruction, too?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked in such a tone that Zlatic found it difficult to distinguish whether I was asking sincerely or with sarcasm. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito gives general instructions,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied diplomatically. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Friendship is the general consideration. But in the concrete instance what I say comes within the framework of friendship.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      On this occasion Zlatic <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>protected<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Tito, but some months later, in the self-criticism which Kristo Themelko was to make at the 11th Plenum, amongst many other things he testified as follows: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>When I went to Belgrade in March, at the reception which Tito reserved for me, he spoke to me about the Soviet advisers and asked me: 'How do you get along with them?' Influenced as I was by Ko&ccedil;i, Pandi and the Yugoslavs,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> con- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 468</B></FONT><P>

tinued Themelko, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I told him, 'We are discussing whether we should send them away, because they interfere in our affairs.' Tito said: 'We put up the money and the others poke their noses in. This won't do.'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp468">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      This occurred precisely at the time when Zlatic, for his part, asked me to send the Soviet advisers away. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Zlatic,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I do not consider your judgement correct. If Nako 'blinded' the Soviet advisers, as you say, we will know how to find a common language with them. They are very necessary to us and we have not noticed any sign of discontent amongst them.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Nevertheless, you should look into this matter,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Zlatic. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Put it forward in the Bureau and listen to the opinion of the comrades. . . !<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The need for me to do this did not arise. The threads had been co-ordinated in advance, and at the first meeting of the Political Bureau, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Pandi Kristo and Kristo Themelko said quite openly: the Soviet advisers should be sent away! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Not because we don't like them, not because they are no good, but simply because we have no need for them!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Pandi Kristo. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Moreover,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> reasoned Pandi <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>profoundly<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (he had not long begun to become something of an orator), <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to keep these valuable Soviet advisers here, where there is no work for them, is not an act of kindness and gratitude to the Bolshevik Party and the beloved country of the Soviets. Their country has great need for them, while we are keeping them here without any need at all. Therefore,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he concluded, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I propose we should put the problem to the Soviet comrades in a fraternal way, explain to them why we are taking this step and tell them this is only for the time being! Later. . . we shall see. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Later,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied and looked Pandi right in the eye, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>perhaps there will be no need for the Soviet ambassador in Tirana either!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Oh, please! If you are opposed then say so, but without irony!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> interjected Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You always speak with irony. And you should bear in mind,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he crowed, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>that the 8th Plenum put things in order and got rid of the enemies. You are offending us. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't want to offend you,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but it seems to me we are taking a bad step. To say that we have no need for the Soviet advisers means that we have no need for the advice of the Soviets, for their experience, for the great experience of that party and socialism in the Soviet Union!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't generalize quite simple things in this way!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>defended<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> himself. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are referring to a concrete matter, simply to that of the plan!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was convinced that this was not so. The problem went deeper. The demand of Zlatic and the Yugoslav agents led to that wrong anti-Soviet course on which the Titoite leaders had set out long ago. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Faced with the opposition of me, Hysni and Gogo, the remainder of the Bureau made a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>retreat<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, but on condition that in the coming days we shall thrash out this idea and decide it<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, as Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe said. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     However, when more than anything else the Yugoslavs needed quiet and secrecy for the realization of their annexationist plans, certain circumstances made them rush their activity in regard to Albania. We still did not know these circumstances, but their haste began to become quite obvious. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Kristo Themelko, who had just returned from a trip to Belgrade, came to me and said: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Even Tito received me, not to mention Comrades Tempo and Popovic! They accompanied me all day! Our relations are warm again. I secured all the aid for the army and for defence. It had never crossed my mind that they would give us so much: weapons, equipment, clothing! They told me they would even maintain our army with food. Yugoslav engineering detachments will come to build roads and bridges and other strategic projects. They will fill the whole country with steel and concrete. And the important thing is that they 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 470</B></FONT><P>

told me that all these things 'we shall include in the Yugoslav budget'.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He raised his head from his papers about <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>aid<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which he had in front of him and was astonished when he saw that I was listening to him with complete indifference.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't you believe me?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he asked. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Ask General Kupresanin and you will see!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Did they put anything else before you?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him to imply to him that we had finished.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Lots of lunches and dinners!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But apart from what I mentioned we did not speak about other problems.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I got up from my chair in order to escape the annoyance he was causing me, but he said to me:

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Commander, I have some other things on my own behalf. That reply of the Soviets still remains unclear to me. It is my opinion, but what if we ask them why they do not agree to our accepting the Yugoslav division.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Stalin's reply is clear,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There's nothing more to clarify!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>        

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Oh, very well, but it seems to me that business is still bothering the Yugoslav comrades. What if we ask Moscow to reconsider their reply once more. Perhaps they will tell us to accept the division.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We gave the Yugoslavs our reply and if they are not clear let them ask Stalin themselves!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied curtly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That doesn't seem right to me. My opinion is we should repeat the request!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was not impressed so much with Themelko's request to ask Moscow again as with his expression used in and out of place <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>it's my opinion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. I stayed to hear more. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     From his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>own opinion<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he brought out very <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>interesting<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> proposals: the creation of a unified command, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>if not for the whole army, at least for those forces which will operate together with the Yugoslav division, if we permit it to go to Kor&ccedil;a<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>; especially <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>his<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> great desire for the union of Albania with Yugoslavia as quickly as possible in a federation (!) etc., etc.

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 471</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>While I was in Belgrade this time,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he added in a hushed voice, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I learned a great secret from a very reliable source. Bulgaria is almost united with Yugoslavia. Their union is only a matter of weeks or months. My heart tells me, Comrade Commander, that we should not allow Bulgaria to leave us behind. For my part I say we should take the initiative first. Let us tell Tito to unite with us first and then with Bulgaria.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Shule has been wound up properly,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I thought very worried, but I controlled myself and asked him quietly, but with irony: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Are all these things your own opinions?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>On my honour, they are my own opinions!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>vowed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The proposals are very 'interesting'!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Write them out just as you presented them to me and we shall raise them in the Political Bureau. Let us discuss them there!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I'll do that,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Shule, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but I mentioned them to you first in order to hear your opinion. They would be more sure of acceptance if we were to present them to the Bureau as our common proposals and desire.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In no way!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Such a desire has never crossed my mind and, second, I have no reason to assume the 'merits' which belong to you! Write them out and present them yourself!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      No more than three or four days later, General Kupresanin requested a meeting with me. I received him and from his first words he began to present, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>on his own behalf<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, the same <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>desire<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and proposals which Kristo Themelko had presented to me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Right from the start I sensed that all this was organized and directed from afar, but I was astonished at the unexpected haste with which it was insisted that we should discuss and approve these proposals. My suspicions about this haste were even further increased when, two or three days after General Kupresanin, Savo Zlatic came to me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      He too began to speak about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>new spirit<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in the relations between our two countries, about the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>unprecedented 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 472</B></FONT><P>

extension<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of economic and cultural exchanges, of joint projects and plans (which had remained only on paper) etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As you see yourself,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>many problems have been created for us which we must cope with together. However, for this neither the good will nor the desire of both sides that the work should proceed well are sufficient. Like it or not, many difficulties arise. We have considered the matter thoroughly and judge that the conditions have matured for a big and decisive step. Our countries should be united as quickly as possible!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>How should they be united?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In the framework of a federation!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied quite calmly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>For years you, we and the Bulgarian comrades have been in agreement about the creation of this federation. We think that now the time has come.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There has been talk at times about a federation,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but always in principle and as a problem of the future. We, for our part, have not discussed this problem, because it was not the time and the possibilities for it did not exist. For my part, I tell you that in our conditions especially, it is still not the time to raise this problem for discussion, let alone to decide it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Our leadership judges that the time has come,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> insisted Zlatic. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I want to tell you in confidence an extremely secret thing: the Bulgarian comrades have agreed to unite with Yugoslavia and the question of our union is a matter of weeks or at the most months. I have been friendly with you for a long time and in my heart I don't want Bulgaria to be the first to take the initiative. Why don't you take this step first? This would make our special relations more evident in the international arena!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Shule came to my mind and I smiled to myself ironically. They were wound up, I thought, not only with the ideas, but even with the identical words and expressions. Meanwhile Zlatic was watching me carefully and asked:  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What do you think about it?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 473</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am listening,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>carry on!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>  

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Don't take this with fear and reservations! This is step which will certainly be taken, if not today, tomorrow'. The union of our two peoples will immediately smooth out all the difficulties which have arisen and never cease arising. The thing is who will be the first to take the initiative? Comrade Tito instructed me that it would be best if the proposal came from you. This would eliminate any suspicion that we allegedly want to include Albania in the federation.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why? Isn't what you propose inclusion?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked quietly. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why do you speak in this way?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said as if offended. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Perhaps I expressed myself badly! We want the union, but we do not want people to accuse us of doing this on our own behalf.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>                                      

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then are they to accuse us of doing this on our own behalf?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I retorted immediately. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Zlatic went pale and the words stuck in his throat. I offered him a glass of water, he swallowed a gulp and tried to smile 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I have some trouble with my throat,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>excused<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> himself. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>However, it seems that we do not easily agree with each other. You judge by my words; please judge by the essence. The matter is not that we do not want it, but that the thing will be done more easily if you make the proposal. We will immediately approve the proposal and it will all be done without problems. They have no reason to accuse you, because, as the small country you are, no one will think that you have made Yugoslavia a part of your country. In our case it is different.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Have you consulted with the Soviet leadership about this step which you suggest to us?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied all agitation. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is a problem between our two countries, between our two leadership. When we have completed everything then we shall inform the Soviet comrades. However, you did well to ask me this. I have instructions from Comrade Tito that you, too, should maintain the same stand as we do. It is not good for us to worry the Soviet 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 474</B></FONT><P>

comrades about something that we have not agreed upon between ourselves. I must tell you that we do not agree with the way in which you acted in connection with our division. However, for the sake of our friendship with the Soviet Union, we are withdrawing. But, if something occurs with the Greeks, let the proper person bear the responsibility. You should keep these two things in mind and please don't misunderstand us: first, the Soviet Union is truly our great friend, but it is far away, and in case of an aggression, it cannot come quickly to your aid; second, the Soviet Union as a big country must conduct a major international policy. On account of a very major interest, it may not be able to intervene in the case of an attack against you, may be obliged to accept the sacrifice of your country!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Clear!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said curtly, in a serious tone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>These things you put before me are the opinions of your leadership, are they not?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Of course, they are the opinions of our leadership!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Zlatic. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>And of course you have brought them to us in writing!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No. Whether they are presented in writing or orally is of no importance. I transmitted them to you quite clearly. Between friends it is not important whether things are presented orally or in writing. The important thing is that we find a common language.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      I felt the situation was reaching its climax. Tito's three envoys, wound up with the same <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>proposals<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the identical phrases, might be followed by others and exert their pressure systematically. Now the stand of our Political Bureau had decisive importance. After what occurred at the 8th Plenum our Bureau was on the side of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, both in content and in orientations. Gogo, Hysni and I were in a minority. This situation compelled me to keep cool, to manoeuvre with care so as to resist the great danger which was knocking at the door. At this time certain other doubts arose in connection with the Yugoslavs. Why were they insisting that we should not consult with the Soviet comrades? 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 475</B></FONT><P>

Could the relations between sister parties and socialist countries be called friendly and normal when they keep secrets from one another?! Apparently something is not going well between them, I judged. The monstrous judgments that Zlatic pronounced in connection with the stand of the Soviet Union in case of an aggression against us further increased this suspicion of mine. These things were not simply suppositions of Tito and company. On the one hand they were pressure and blackmail to intimidate us, but in essence they also expressed Tito's hostile stand and assessment towards the great Soviet Union and Stalin's foreign policy. Only enemies could have and express such base opinions about the Soviet Union. But this was still just my own reasoning. From the Soviet embassy we had no signal, either for better or for worse. We had to cope with everything alone. Without delay, that is, without letting matters get worse, I demanded an urgent meeting of our Political Bureau. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>These days,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said in substance, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>three comrades, Shule, General Kupresanin and Savo Zlatic have come, one after the other, asking us to propose the union of Albania with Yugoslavia. Obviously this is a step which cannot be taken lightly. The matters which they put before us cannot be solved hastily without consulting with the Party, the government and the people, without thrashing them out and discussing them in detail from every point of view. The request which is made to us cannot and must not be taken as the desire of one or the other individual. This is a major political and state problem of principle. I listened to the three comrades, but from what they told me many things remain obscure. For this reason I think that, before we discuss the matter in the Bureau, we should send Comrade Tito a letter asking him to explain to us more extensively, officially and in writing why and how he sees this step possible.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What if we listen to Shule here and try to clear things up,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> put in Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>innocently<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Perhaps it won't be necessary to write a letter to Comrade Tito.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What Shule told me was his own opinion,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied to 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 476</B></FONT><P>

Xoxe. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We can't take the desires of Shule as a message from the Yugoslav leadership. Am I not right, Comrade Kristo?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, of course, it was my opinion,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Shule blushing. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But I'm ready to explain to you anything that was unclear!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I instructed you to present your proposals in writing,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You neglected this. Likewise, neither Kupresanin nor Zlatic presented anything official. We are the Political Bureau of an independent party and we represent the interests of a sovereign state, therefore, in regard to such a problem we cannot base ourselves on what one or the other says, however trusted the comrades may be. Let us send a letter to Comrade Tito to ask him to explain to us how they see the road of unification, to explain also why they asked that the proposals should come from our side, why we should unite 'irrespective of what Bulgaria does', why they consider consultation with the Soviet comrades unnecessary, etc. I consider this a normal thing and more than necessary,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I think that Comrade Tito himself will be pleased that we want his personal judgment to have as a basis for taking a decision on such a question!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     While I was speaking the faces of Xoxe, Themelko, Pandi Kristo, Nesti Kerenxhi and others sometimes looked black, sometimes went pale from the anger simmering within them. Behind my words they saw a manoeuvre that was taking the initiative from their hands. But they had no way to oppose what I presented. Willy-nilly, they <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>agreed<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> that the discussion should be postponed until Tito's reply came. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After so many months of the savagest pressure and blackmail, for the first time I felt I could breathe a little more easily. On such a delicate and discrediting matter as the demand for the unification of Albania with Yugoslavia, Tito would hardly make so bold as to put the demand in writing. He might send us another hundred emissaries, all to convince us that they came from the same source, they might speak with identical words, but these would no longer carry any weight. The point of Archimedes had been found and estab-

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 477</B></FONT><P>

lished: we would discuss the matter in the Bureau only after Tito's official reply came in writing! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was convinced that this meant: Never! The balance was tipping in our favour. About 15 or 20 days later, when everything indicated that the threat to us was being overcome, an unexpected announcement seemed to me to overturn everything: Savo Zlatic had arrived in Tirana with an extremely important message from the Yugoslav leadership and sought an urgent meeting with us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We received him as soon as possible<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp477">1</A>]</FONT>. As far as I remember Hysni Kapo and I were there from our side and from the Yugoslav side, Zlatic, Krajger, a planning <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>specialist<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> as a sort of secretary of the Co-ordination Commission, and I am not wrong in listing Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo, too, on the Yugoslav side. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Zlatic's uncommonly glowering face and even more the cold and haughty look which he gave me at the moment we met made my heart sing. I understood that Tito had not dared to commit the crazy act of demanding the unification of Albania with Yugoslavia in writing, over his own signature. I was still more convinced that the Yugoslavs were on the downward path when Zlatic produced some papers and began to communicate: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am instructed to present to you the judgments and most recent new proposals of the Yugoslav leadership! Our leadership insists on the fact that the organizational forms of our relations do not respond to the content and essence of the relations created. Practical experience has led us to a combined economic unit and the future difficulties in the construction of socialism will be more easily dealt with, if we put the economic union on sounder foundations. Any step which we take in this direction will make the solution not only of the economic problems, but all other problems, easier.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Zlatic's obvious gloom and ill-humour were immediately reflected on the faces of Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo. Unfor-

tunately for them, the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>emissary<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> from Belgrade had reduced the rank of the demands. From <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>political union<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he had come down to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>economic union<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. Where would it end?! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile, Zlatic continued his presentation of the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>new<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> proposals: we should proceed with an economic plan and maintain common stands towards other countries; we should have a common system on economic, trade and financial questions; we should have the same methodology of planning; common laws; open borders, common passports; the same education system, etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That means we should be like one state!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe suddenly took heart. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Zlatic gave him a savage and angry look and Xoxe immediately hung his head, all fear and embarrassment. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> replied Savo. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That will be a later issue. Our leadership is not pleased with the explanations you demand about the proposal for unification. It seems that you have reservations. Very well, we are no longer repeating the request. The new proposals have to do with something in between. That is, for the time being we will appear as two states, but act as one state.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I turned first to Ko&ccedil;i as if to make things <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>clearer<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to him: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Zlatic is saying that formally we shall be separate states but in essence we shall be one with Yugoslavia. Am I not right, Comrade Zlatic?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What I considered necessary I stated clearly!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied brusquely. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>As for the remainder, hear what I shall continue to communicate. Our leadership thinks that the new step should be concretized in organizational forms with the creation of a committee in Belgrade and a co-ordination commission in Tirana. The committee in Belgrade will be headed by a Yugoslav minister and have an Albanian deputy minister. The co-ordination commission in Tirana will be headed by an Albanian minister and have a Yugoslav deputy minister. Obviously, the main new thing here will be the committee. It will be a joint organ of our two governments which will assume some of the competences and responsibilities of both 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 479</B></FONT><P>

states. Hence, this committee will be the beginning of the future joint government. The co-ordination commission in Tirana will be linked with it. However, while the co-ordination commission will be engaged mostly with questions of the joint economy, the committee will also be engaged with other problems. Now what is needed is that we put all these things that I presented in a joint protocol so that everything will receive the official seal and be in order, also, from the standpoint of international law.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Have you brought a draft of this protocol ?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We shall formulate it here. It will be a simple matter. In it we will present ourselves as two states, but the links and accords which will be attached to it will make the existence of two states a formal question. This is the future, that is to say, the federation!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Everything was clear. The Yugoslavs wanted to trap us, to lead us through the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>protocol<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to that same path on which they had failed by means of their proposal for union. However, their new manoeuvre no longer indicated strength and blackmail. Now it was more like a desperate attempt, a shot in the dark in the vain hope of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>hitting the target<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. It was the moment for us to raise our tone: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Zlatic,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we listened to the new proposals of your leadership and, of course, we shall think about them, discuss them and give you our reply. However, many of the things you said are obscure, even disturbing and excuse me for saying so, not correct on your part.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Please,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>how do you mean concretely?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You want us to take such a step which, in essence, is the union of our two countries, the amalgamation of our two states. You said this yourself. For this you want us to draft a protocol. Twenty days or so ago you presented to us demands which would have the same result for us, except that then it was to be done through a proposal which we should make 'from our side', but on your request. Now I want to ask you: are such actions normal in the relations between sovereign 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 480</B></FONT><P>

states?! We sent Comrade Tito a letter asking him to explain to us how he saw and considered the question of the unification of our two countries. You did not send us a reply.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The proposals which I presented are the reply!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Zlatic, making a slip, perhaps from his mad haste. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If what you say is true, then the problem is extremely grave. You can call it what you like, but we take this as an attempt to face us with an accomplished fact. We have no reason to deceive one another. We sought clarification on 'why we should unite now' and did not seek a protocol in which we would sign the unification.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is not a protocol for unification!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Sergej Krajger intervened. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is a protocol for better regulation of the relations between our countries, especially in the economic field.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You remember the conversation we had three or four months ago on the question of the co-ordination commission,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said to Krajger. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You said this commission would iron out any disagreement and would put everything in order. In any case, the commission was created. Later you came and complained to me that matters were not going well, because our ministries did not report to you on everything you required from them. I told you in a comradely way that I was not in agreement with your requests, but on your insistence I instructed the ministries that they should do this. And what resulted from this?! Our people were kept engaged on useless studies and projects. They were engaged more in compiling reports and information for you than on seeing to the questions of the economy. Now, if we allow the committee to be created in Belgrade, we will all have to turn into reporters and suppliers of information for that committee.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Everything is done for the best,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Krajger replied <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>gently<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and our aims are sincere. You should not deny our aid. You must understand that Yugoslavia is making sacrifices for you and, on the problems of aid, it treats you exactly like its own republics. But while with our republics everything is settled easily, with you, while you remain a separate state, willy-nilly, difficulties and disagreements arise.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 481</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Our orientation and concern<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, I told him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>has been to complete the obligations to and contracts with Yugoslavia, first of all. Indeed, we have accepted such links and organisms which any other state could hardly permit. One of them is the commission which you lead. And if matters are still not going well, don't seek the cause amongst us.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am referring to the fact that disagreements arise because we are separate,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> intervened Krajger. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Your department sees the problems in one way, the Yugoslav department in another way. Each side is concerned with its own interest. Let me give you some examples,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said and made a sign to a third Yugoslav who, like a clockwork toy, quickly produced a piece of paper from his briefcase. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Look what occurs,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said the Yugoslav raising his voice. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Your side makes demands which cannot be fulfilled. Take, for instance, tweezers. You have asked for 70 000 tweezers for a year! This is the limit! You have emptied the Yugoslav market of them!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There may be unreasonable requests!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said to the Yugoslavs, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>but I am unable to answer you about the tool you mention. In what branch of the economy is it used?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Unexpectedly, the tense atmosphere of the meeting relaxed for a moment. The interpreters began to speak with the Yugoslavs to clear up what this tool was. Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe was holding his head in his hands, while Zlatic was making crazy gestures: he was pulling out eyebrows with the tips of his fingers and trying to tell me something. Finally, the mystery was solved. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The interpreter started to explain to me: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The reference is to a piece of springy steel strip bent double which is used by women to pluck their eyebrows.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     It was not the moment to laugh, but to shout at them: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Shame on you that you mention such crazy things!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I exploded at the Yugoslavs. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Our women and girls don't even know the name of the instruments you are talking about and they never think of plucking their eyebrows! They still have insufficient food, they have no clothes for their backs and shoes for their feet, while you complain to us that 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 482</B></FONT><P>

we have allegedly emptied your market of eyebrow pluckers.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp482">1</A>]</FONT> Keep them for yourselves. On my own responsibility I tell you not to bring a single pair to Albania!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You should not be angry. We brought this up as an example of the irregularities which are created. There are many like this,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and the Yugoslav continued to list them: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You have demanded so many tons of boot polish, so many thousand boot nails, so many million (I think about 7-8 million) pen nibs (?!), so many thousand kilograms of beverage essence, etc., etc.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Astonishing! Extremely astonishing!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said indignantly and turned to Pandi Kristo who was cowering in a corner like a shitty rabbit: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Did you order these things? Why do you need them?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Commander, you are quite right, but the Yugoslav comrades are right, too. We don't really need those things, but when we asked for some motors and equipment for the railway, the Yugoslav comrades of the plan suggested to us that we order these, too, because their market was full of them. They told us: 'They are very cheap, order them in the framework of the credit.'<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Surprisingly, even after this the Yugoslavs were not in the least shocked. On the contrary, Zlatic found the way out: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>It is not important who put them in the plan!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he explained. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The important thing is why these irregularities occur. They occur because we still act as two separate states. Everything will be settled if you approve our proposals!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Had you anything else to communicate to us?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Nothing. If you are ready we can begin the drafting of the protocol,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Zlatic made bold to say in his haste. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>And why do you want that protocol?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked, feigning ignorance.

In the book <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yugoslav-Albanian Relations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (1939-1948) published in Belgrade in 1949, Tito's men have not forgotten to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>point out<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> even this fact. On page 205 (edition in the Albanian language), they complain that the Albanian side <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>has sent the Federal Planning Commission of the FPRY a request for 70 000 pairs of tweezers for plucking eyebrows.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 483</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>To be in order in the future!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied there and then. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Some frictions, disagreements might occur. Without a protocol you might say 'we understood it this way' and we might say 'we understood it that way'. While a protocol is a document. We shall refer to it and let the responsibility lie with the proper person.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Look here!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You appreciate the importance of the protocol very correctly and I agree with you. But why do you not consider it correct to give us your opinions, comments and especially your proposals in documents, in writing?! You fired a barrage of them at us in November. I asked you to hand them to us in writing, but to this day you have not done such a thing. You came in December, made a whole lot of proposals, but once again orally. You came in February and March, and the same thing! We are awaiting a reply from Comrade Tito, but it does not come. Now, once again you make new proposals, but again orally. How are we to know that what you say is accurate?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I transmit precisely the instructions of our leadership,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said, looking disconcerted. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You are telling us openly that you do not believe us. Do you not believe me, or do you not believe the leadership of the CPY and Comrade Tito?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This is not the place for such questions!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied sternly in a frigid tone. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are not discussing the content of the problems which you raised, but the way in which they are presented. We shall examine them only when you have given them to us in writing!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     With this the meeting came to an end. As he was leaving, Zlatic was about to say something more, but apparently decided against it. The others followed him out with their heads hanging. I remained alone with Hysni. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Perhaps we'll have a big flare-up with them,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But you put them in their place. Let them consider carefully before they provoke another November. They should know that there comes a time when even our patience and calm come to an end.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 484</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Anything might happen,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>however, for some time I've noticed a surprising fear and confusion in all of them. I don't understand why they are rushing with such obvious chauvinist impatience to achieve the union at all costs. Nevertheless, we must be vigilant. For us everything is now clear. We shall respond to their attack with attack. There is no other way.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

The ignominious end
</B>

<P><BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No more than two or three days after this meeting, an important event finally cleared up and enlightened us on everything: the first letter<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp484">1</A>]</FONT> of the CC of the CPSU addressed to the Yugoslav Titoite leadership reached us. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I read the letter right through without stopping to draw breath, and from the opening paragraphs I felt a joy and satisfaction such as I had rarely experienced in all my life. Calmly, with unshakeable arguments, the CC of the CP of the Soviet Union brought out the major mistakes and distortions in the line of the leadership of the CPY, its unrestrained nationalism and megalomania, and the course full of dangers and harmful consequences on which it was leading the Yugoslav peoples. Although our Party and country and our relations with the leadership of the CPY were not mentioned anywhere in the letter, it seemed to me as if every paragraph took account precisely of the things which had been occurring to us for years on end in connection with the Titoite leadership. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The whole letter was an indirect confirmation, also, of the correctness of the line of the CPA, was a refutation of all the endless criticisms, accusations, slanders and pressures

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 485</B></FONT><P>

which Tito and his <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>emissaries<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> had made against us for 6-7 years on end. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I was finally convinced that our cause was triumphing. Not only would the fierce conflict in which we were engaged with the leaders of Belgrade be resolved correctly, but more important, it would be resolved more quickly and without so many complications, battles and losses as if we were obliged to fight alone. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I summoned Hysni immediately, gave him the letter to read and saw that he, too, was filled with the same emotions, the same feelings as those I had experienced a little earlier. The time had come to breathe freely, the time had come for our Party and people to throw off that evil spirit and heavy burden which had hindered and threatened us for years. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We are proved right! We are going to win. Long live the Party!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Hysni with tears in his eyes, as soon as he finished reading the letter, and he embraced me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>This historic letter of Stalin explains and clears up everything!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Do you remember what we talked about a few days ago?! The Yugoslavs' haste and insistence on signing the unification seemed to us astonishing and incomprehensible. Now it is clear. Through their dirty manoeuvres and pressure they wanted to get the business with us over and done with quickly, because they were uneasy about their conflict with the Soviet comrades. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Have Ko&ccedil;i and Pandi read it?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Hysni asked me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>They are not here. They have gone to the districts to propagate the 8th Plenum! As soon as they return I shall inform them.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us see how they receive the news. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Like a thunderbolt,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Nevertheless, it is still too early to analyse this historic letter in detail. We shall inform the other comrades of the Bureau, let them all read the letter and then we shall meet and discuss it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     That same day or the following day, Kristo Themelko and Beqir Balluku came to me in alarm: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Commander,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> they told me, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>General Kupre- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 486</B></FONT><P>

sanin asked for a meeting with us and communicated very grave accusations to us. He instructed us to transmit them to you and we came immediately!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What is the General displeased about?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>About everything!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> exclaimed Kristo Themelko. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In the first place about the economy. He does not agree with your formulation that 'the Albanian economy is based on its own forces and also relies on the aid of Yugoslavia and the fraternal countries'. Kupresanin calls this a violation of the agreement. He told me that we should not say 'the Albanian economy', but 'the joint Albanian-Yugoslav economic plans'.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, yes!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>encouraged<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Go ahead!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He told us that he is displeased that some time ago a director of a factory in Shkodra was arrested for hostile activity. He is of Yugoslav origin and on this account should not be touched!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Themelko went on to list the other <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Yugoslav General: the third <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> had to do with our foreign policy: the Austrian government had proposed to recognize the People's Republic of Albania and we had allegedly made a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>fatal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> mistake -- we had not protested against this request of Austria! According to Kupresanin, we would have protested and rejected the request because, first, Austria and Yugoslavia were quarrelling with each other over the question of a Slovenian minority and, second, how could Albania be recognized by Austria without the approval of Yugoslavia?! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The fourth <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusation<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> had to do with the housing policy of the Executive Committee of Durr&euml;s: some families of Yugoslav specialists had been shifted into new houses, because the zone of their former houses had been put at the disposal of the army! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He was very annoyed!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> concluded Themelko. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He listed these things one by one and communicated to us that in these conditions we could no longer collaborate in the military field!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>And did you accept the 'accusations'?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We took notes,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Themelko told me. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We were badly 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 487</B></FONT><P>

shocked by what he said about our military relations. If they abandon the collaboration with us we are in trouble! Without their aid, how can we carry out all those plans in the army! So I asked him whether there was anything that displeased him in the army. He told us there was nothing.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, there was, yes there was!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> added Balluku. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Good seats are not reserved for the Yugoslav officers in the football stadium!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Oh, you are right, I forgot!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> remembered Shule. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Some ignorant individual gave our officer friends ordinary seats for a football match. It could have been done deliberately, because the enemy keeps up such things.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Did Kupresanin raise the question of tickets, too?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Yes, he did and he was indignant about it!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> explained Shule. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>And how did the meeting end?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked, controlling my anger with great effort. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Like this! We begged him not to hold it against us, told him that we would correct the mistakes, and came straight to you. It is very disturbing!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Your stand is disturbing and incomprehensible!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said sternly. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>My remarks are addressed first, to you Kristo, as member of the Political Bureau, but also to you, Beqir Balluku, as chief of the General Staff of the army. You had no reason at all to listen to the Yugoslav General as soon as you realized that he was speaking to you about problems which do not pertain to him. However, after your first mistake you fell into the second. Instead of indignantly rejecting the ridiculous 'accusations' he made to you, you accepted them without giving any thought to what you were doing.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Shule and Balluku opened their eyes in astonishment at what they were hearing, but when they saw the indignation and determination with which I was speaking they hung their heads and shrugged their shoulders as if to say, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Even in these situations only oppose the thunderbolts of the friends like this!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Now it was not difficult to understand the meaning of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 488</B></FONT><P>

this new attack of the Yugoslavs! Indeed, rather than an attack this was a plan which came from Belgrade to feel our pulse. In Belgrade they had judged: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let us strike a new blow at the Albanians and see how matters stand. If they reply angrily, then they have been informed by Stalin about what has been going on. If not, then, in the context of new accusations, let us carry the 8th Plenum deeper so that they will be forced to jump quickly into our arms.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> It was not for nothing that on this occasion they activated the General and not the diplomat Zlatic. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I carefully weighed up the dirty provocation which they had made against us and thought that Tito should immediately receive the reply he deserved. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I demanded an urgent meeting of the Political Bureau (meanwhile Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and Pandi Kristo had returned from their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>missions<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>) and we began. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I sought this special meeting of the Bureau,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told the comrades, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>to inform you of two important problems of the past four or five days. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The first and most important problem has to do with a letter of the CC of the CPSU sent to the Yugoslav leadership at the end of March. I shall say nothing about the exceptional importance and value of this letter because you will understand this yourselves as soon as you hear it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     For the first time after so many years of quarrels, debates and, frequently, meaningless rows, a complete, deep silence fell in our Political Bureau. While I was reading I could hear the breathing of the comrades. I knew the impressions and reactions which each paragraph and phrase of the letter aroused were different in the different comrades. Hysni and Gogo listened all serious attention, but I noticed that their faces and eyes were smiling; Bedri and Tuk sat in wide-eyed amazement at what they were hearing. As for Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Pandi Kristo, Kristo Themelko, Nesti Kerenxhi and Xhoxhi BIushi, their heads were hanging and they were gasping for breath as if they were being hit in the ribs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That is the content of the letter,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said to the comrades when I had finished. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Now the next question is: How are we going to act after this? I think it is still too soon to discuss it. Each of us must sit down and study the letter, taking notes, so that we thoroughly understand its essence, and when we met, each of us should speak freely, as his conviction and conscience tells him. In the analyses which we have made we have often suffered from a great evil: the tendency has existed for one comrade or the other to impose on others views and stands with which they are not in agreement. We must put an end to this tendency and I think we should set the example when we analyse this letter. Second, I think we should analyse the letter of the Soviet leadership on a broader plane. It seems to me that we know the leaders of the CPY, their line and stands better than the other communist parties, because we have had contacts, agreements and disagreements with them for years. Therefore, what we say in reply to the letter of the Bolshevik Party we must link with our own experience, with our relations with the Yugoslav leadership. Third,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told the comrades, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I instruct that we must be extremely careful, vigilant and prudent, especially at these moments. We should bear well in mind the fact that the problems which have arisen between the Soviet leadership and the Yugoslav leadership are strictly internal matters, still under discussion between them. It would be an unpardonable sin if anyone of us, on account of the special relations which have been created with the Yugoslav leadership, were to hasten and bring to light outside our Bureau the problems which are raised in this letter. Such an action would bring great harm to us and would also further aggravate and complicate the relations created between the Soviet and the Yugoslav comrades. Applying the norms of relations between sister parties, Stalin sent us this letter for our information, and that is all. Whether or not we express solidarity with this letter, this Stalin does not demand of us, but neither does he deny our right to do so. This will depend on us. But, as I said, we must not pronounce ourselves on this today in a hasty manner. When we are ready, we shall meet. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 490</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>That was the first problem. From this moment, the letter of the Soviet leadership is at the disposal of each comrade of the Bureau and you may come and read it whenever you like and as frequently as you consider reasonable. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>The second problem,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I continued, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>has to do with a grave incident which General Kupresanin provoked two days ago.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     I mentioned in detail all the General's <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>accusations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and pointed out: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Anyone can see that the things Kupresanin raised are ridiculous, without any foundation and completely unjust. As to why the General took this step, this is another problem. To my mind, this was a provocation.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>In what sense?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe hastened to ask. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Mainly in two senses!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied there and then. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>First, perhaps the General made these 'accusations', which I don't believe he himself can consider serious, with the aim of feeling our pulse, to see whether or not we have been informed about the Soviet-Yugoslav conflict. They will measure this from our stand towards the most recent accusations. Second, perhaps they made the 'accusations' with the aim that we should act as we acted with the 'accusations' of Zlatic in November, that is, organize another 8th Plenum and be compelled to accept all those 'proposals' which they have made to us recently. I see no other possibility, and precisely on this account I suspect that the stand of the Yugoslav General is a provocation. If you, Comrade Ko&ccedil;i, see some other motive, tell us so that we make no mistake. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe said nothing more and after waiting a few seconds, I continued: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Regardless of this, it is impermissible far us to fall prey to the provocation, but neither will we be hasty and bring out things which are extremely secret and still under discussion. For this reason I think we should immediately send Comrade Tito a letter in which we explain what Kupresanin said, prove why his 'accusations' are baseless and ask him to explain what impelled the General to take this step.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 491</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
    <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Would it not be better to clear the matter up ourselves with Kupresanin?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> asked Nesti Kerenxhi, Ko&ccedil;i's deputy in the Ministry of the Interior, this time. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>By no means!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>He is simply a military man and there is no reason why we should discuss such problems with him. Indeed, I think we should stress this strongly to Tito in the letter. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>We should write that it does not seem to us correct that a general should come and raise these problems with us, even if they were well-based. We should say to Tito: If your comrades considered these matters important, then your ambassador Josip Djerdja or your 'delegate' Zlatic could come and point them out to us, but never the General. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Likewise, we should write to Tito that it seems to us astonishing that the General threatens us with breaking off collaboration in the military field, simply because good seats were not reserved in the stadium for some Yugoslav officers! We should say, also, that we do not understand why such actions are being taken and, in the end, should repeat that we are for friendly relations in the spirit of the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin. We should stress this, comrades, because for some time a slogan impermissible for us has been introduced. Instead of the spirit of Marxism, some mention 'the spirit of the Economic Convention'. Such a thing is absurd. This is my opinion. Let us discuss it and reach a decision.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I am afraid of one thing!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe threw the stone, although with a weak and trembling voice. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Comrade Tito might link our reply with Stalin's letter and suspect that we have been informed about it.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>What if he does!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Hysni. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Let him suspect! He has no reason to take offence at it. On the contrary, let this impel him to inform us about the Yugoslav views, as Comrade Stalin quite rightly did about the Soviet views. Since he calls us a sister party, indeed the closest one, why should he keep these things hidden from us?!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But Tito might think that we opposed Kupresanin be- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 492</B></FONT><P>

cause Stalin's letter influenced us!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe dared to add. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>You have no reason to think so badly of Comrade Tito!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I replied to Xoxe, goading him in <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>his own terrain<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Tito might have many faults and in my opinion he has plenty of them, but you have no reason to accuse him of a weak memory. This is not the first time we have opposed him. Without going back into past years, just during the past three or four months we have opposed him several times. We refused his demand about the division, refused the proposal about the unified command, refused the demand for the unification of Albania with Yugoslavia, now you have regrets because we are not accepting the stupidities of General Kupresanin! Do you think that we ought to hold another 8th Plenum on the basis of them?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, you misunderstood me,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe submissively. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>I don't mind our writing the letter, but it seemed to me they might suspect we have been influenced by the Soviets. However, now I am convinced, I agree we should send the letter.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The savage Ko&ccedil;i was no longer brandishing the <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sword<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which the 8th Plenum gave him, nor even raising his feathers. To say that he was frightened is putting it mildly. He was experiencing the first agony of the evil deed to which he had committed himself under the pressure and manoeuvres of Belgrade, but also on account of his own unhealthy ambitions and conscience. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     This occurred on April 17, 1948, as I remember very well. I remember this date, because only one day later, April 18, 1948, it became quite clear that the cause of the Yugoslavs, at least in connection with our Party and country, had come to an end. It was more than clear to me that this end would come one day, but that it would come so quickly and in such unexpected, even ludicrous, circumstances, had never crossed my mind. This is what happened: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     At that period, two or three Soviet film-makers had come to our country to make a documentary film about Albania. They had finished their work and before they left 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 493</B></FONT><P>

for Moscow they informed me through the Soviet ambassador that they would be very happy if I would find the time to see the film they had made. I was very pleased to accept. On the evening of April 18, I invited the film-makers to the Palace of Brigades and together with them invited ambassador Chuvakin and the main functionaries of the Soviet embassy as our guests. I also sent an informal invitation to the Yugoslav ambassador and Savo Zlatic, the Bulgarian ambassador and some others that I don't remember. From our comrades, Hysni Kapo, Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe, Bedri Spahiu and Tuk Jakova were present. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     That was simply a social evening quite without protocol. Understandably, we gave the greatest honour to those who provided the occasion for us to get together -- our film-maker guests. Very happy that we were meeting, after we had clinked glasses they got up to prepare the projector to show us the film. Everything was going very well up to this point, we were talking and cracking jokes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Meanwhile, I saw Savo Zlatic stand up scowling, as if the dog had stolen his dinner. He went around the table where Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe was sitting, approached Hysni and seemed about to say something to him, but apparently changed his mind, made a sign to Djerdja and the two came towards me. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Do you want to sit here?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I said to them cheerfully, and made room for them. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Sit down!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>No, we are leaving!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Savo Zlatic. I saw with astonishment that his face and neck were flushed red and he was clenching his jaws. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked him. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Is something wrong?! Are you not feeling well?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Tomorrow afternoon or the day after tomorrow at the most, I am leaving for Belgrade,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> said Zlatic brusquely. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>But before I leave you must arrange for me a meeting with two comrades of your Central Committee to transmit our complaints.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     He was speaking with such tension and anger that it was useless to ask him to explain what was the cause of this sudden outburst. 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 494</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>With whom do you wish to meet?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I asked. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There is no further room for any preference!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he replied savagely and with cynicism. <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>With whoever is there.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Then, we shall appoint Comrade Xoxe,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> I told him, making him snort a little, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>and. . . Comrade Hysni Kapo!<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The Yugoslavs left. I was very surprised at what occurred but, nevertheless, I gave no sign of it. We had met for something else and I did not want to arouse any concern or suspicion in the guests. The only person who did not say a word or raise his head after this was Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe. The gloom of his face was blacker than the darkness that fell when they started to show the film. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      The following day Hysni and Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe met Zlatic and what they transmitted to me was truly shameless. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      According to Zlatic and Djerdja, the social evening which I described above was not a social evening but an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>anti-Yugoslav demonstration<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> (?!), an <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>insult<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which I had allegedly made to Zlatic, the Yugoslav army and all Yugoslavia! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Why?<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> Hysni had asked him in surprise. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Because Enver Hoxha had invited more Soviets than Yugoslavs, at a time when there are more Yugoslavs than Soviets in Albania! Because you had not invited General Kupresanin, had not invited Yugoslav specialists. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      He had blurted out some other tales which are not worthy of mention and had concluded: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
       <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>There can be no further collaboration with you. After this insult General Kupresanin and all the Yugoslav military men no longer have any place in Albania; we shall re-examine the economic agreements, we shall re-examine everything. We are leaving because your friendship with Yugoslavia has no foundation, our relations are worse than in June 1947 (when they made their first accusation), indeed, worse than in November (when they made their second accusation); because Enver Hoxha has always behaved with us in this way and. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      Events automatically turned in a new direction, or more precisely, precipitated at new, more rapid rates. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
      With the departure of the Yugoslav <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>envoys<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and their 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 495</B></FONT><P>

suite of advisers and specialists so suddenly and for so utterly ridiculous reasons, the Yugoslav leadership finally put the seal on an indisputable truth: their hostile and conspiratorial aims and ambitions towards Albania. There is no other way to explain this sudden and ignominious departure. In all that period, we had not given any occasion for any incident or misunderstanding in our relations with them. We had been extremely correct, indeed, we had tolerated and permitted stands and actions which in other situations we would have dismissed with indignation and scorn. At the same time, they had not heard a single word about how we were going to react to the letter of the Bolshevik Party and to the Soviet-Yugoslav conflict as a whole. It was not for nothing that in the meeting of the Political Bureau one day earlier, I did not express my opinion about Stalin's letter and it was not fortuitous that I demanded that the comrades should not pronounce themselves about it there and then. I did this so that the comrades could prepare themselves quietly and freely, but also in the belief that Xoxe and his clan would immediately pass our opinions on to their masters Thus, we did not give them this weapon. Then, why did they clear out? No doubt because they were informed by Xoxe of just one fact: Stalin's letter had come into our hands. For the Yugoslavs this meant that their plot for the gobbling up of Albania had failed. They had been unable to make us yield when we knew nothing about the conflict which they had with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, let alone now when we saw that we were not alone in our efforts. Hence, convinced that they could gain nothing, they found the excuse and cleared out. In their fury and despair that they were unable to achieve their Yugoslavia of 7 republics, they no longer worried their heads about their agents. As Zlatic told me at the last moment, now they no longer had <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>preferences<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. For the plotters of Belgrade, as for the plotters of all times and countries, this was more than normal. They had never liked Ko&ccedil;i Xoxe and the others for the colour of their eyes. They wanted them to serve as their <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>internal<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 496</B></FONT><P>

support for the carrying out of the plot. Since they failed in their purpose, to the devil with the tools! Let them do what they pleased, or what they could! If through trickery they managed to escape our justice, then in suitable situations their patrons would launch them into activity again. If they did not escape, then the Serbian church would light a candle for them, while now that the plot had failed, a heavy sentence on the agents would be convenient to the Titoite propaganda. They would accuse us of <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>violations of democracy<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>, etc., etc. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In order to be just and correct to the end, immediately after the crazy act which Kupresanin and Zlatic committed, we sent Tito another letter in which we expressed our astonishment and indignation about their departure without any cause from our side. Tito replied within two days, naturally, defending the action of his delegates in a few general words, and at the same time, accusing us of causing the tension in relations. And why? Tito listed three causes: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     First, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>you [the Albanians] are lacking in the necessary faith in our opinions about Albania.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp496">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     Second, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we [the Yugoslavs] cannot agree to make material sacrifices, which are not small, in favour of Albania and to the detriment of our people, and despite this not see the improvement of our relations.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     What Tito understood with this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>improvement of relations<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> he expressed openly in the third <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>cause<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>If we truly desire a rapprochement,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> concluded the Marshal, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>then let us re-examine our collaboration. . . and increase it on a basis which responds to the given stage and the international circumstances.<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     As to what this <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>given stage<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> and these <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>international circumstances<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which Tito mentioned in an undertone were, this his delegates had told us unequivocally earlier: <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the stage of federal union<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to emerge in <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>the tense international circumstances<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> as a <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>minor power<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>. After this he did

not fail to repeat the threat that they would cut off aid, re-examine all their relations with us, and he <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advised<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> us to seek the culprits in <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>a part of your leadership<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> which had not agreed with the dictates of the Yugoslavs! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     These orders and <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>advice<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> of the Marshal were extremely threadbare! We had long been acquainted with them, had suffered damage from them, but now they had no effect. We analysed his letter and sent him the reply he deserved. From the outset we told him openly that the leadership of the CPY should seek and find the cause, first of all, in itself, in its impermissible mistakes and stands towards us for years on end. We also pointed out in the letter that the time had come for our Party to look into the matter deeply, with criticism and self-criticism, to find the true causes of the deterioration of relations. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     After pointing out that we had worked sincerely since the years of the war and after it to strengthen our friendship, we stressed that our principal mistake was that <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Our Party and its Central Committee, with great belief and trust in the CPY, have more than once accepted harsh criticisms made verbally by the CC of the CPY against our Party, against its leadership and members of our Party. These things,<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> we wrote, <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>we frequently accepted as indisputable, a thing which is not objective, but on the contrary, is outside the Marxist-Leninist principles and Marxism-Leninism. We admit that we have not acted correctly in this direction. . .<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT><FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     We went on to refute with arguments all the accusations which Tito made against us, one by one, explained why we considered their stands unfair and sinister and. . . we left the ball in their court to manoeuvre as seemed best to them. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     The reply came very quickly, except that this time, since Tito <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>was not<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> in Belgrade, Djilas signed it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     In three lines he told us that our letter did not constitute any basis for discussion and waved a threatening index finger at us:

     What is the explanation for this custom of revisionists?! Do they all copy one another, or does their disease drive them to find the same course? Who can forget the year 1960 and the beginning of 1961 in our battles with Khrushchev and company? Who can forget their insistent demands, after the great breach of November 1960, that we send a delegation<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="TT82iv.html#fnp498">2</A>]</FONT> to Moscow on any condition, in order to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>sign the agreements<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT>?!

     The same thing with the Yugoslavs! Except not in 1960 but in 1948. On both occasions the aim of the revisionists was the same: an urgent summons to <FONT SIZE=-2>&lt;&lt;</FONT>Canossa<FONT SIZE=-2>&gt;&gt;</FONT> to subjugate us! But on both occasions our stand was the same. We told them where they got off. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
     But we are talking about our battles with the first current of modern revisionism in power, the Yugoslav current. That is how everything came to an end in the spring of 1948.
