I should like to make amends to the <I>Piccolo Teatro</I> of Milan and their extraordinary production at the <I>Th&eacute;atre des Nations</I> in July, 1962. Amends for the condemnation and disappointment that Bertolazzi's <I>El Nost Milan</I> drew so copiously from Parisian criticism,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp130">1</A>]</FONT> depriving it of the audiences it deserved. Amends, because, far from diverting our attention from the problems of modern dramaturgy with tired, anachronistic entertainment, Strehler's choice and his production take us to the heart of these problems.

Readers will forgive me if I give a brief summary of the plot of Bertolazzi's play, so that what follows can be understood.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp">2</A>]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The first of its three acts is set in the Milan Tivoli in the 1890s: a cheap, poverty-stricken fun-fair in the thick fog of an autumn evening. With this fog we already find ourselves in an Italy unlike the Italy of our myths. And the people strolling at day's end from booth to booth, between the fortune-tellers, the circus and all the attractions of the fairground: unemployed, artisans, semi-beggars, girls on the look-out, old men and women on the watch for the odd halfpenny, soldiers on a spree, pickpockets chased by the cops . . . neither are these people the people of our myths, they are a sub-proletariat passing the time as best they can before supper (not for all of them) and rest. A good thirty characters who come and go in this empty space, waiting for who knows what, for something to happen, the show perhaps? -- no, for they stop at the

2. Bertolazzi was a late-nineteenth-century Milanese playwright who achieved no more than moderate success -- no doubt because of his obstinate persistence in '<I>verismo </I>' of a style odd enough to displease the public which then set 'theatrical taste': the bourgeois public.

doorway, waiting for something of some sort to happen in their lives, in which nothing happens. They wait. However, at the end of the act, in a flash a 'story' is sketched out, the image of a destiny. A girl, Nina, stands transfixed by the lights of the circus, staring with all her heart through a rent in the canvas at the clown performing his perilous act. Night has fallen. For one moment, time is in suspense. But she is already being watched by the Togasso, the good-for-nothing who hopes to seduce her. A quick defiance, retreat, departure. Now an old man appears, the 'fire-eater', her father, and he has seen everything. Something has taken shape, which might turn into a tragedy. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   A tragedy? It is completely forgotten in the second act. It is broad day in the spacious premises of a cheap eating-house. Here again we find a whole crowd of poor people, the same people but different characters: the same poverty and unemployment, the flotsam of the past, the tragedies and comedies of the present: small craftsmen, beggars, a cabman, a Garibaldian veteran, some women, etc. Also a few workers who are building a factory, in sharp contrast with their lumpen-proletarian surroundings: they are already discussing industry, politics, and, almost, the future, but only just and with difficulty. This is Milan from below, twenty years after the conquest of Rome and the deeds of the Risorgimento: King and Pope are on their thrones, the masses are in poverty. Yes, the day of the second act is indeed the truth of the night of the first: these people have no more history in their lives than they had in their dreams. They survive, that is all: they eat (only the workers depart, called by the factory hooter), they eat and wait. A life in which nothing happens. Then, just at the end of the act, Nina reappears on the stage, for no apparent reason, and with her the tragedy. We learn that the clown is dead. The men and women leave the stage little by little. The Togasso appears, he forces the girl to kiss him and give him what little money she has. Hardly more than a few gestures. Her father arrives. (Nina is weeping at the end of the long table.) He does not eat: he drinks. After a terrible struggle he succeeds in killing the Togasso with a knife and then flees, haggard, overwhelmed by what he has done. Once again a lightning flash after a long grind. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In the third act it is dawn in the women's night shelter. Old women, blending into the walls, sitting down, talk or stay silent. 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 133</B></FONT><P>

One stout peasant woman, bursting with health, will certainly return to the country. Some women pass; as always, we do not know them. The lady warden leads her whole company to Mass when the bells ring. When the stage has emptied, the tragedy begins again. Nina was sleeping in the shelter. Her father comes to see her for the last time before prison: she must realize at least that he killed for her sake, for her honour . . . but suddenly everything is reversed: Nina turns on her father, on the illusions and lies he has fed her, on the myths which will kill him. But not her; for she is going to rescue herself, all alone, for that is the only way. She will leave this world of night and poverty and enter the other one, where pleasure and money reign. The Togasso was right. She will pay the price, she will sell herself, but she will be on the other side, on the side of freedom and truth. The hooters sound. Her father has embraced her and departed, a broken man. The hooters still sound. Erect, Nina goes out into the day light.

There are the themes of this play and the order in which they appear, pressed into a few words. Altogether not much. Enough, however, to foster misunderstandings, but also enough to clear them up, and discover beneath them an astonishing depth. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The first of these misunderstandings is, of course, the accusation that the play is a '<I>m&eacute;lodrame mis&eacute;rabiliste </I>'. But anyone who has 'lived' the performance or studied its economy can demolish this charge. For if it does contain melodramatic elements, as a whole, the drama is simply a criticism of them. Nina's father does indeed live his daughter's story in the melodramatic mode, and not just his daughter's adventure, but above all his own life in his relations with his daughter. He has invented for her the fiction of an imaginary condition, and encouraged her in her romantic illusions; he tries desperately to give flesh and blood to the illusions he has fostered in his daughter: as he wishes to keep her free from all contact with the world he has hidden from her, and as, desperate that she will not listen to him, he kills the source of Evil, the Togasso. So he lives intensively and really the myths he has constructed to spare his daughter from the law of this world. So the father is the very image of melodrama, of the 'law of the heart' 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 134</B></FONT><P>

deluding itself as to the 'law of the world'. It is precisely this deliberate unconsciousness that Nina rejects. She makes her own real trial of the world. With the clown's death her adolescent dreams have died too. The Togasso has opened her eyes and dispatched her childhood myths along with her father's. His violence itself has freed her from words and duties. She has at last seen this naked, cruel world where morality is nothing but a lie; she has realized that her safety lies in her own hands and that she can only reach the other world by selling the only goods at her disposal: her young body. The great confrontation at the end of the third act is more than a confrontation between Nina and her father, it is the confrontation of a world without illusions with the wretched illusions of the 'heart', it is the confrontation of the real world with the melodramatic world, the dramatic access to consciousness that destroys the myths of melodrama, the very myths that Bertolazzi and Strehler are charged with. Those who make this charge could quite easily have found in the play the criticism they tried to address to it from the stalls. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But there is another, deeper reason that should clear up this misunderstanding. I was trying to hint at it in my summary of the play's 'sequence', when I pointed out its strange 'temporal' rhythm. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   For this is, indeed, a play remarkable for its internal dissociation. The reader will have noted that its three acts have the same structure, and almost the same content: the coexistence of a long, slowly-passing, empty time and a lightning-short, full time; the coexistence of a space populated by a crowd of characters whose mutual relations are accidental or episodic -- and a short space, gripped in mortal combat, inhabited by three characters: the father, the daughter and the Togasso. In other words, this is a play in which about forty characters appear, but the tragedy concerns only three of them. Moreover, there is no explicit relationship between these two times or between these two spaces. The characters of the time seem strangers to the characters of the lightning: they regularly give place to them (as if the thunder of the storm had chased them from the stage), only to return in the next act, in other guises, once the instant foreign to their rhythm has passed. If we deepen the latent meaning of this dissociation it will lead us to the heart of the play. For the spectator actually 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 135</B></FONT><P>

lives this deepening as he moves from disconcerted reserve to astonishment and then passionate involvement between the first and the third acts. My aim here is merely to reflect this lived deepening, to make explicit this latent meaning which affects the spectator despite himself. But the decisive question is this: why is it that this dissociation is so expressive, and what does it express? What is this absence of relations to suggest a latent relation as its basis and justification? How can there coexist two forms of temporality, apparently foreign to one another and yet united by a lived relationship? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The answer lies in a paradox: the true relationship is constituted precisely by the absence of relations. The play's success in illustrating this absence of relations and bringing it to life gives it its originality. In short, I do not think we are dealing with a melodramatic veneer on a chronicle of Milanese popular life in 1890. We are dealing with a melodramatic consciousness criticized by an existence: the existence of the Milanese sub-proletariat in 1890. Without this existence it would be impossible to tell what the melodramatic consciousness was; without this critique of the melodramatic consciousness it would be impossible to grasp the tragedy latent in the existence of the Milanese sub-proletariat: its powerlessness. What is the significance of the chronicle of wretched existence that makes up the essential part of the three acts? Why is this chronicle's time a march-past of purely typed, anonymous and interchangeable beings? Why is this time of vague meetings, brief exchanges and broached disputes precisely an empty time? In its progress from the first act through the second to the third, why does this time tend towards silence and immobility? (In the first act there is still a semblance of life and movement on the stage; in the second, everyone is sitting down and some are already lapsing into silence; in the third, the old women blend into the walls.) Why -- if not to suggest the actual content of this wretched time: it is a time in which nothing happens, a time without hope or future, a time in which even the past is fixed in repetition (the Garibaldian veteran) and the future is hardly groped for in the political stammerings of the labourers building the factory, a time in which gestures have no continuation or effect, in which everything is summed up in a few exchanges close to life, to 'everyday life', in discussions and disputes which are either abortive or reduced to nothingness by a 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 136</B></FONT><P>

consciousness of their futility.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp136">3</A>]</FONT> In a word, a stationary time in which nothing resembling History can yet happen, an empty time, accepted as empty: the time of their situation itself. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I know of nothing so masterly in this respect as the setting for the second act, because it gives us precisely <I>a direct perception of this time.</I> In the first act it was still possible to wonder whether the waste land of the Tivoli only harmonized with the nonchalance of the unemployed and idlers who saunter between the few illusions and few fascinating lights at the end of the day. In the second act it is overwhelmingly obvious that the empty, closed cube of this cheap restaurant is an image of time in these men's situation. At the bottom of the worn surface of an immense wall, and almost at the limit of an inaccessible ceiling covered with notices of regulations half effaced by the years but still legible, we see two enormously long tables, parallel to the footlights, one downstage, the other mid-stage; behind them, up against the wall, a horizontal iron bar dividing off the entrance to the restaurant. This is the way the men and women will come in. Far right, a high partition perpendicular to the line of the tables separates the hall from the kitchens. Two hatches, one for alcohol, the other for food. Behind the screen, the kitchens, steaming pots, and the imperturbable cook. The bareness of this immense field created by the parallel tables against the interminable background of the wall, constitutes an unbearably austere and yawning location. A few men are seated at the tables. Here and there. Facing the audience, or with their backs to them. They will talk face on or backwards, just as they are sitting. In a space which is too large for them, a space they will never be able to fill. Here they will make their derisory exchanges, but however often they leave their places in an attempt to join some chance neighbour, who has tossed them a proposal across tables and benches, they will never abolish tables or benches, which will always cut them off from each other, under the inalterable, silent regulation that dominates them. This space is really the time they live in. One man here, another there. Strehler has scattered them around. They will stay where they are. Eating, pausing in their

3. There is a whole tacit conspiracy among these poor folk to separate quarrellers, to circumvent unbearable pains, such as those of the unemployed young couple, to reduce all the troubles and disturbances of this life to it's truth: to silence, immobility and nothingness. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 137</B></FONT><P>

meal, eating again. At these times, the gestures themselves reveal all their meaning. The character seen face-on at the beginning of the scene, his head hardly higher than the plate he would prefer to carry between his two hands. The time it takes him to fill his spoon, to lift it up to his mouth and over it, in an interminable movement designed to ensure that not one scrap is lost, and when at last he has filled his mouth, he lingers over his portion weighing it up before swallowing it. Then we see that the others with their backs to us are making the same movements: their raised elbows compensating for their unstable backs -- we see them eating, absently, like all the other absent people, making the same holy movements in Milan and in all the world's great cities, because that is the whole of their lives, and there is nothing which would make it possible for them to live out their time otherwise. (The only ones with an air of haste are the labourers, their life and work punctuated by the hooters.) I can think of no comparable representation in spatial structure, in the distribution of men and places, of the deep relations between men and the time they live. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Now for the essential point: this temporal structure -- that of the 'chronicle' -- is opposed to another temporal structure: that of the 'tragedy'. For the tragedy's time (Nina) is full: a few lightning-flashes, an articulated time, a 'dramatic' time. A time in which some history must take place. A time moved from within by an irresistible force, producing its own content. It is a dialectical time <I>par excellence.</I> A time that abolishes the other time and the structure of its spatial representation. When the men have left the restaurant, and only Nina, her father and the Togasso are left, something has suddenly disappeared: as if the diners had taken the whole <I>d&eacute;cor</I> with them (Strehler's stroke of genius: to have made two acts one, and played two different acts <I>in the same d&eacute;cor </I>), the very space of walls and tables, the logic and meaning of these locations; as if conflict alone substituted for this visible and empty space another dense, invisible, irreversible space, with one dimension, the dimension that propels it towards tragedy, ultimately, the dimension that had to propel it into tragedy if there was really to be any tragedy. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is precisely this opposition that gives Bertolazzi's play its depth. On the one hand, a non-dialectical time in which nothing happens, a time with no internal necessity forcing it into action; 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 138</B></FONT><P>

on the other, a dialectical time (that of conflict) induced by its internal contradiction to produce its development and result. The paradox of <I>El Nost Milan</I> is that the dialectic in it is acted marginally, so to speak, in the wings, somewhere in one corner of the stage and at the ends of the acts: this dialectic (although it does seem to be indispensable to any theatrical work) is a long time coming: the characters could not care less about it. It takes its time, and never arrives until the end, initially at night, when the air is heavy with the renowned night-owls, then as midday strikes, with the sun already on its descent, finally as dawn rises. This dialectic always appears after everyone has departed. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   How is the 'delay' of this dialectic to be understood? Is it delayed in the way consciousness is for Marx and Hegel? But can a dialectic be delayed? Only on condition that it is another name for consciousness.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   If the dialectic of <I>El Nost Milan</I> is acted in the wings, in one corner of the stage, it is because it is nothing but the dialectic of a consciousness: the dialectic of Nina's father and his consciousness. And that is why its destruction is the precondition for any real dialectic. Here we should recall Marx's analyses in <I>The Holy Family</I> of Eugene Sue's personages.<FONT SIZE=-2>[4]</FONT> The motor of their dramatic 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
4. Marx's book (<I>The Holy Family</I>, English translation, Moscow, 1956) contains no explicit definition of melodrama. But it does tell us its genesis, with Sue as its eloquent witness. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   (<I>a </I>) The <I>Myst&egrave;res de Paris</I> present morality and religion as a veneer on 'natural' beings ('natural' despite their poverty or disgrace). What efforts have gone into this veneer! It needed Rodolphe's cynicism, the priest's moral blackmail, the paraphernalia of police, prison, internment, etc. Finally 'nature' gives in: a foreign consciousness will henceforth govern it (and catastrophes multiply to guarantee its salvation).

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   (<I>b </I>) The origin of this 'veneer' is obvious: it is Rodolphe who imposes this borrowed consciousness on these 'innocents'. Rodolphe neither comes from the 'people', nor is he 'innocent'. But (naturally) he wants to 'save' the people, to teach them that they have souls, that God exists, etc.  -- in other words, whether they will or no he gives them bourgeois morality to parrot so as to keep them quiet.

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   (<I>c </I>) It can be inferred (cf. <I>The Holy Family</I>, p. 242; 'Eug&egrave;ne Sue's personages . . . must express as the result of their own thoughts the conscious motive of their acts, the reason why the writer makes them behave in a certain way and no other') that Sue's novel is the admission of his own project: to give the 'people' a literary myth which will be both the propadeutic for the consciousness they must have, and the consciousness they must have to [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 139. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] be the people (i.e. 'saved', i.e. subordinate, paralysed and drugged, in a word moral and religious). It could not be more bluntly put that it was the bourgeoisie itself that invented for the people the popular myth of the melodrama, that proposed or imposed it (serials in the popular Press, cheap 'novels') just as it was the bourgeoisie that 'gave' them night-shelters, soup kitchens, etc.: in short, a fairly deliberate system of preventive charities. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   (<I>d </I>) All the same, it is entertaining to witness the majority of established critics pretending to be disgusted by melodrama! As if in them the bourgeoisie had <I>forgotten</I> that melodrama was its own invention! But, in all honesty, we must admit that the invention dated quickly: the myths and charities handed out to the 'people' are otherwise organized today, and more ingeniously. We must also accept that at heart it was an invention for others, and it is certainly very disconcerting to see your own works sitting squarely at your right hand for all to see -- or parading unashamedly on your own stages! Is it conceivable, for example, that the romantic Press (the popular 'myth' of recent times) should be invited to the spiritual concert of ruling ideas? We must not mix ranks.

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   (<I>e </I>) It is also true that one can allow oneself what one would forbid others (it used to be what marked out the 'great' in their own consciousness): an exchange of roles. A Person of Quality can use the back stairs for fun (borrow from the people what he has given it, or left over for it). Everything depends on the double-meaning of this surreptitious exchange, on the short terms of the loan, and on its conditions: in other words, on the irony of the game in which one proves to oneself (so this proof is necessary?) that one is not to be fooled by anything, not even by the means that one is using to fool others. In other words one is quite prepared to borrow from the 'people' the myths, the trash that one has fabricated and handed out (or sold) to them, on condition that they are suitably accommodated and 'treated'. Good or mediocre 'treaters' (such as Bruant and Piaf, and the Fr&egrave;res Jacques, respectively) may arise from their ranks. One makes oneself 'one of the people' through a delight in being above one's own methods; that is why it is essential to play at being (not being) the people that one forces the people to be, the people of popular 'myth', people with a flavour of melodrama This melodrama is not worthy of the stage (the real, theatrical stage) It is savoured in small sips in the cabaret. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   (<I>f </I>) My conclusion is that neither amnesia, nor disgust, nor irony produce even the shadow of a critique. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 139</B></FONT><P>

conduct is their identification with the myths of bourgeois morality: these unfortunates live their misery within the arguments of a religious and moral conscience; in borrowed finery. In it they disguise their problems and even their condition. In this sense, melodrama is a foreign consciousness as a veneer on a real condition. The dialectic of the melodramatic consciousness is only possible at this price: this consciousness must be borrowed from 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 140</B></FONT><P>

outside (from the world of alibis, sublimations and lies of bourgeois morality), and it must still be lived as the consciousness of a condition (that of the poor) even though this condition is radically foreign to the consciousness. It follows that between the melodramatic consciousness on the one hand, and the existence of the characters of the melodrama on the other, there can exist no <I>contradiction</I> strictly speaking. The melodramatic consciousness is not contradictory to these conditions: it is a quite different consciousness, imposed from without on a determinate condition but without any dialectical relation to it. That is why the melodramatic consciousness can only be dialectical if it ignores its real conditions and barricades itself inside its myth. Sheltered from the world, it unleashes all the fantastic form of a breathless conflict which can only ever find peace in the catastrophe of someone else's fall: it takes this hullabaloo for destiny and its breathlessness for the dialectic. In it, the dialectic turns in a void, since it is only the dialectic of the void, cut off from the real world for ever. This foreign consciousness, without contradicting its conditions, can not emerge from itself by itself, by its own 'dialectic'. It has to make a rupture -- and recognize this nothingness, discover the non-dialecticity of this dialectic. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This never happens with Sue: but it does in <I>El Nost Milan.</I> In the end the last scene does give an answer to the paradox of the play and of its structure. When Nina turns on her father, when she sends him back into the night with his dreams, she is breaking both with her father's melodramatic consciousness and with his 'dialectic'. She has finished with these myths and the conflicts they unleash. Father, consciousness, dialectic, she throws them all overboard and crosses the threshold of the other world, as if to show that it is in this poor world that things are happening, that everything has already begun, not only its poverty, but also the derisory illusions of its consciousness. This dialectic which only comes into its own at the extremities of the stage, in the aisles of a story it never succeeds in invading or dominating, is a very exact image for the quasi-null relation of a false consciousness to a real situation. The sanction of the necessary rupture imposed by real experience, foreign to the content of consciousness, is to chase this dialectic from the stage. When Nina goes through the door separating her from the daylight she does not yet know what her life 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 141</B></FONT><P>

will be; she might even lose it. At least we know that she goes out into the real world, which is undoubtedly the world of money, but also the world that produces poverty and imposes on poverty even its consciousness of 'tragedy'. And this is what Marx said when he rejected the false dialectic of consciousness, even of popular consciousness, in favour of experience and study of the other world, the world of Capital. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   At this point someone will want to stop me, arguing that what I am drawing from the play goes beyond the intentions of the author -- and that I am, in fact, attributing to Bertolazzi what really belongs to Strehler. But I regard this statement as meaningless, for at issue here is the play's latent structure and nothing else, Bertolazzi's explicit intentions are unimportant: what counts beyond the words, the characters and the action of the play, is the internal relation of the basic elements of its structure. I would go further. It does not matter whether Bertolazzi consciously wished for this structure, or unconsciously produced it: it constitutes the essence of his work; it alone makes both Strehler's interpretation and the audience's reaction comprehensible. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Strehler was acutely aware of the implications of this remarkable structure,<FONT SIZE=-2>[5]</FONT> and his production and direction of the actors were determined by it; that is why the audience was bowled over by it. The spectators' emotion cannot be explained merely by the 'presence' of this teeming popular life -- nor by the poverty of these people, who still manage to keep up a hand-to-mouth existence, accepting their fate, taking their revenge, on occasion with a laugh, at moments by solidarity, most often by silence -- nor by the lightning tragedy of Nina, her father and the Togasso; but basically by their unconscious perception of this structure and its profound meaning. The structure is nowhere exposed, nowhere does it constitute

5. 'The principal feature of the work is precisely the sudden appearances in it of a truth as yet hardly defined . . . <I>El Nost Milan</I> is a drama <I>sotto voce</I>, a drama continually referred back, reconsidered, a drama which is focused from time to time only to be deferred once again, a drama which is made up of a long grey line broken by the cracks of a whip. This is no doubt the reason why Nina and her Father's few decisive cries stand out in particularly tragic relief. . . . We have decided to make some rearrangements in the construction of the play so as to stress this secret structure. Bertolazzi's four acts have been reduced to three by the fusion of the second and third acts. . . .' (Programme Notes)

the object of a speech or a dialogue. Nowhere can it be perceived directly in the play as can the visible characters or the course of the action. But it is there, in the tacit relation between the people's time and the time of the tragedy, in their mutual imbalance, in their incessant 'interference' and finally in their true and delusive criticism. It is this revealing latent relation, this apparently insignificant and yet decisive tension that Strehler's production enables the audience to perceive without their being able to translate this presence directly into clearly conscious terms. Yes, the audience applauded in the play something that was beyond them, which may even have been beyond its author, but which Strehler provided him: a meaning buried deeper than words and gestures, deeper than the immediate fate of the characters who live this fate without ever being able to reflect on it. Even Nina, who is for us the rupture and the beginning, and the promise of another world and another consciousness, does not know what she is doing. Here we can truly say that consciousness is delayed -- for even if it is still blind, it is a consciousness aiming at last at a real world.

If this reflection on an 'experience' is acceptable, we might use it to illuminate other experiences by an investigation into their meaning. I am thinking of the problems posed by Brecht's great plays, problems which recourse to such concepts as the alienation effect or the epic theatre has perhaps not in principle perfectly solved. I am very struck by the fact that a latent asymmetrical critical structure, the dialectic-in-the-wings structure found in Bertolazzi's play, is in essentials also the structure of plays such as <I>Mother Courage</I> and (above all) <I>Galileo.</I> Here again we also find forms of temporality that do not achieve any mutual integration, which have no relation to one another, which coexist and interconnect, but never meet each other, so to speak; with lived elements which interlace in a dialectic which is localized, separate and apparently ungrounded; works marked by an internal dissociation, an unresolved alterity. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The dynamic of this specific latent structure, and in particular, the coexistence without any explicit relation of a dialectical temporality and a non-dialectical temporality, is the basis for a true critique of the illusions of consciousness (which always believes 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 143</B></FONT><P>

itself to be dialectical and treats itself as dialectical), the basis for a true critique of the false dialectic (conflict, tragedy, etc.) by the disconcerting reality which is its basis and which is waiting for recognition. Thus, the war in <I>Mother Courage</I>, as opposed to the personal tragedies of her blindness, to the false urgency of her greed; thus, in <I>Galileo</I> the history that is slower than consciousness impatient for truth, the history which is also disconcerting for a consciousness which is never able to 'take' durably on to it within the period of its short life. This silent confrontation of a consciousness (living its own situation in the dialectical-tragic mode, and believing the whole world to be moved by its impulse) with a reality which is indifferent and strange to this so-called dialectic  an apparently undialectical reality, makes possible an immanent critique of the illusions of consciousness. It hardly matters whether these things are said or not (they are in Brecht, in the form of fables or songs): in the last resort it is not the words that produce this critique, but the internal balances and imbalances of forces between the elements of the play's structure. For there is no true critique which is not immanent and already real and material before it is conscious. I wonder whether this asymmetrical, decentred structure should not be regarded as essential to any theatrical effort of a materialist character. If we carry our analysis of this condition a little further we can easily find in it Marx's fundamental principle that it is impossible for any form of ideological consciousness to contain in itself, through its own internal dialectic, an escape from itself, that, <I>strictly speaking</I>, <I>there is no dialectic of consciousness </I>: no dialectic of consciousness which could reach reality itself by virtue of its own contradictions; in short, there can be no 'phenomenology' in the Hegelian sense: for consciousness does not accede to the real through its own internal development, but by the radical discovery of what is <I>other than itself.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It was in precisely this sense that Brecht overthrew the problematic of the classical theatre -- when he renounced the thematization of the meaning and implications of a play in the form of a consciousness of self. By this I mean that, to produce a new, true and active consciousness in his spectators, Brecht's world must necessarily exclude any pretensions to exhaustive self-recovery and self-representation in the form of a consciousness of self. The classical theatre (though Shakespeare and Moli&egrave;re must be excepted, and 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 144</B></FONT><P>

this exception explained) gave us tragedy, its conditions and its 'dialectic', completely reflected in the speculative consciousness of a central character -- in short, reflected its total meaning in a consciousness, in a talking, acting, thinking, developing human being: what tragedy is for us. And it is probably no accident that this formal condition of 'classical' aesthetics (the central unity of a dramatic consciousness, controlling the other, more famous 'unities') is closely related to its material content. I mean that the material, or the themes, of the classical theatre (politics, morality, religion, honour, 'glory', 'passion', etc.) are precisely ideological themes, and they remain so, without their ideological nature ever being questioned, that is, criticized ('passion' itself, opposed to 'duty' or 'glory' is no more than an ideological counterpoint  never the effective dissolution of the ideology). But what, concretely, is this uncriticized ideology if not simply the 'familiar', 'well known', transparent myths in which a society or an age can recognize itself (but not know itself), the mirror it looks into for self-recognition, precisely the mirror it must break if it is to know itself? What is the ideology of a society or a period if it is not that society's or period's consciousness of itself, that is, an immediate material which spontaneously implies, looks for and naturally finds its forms in the image of a consciousness of self living the totality of its world in the transparency of its own myths? I am not asking why these myths (the ideology as such) were not <I>generally</I> questioned in the classical period. I am content to be able to infer that a time without real self-criticism (with neither the means nor the need for a real theory of politics, morality and religion) should be inclined to represent itself and recognize itself in an uncritical theatre, that is, a theatre whose (ideological) material presupposed the formal conditions for an aesthetic of the consciousness of self. Now Brecht can only break with these formal conditions because he has already broken with their material conditions. His principal aim is to produce a critique of the spontaneous ideology in which men live. That is why he is inevitably forced to exclude from his plays this formal condition of the ideology's aesthetics, the consciousness of self (and its classical derivations: the rules of unity). For him (I am still discussing the 'great plays'), no character consciously contains in himself the totality of the tragedy's conditions. For him, the total, transparent 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 145</B></FONT><P>

consciousness of self, the mirror of the whole drama is never anything but an image of the ideological consciousness, which does include the whole world in its own tragedy, save only that this world is merely the world of morals, politics and religion, in short, of myths and drugs. In this sense these plays are decentred precisely because they can have no centre, because, although the illusion-wrapped, na&iuml;ve consciousness is his starting-point, Brecht refuses to make it that centre of the world it would like to be. That is why in these plays the centre is always to one side, if I may put it that way, and in so far as we are considering a demystification of the consciousness of self, the centre is always deferred, always in the beyond, in the movement going beyond illusion towards the real. For this basic reason the critical relation, which is a real production, cannot be thematized for itself: that is why no character is in himself 'the morality of history' -- except when one of them comes down to the footlights, takes off his mask and, the play over, 'draws the lessons' (but then he is only a spectator reflecting on it from the outside, or rather prolonging its movement: 'we have done our best, now it is up to you'). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It should now be clear why we have to speak of the dynamic of the play's latent structure. It is the structure that we must discuss in so far as the play cannot be reduced to its actors, nor to their explicit relations -- only to the dynamic relation existing between consciousnesses of self alienated in spontaneous ideology (Mother Courage>, her sons, the cook, the priest, etc.) and the real conditions of their existence (war, society). This relation, abstract in itself (abstract with respect to the consciousness of self -- for this abstract is the true concrete) can only be acted and represented as characters, their gestures and their acts, and their 'history' only as a relation which goes beyond them while implying them; that is, as a relation setting to work abstract structural elements (e.g. the different forms of temporality in <I>El Nost Milan</I> -- the exteriority of dramatic crowds, etc.), their imbalance and hence their dynamic. This relation is necessarily latent in so far as it cannot be exhaustively thematized by any 'character' without ruining the whole critical project: that is why, even if it is implied by the action as a whole, by the existence and movements of all the characters, it is their deep meaning, beyond their consciousness -- and thus hidden from them; visible to the spectator in so 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 146</B></FONT><P>

far as it is invisible to the actors -- and therefore visible to the spectator in the mode of a perception which is not given, but has to be discerned, conquered and drawn from the shadow which initially envelops it, and yet produced it. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Perhaps these remarks give us a more precise idea of the problem posed by the Brechtian theory of the alienation-effect. By means of this effect Brecht hoped to create a new relation between the audience and the play performed: a critical and active relation. He wanted to break with the classical forms of identification, where the audience hangs on the destiny of the 'hero' and all its emotional energy is concentrated on theatrical catharsis. He wanted to set the spectator at a distance from the performance, but in such a situation that he would be incapable of flight or simple enjoyment. In short, he wanted to make the spectator into an actor who would complete the unfinished play, but in real life. This profound thesis of Brecht's has perhaps been too often interpreted solely as a function of the technical elements of alienation: the abolition of all 'impressiveness' in the acting, of all lyricism and all 'pathos': <I>al fresco</I> acting; the austerity of the set, as if to eliminate any eye-catching relief (cf. the dark ochre and ash colours in <I>Mother Courage </I>); the 'flat' lighting; the commentary-placards to direct the readers' attention to the external context of the conjuncture (reality), etc. The thesis has also given rise to psychological interpretations centred around the phenomenon of identification and its classical prop: the hero. The disappearance of the hero (whether positive or negative), the object of identification, has been seen as the very precondition of the alienation-effect (no more hero, no more identification -- the suppression of the hero being also linked to Brecht's 'materialist' conception -- it is the masses who make history, not 'heroes'). Now, I feel that these interpretations are limited to notions which may well be important, but which are not determinant, and that it is essential to go beyond the technical and psychological conditions to an understanding that this very special critique must be constituted in the spectator's consciousness. In other words, if a distance can be established between the spectator and the play, it is essential that in some way this distance should be produced within the play itself, and not only in its (technical) treatment, or in the psychological modality of the characters (are they really heroes or non- 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 147</B></FONT><P>

heroes? Take the dumb daughter on the roof in <I>Mother Courage</I>, shot because she beat her infernal drum to warn the unknowing city that an enemy was about to fall on it, is she not, in fact, a 'positive hero'? Surely we do temporarily 'identify' with this secondary character?). It is within the play itself, in the dynamic of its internal structure, that this distance is produced and represented, at once criticizing the illusions of consciousness and unravelling its real conditions. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This -- that the dynamic of the latent structure produces this distance within the play itself -- must be the starting-point from which to pose the problem of the relation between the spectator and the performance. Here again Brecht reverses the established order. In the classical theatre it was apparently quite simple: the hero's temporality was the sole temporality, all the rest was subordinate to it, even his opponents were made to his measure, they had to be if they were to be <I>his</I> opponents; they lived <I>his</I> time, <I>his</I> rhythm, they were dependent on him, they were merely his dependants. The opponent was really <I>his</I> opponent: in the struggle the hero belonged to the opponent as much as the opponent did to the hero, the opponent was the hero's double, his reflection, his opposite, his night, his temptation, his own unconscious turned against him. Hegel was right, his destiny was consciousness of himself as of an enemy. Thereby the content of the struggle was identified with the hero's consciousness of himself. And quite naturally, the spectator seemed to 'live' the play by 'identifying' himself with the hero, that is, with his time, with his consciousness, the only time and the only consciousness offered him. In Bertolazzi's play and in Brecht's great plays this confusion becomes impossible, precisely because of their dissociated structure. I should say, not that the heroes have disappeared because Brecht has banished them from his plays, but that even as the heroes they are, and in the play itself, the play makes them impossible, abolishes them, their consciousness and its false dialectic. This reduction is not the effect of the action alone, nor of the demonstration which certain popular figures are fated to make of it (on the theme: neither God nor Caesar); it is not even merely the result of the play appreciated as an unresolved story, it is not produced at the level of detail or of continuity, but at the deeper level of the play's structural dynamic. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 148</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   At this point dose attention is essential: up till now only tho play has been discussed -- now we must deal with the spectator's consciousness. I should like to show in a few words that this is not, as might have been thought, a new problem, but really the same one. However, if this is to be accepted, two classical models of the spectatorial consciousness which cloud our reflection must first of all be relinquished. The first of these misleading models is once again a consciousness of self, this time the spectator's. It accepts that the spectator should not identify with the 'hero'; he is to be kept at a distance. But is he not then outside the play judging, adding up the score and drawing the conclusions? Mother Courage is presented to you. It is for her to act. It is for you to judge. On the stage the image of blindness -- in the stalls the image of lucidity, led to consciousness by two hours of unconsciousness. But this division of roles amounts to conceding to the house what has been rigorously excluded from the stage. Really, the spectator has no claim to this absolute consciousness of self which the play cannot tolerate. The play can no more contain the 'Last Judgement' on its own 'story' than can the spectator be the supreme Judge of the play. He also sees and lives the play in the mode of a questioned false consciousness. For what else is he if not the brother of the characters, caught in the spontaneous myths of ideology, in its illusions and privileged forms, as much as they are? If he is kept at a distance from the play by the play itself, it is not to spare him or to set him up as a Judge -- on the contrary, it is to take him and enlist him in this apparent distance, in this 'estrangement' -- to make him into this distance itself, the distance which is simply an active and living critique. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But then, no doubt, we must also reject the second model of the spectatorial consciousness -- a model that will haunt us until it has been rejected: the identification model. I am unable to answer this question fully here, but I shall try to pose it clearly: surely the invocation of a conception of identification (with the hero) to deal with the status of the spectatorial consciousness is to hazard a dubious correlation? Rigorously speaking, the concept of identification is a psychological, or, more precisely, a psychoanalytic concept. Far be it from me to contest the effectivity of psychological processes in the spectator seated in front of the stage. But it must be said that the phenomena of projection, sub- 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 149</B></FONT><P>

limation, etc., that can be observed, described and defined in controlled psychological situations cannot by themselves account for complex behaviour as specific as that of the spectator-attending-a-performance. This behaviour is primarily social and cultural aesthetic, and as such it is also ideological. Certainly, it is an important task to elucidate the insertion of concrete psychological processes (such as identification, sublimation, repression, etc., in their strict psychological senses) in behaviour which goes beyond them. But this first task cannot abolish the second -- the definition of the specificity of the spectatorial consciousness itself -- without lapsing into psychologism. If the consciousness cannot be reduced to a purely psychological consciousness, if it is a social, cultural and ideological consciousness, we cannot think its relation to the performance solely in the form of a psychological identification. Indeed, before (psychologically) identifying itself with the hero, the spectatorial consciousness recognizes itself in the ideological content of the play, and in the forms characteristic of this content. Before becoming the occasion for an identification (an identification with self in the species of another), the performance is, fundamentally, the occasion for a cultural and ideological recognition.<FONT SIZE=-2>[6]</FONT>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
6. We should not imagine that this self-recognition escapes the exigencies which, in the last instance, command the destiny of the ideology. Indeed, art is as much the desire for self-recognition as self-recognition itself. So, from the beginning, the unity I have assumed to be (in essentials) achieved so as to restrict the analysis, the stock of common myths, themes and aspirations which makes representation possible as a cultural and ideological phenomenon -- this unity is as much a desired or rejected unity as an achieved unity. In other words, in the theatrical world, as in the aesthetic world more generally ideology is always in essence the site of a competition and a struggle in which the sound and fury of humanity's political and social struggles is faintly or sharply echoed. I must say that it is very odd to put forward purely psychological processes (such as identification) as explanations of spectatorial behaviour, when we know that the effects of these processes are sometimes radically absent -- when we know that there are professional and other spectators who do not want to understand anything, even before the curtain rises or who, once the curtain has been raised, refuse to recognize themselves in the work presented to them, or in its interpretation. We need not look far for a wealth of examples. Was not Bertolazzi rejected by the late nineteenth century Italian bourgeoisie and forced into failure and poverty? And here in Paris, June 1962, was he not condemned -- along with Strehler -- without a hearing, a real hearing, by the leaders of 'Parisian' public consciousness? Whereas a large popular audience now accepts and recognizes him in Italy? 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 150</B></FONT><P>

This self-recognition presupposes as its principle an essential identity (which makes the processes of psychological identification themselves possible, in so far as they are psychological): the identity uniting the spectators and actors assembled in the same place on the same evening. Yes, we are first united by an institution -- the performance, but more deeply, by the same myths, the same themes, that govern us without our consent, by the same spontaneously lived ideology. Yes, even if it is the ideology of the poor <I>par excellence</I>, as in <I>El Nost Milan</I>, we still eat of the same bread, we have the same rages, the same rebellions, the same madness (at least in the memory where stalks this ever-imminent possibility), if not the same prostration before a time unmoved by any History. Yes, like Mother Courage, we have the same war at our gates, and a handsbreadth from us, if not in us, the same horrible blindness, the same dust in our eyes, the same earth in our mouths. We have the same dawn and night, we skirt the same abysses: our unconsciousness. We even share the same history -- and that is how it all started. That is why we were already ourselves in the play itself, from the beginning -- and then what does it matter whether we know the result, since it will never happen to anyone but ourselves, that is, still in our world. That is why the false problem of identification was solved from the beginning, even before it was posed, by the reality of recognition. The only question, then, is what is the fate of this tacit identity, this immediate self-recognition, what has the author already done with it? What will the actors set to work by the Dramaturg, by Brecht or Strehler, do with it? What will become of this ideological self-recognition? Will it exhaust itself in the dialectic of the consciousness of self, deepening its myths without ever escaping from them? Will it put this infinite mirror at the centre of the action? Or will it rather displace it, put it to one side, find it and lose it, leave it, return to it, expose it from afar to forces which are external -- and so drawn out -- that like those wine-glasses broken at a distance by a physical resonance, it comes to a sudden end as a heap of splinters on the floor. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To return finally to my attempt at definition, with the simple aim of posing the question anew and in a better form, we can see that the play itself <I>is</I> the spectator's consciousness -- for the essential reason that the spectator has no other consciousness than the content which unites him to the play in advance, and the develop- 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 151</B></FONT><P>

ment of this content in the play itself: the new result which the play produces from the self-recognition whose image and presence it is. Brecht was right: if the theatre's sole object were to be even a 'dialectical' commentary on this eternal self-recognition and non-recognition -- then the spectator would already know the tune, it is his own. If, on the contrary, the theatre's object is to destroy this intangible image, to set in motion the immobile, the eternal sphere of the illusory consciousness's mythical world, then the play is really the development, the production of a new consciousness in the spectator -- incomplete, like any other consciousness, but moved by this incompletion itself, this distance achieved, this inexhaustible work of criticism in action; the play is really the production of a new spectator, an actor who starts where the performance ends, who only starts so as to complete it, but in life. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I look back, and I am suddenly and irresistibly assailed by the question: are not these few pages, in their maladroit and groping way, simply that unfamiliar play <I>El Nost Milan</I>, performed on a June evening, pursuing in me its incomplete meaning, searching in me, despite myself, now that all the actors and sets have been cleared away, for the advent of its silent discourse?

The publication of the <I>1844 Manuscripts</I> is a real <I>event</I>, one I should like to draw to the attention of the readers of <I>La Pens&eacute;e.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp155">1</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is, first of all, a <I>literary</I> and <I>critical</I> event. Up till now, the <I>Manuscripts</I> have only been accessible to French readers in the Cost&egrave;s edition (Molitor, Vol. VI of the <I>Oeuvres Philosophiques </I>). Anyone who had to use it knows from experience that this partial text, with important arguments cut out and afflicted with errors and inaccuracies, could not serve as a tool for serious work. Thanks to E. Bottigelli, who is to be highly praised, we now have an <I>up-to-date</I> version (the most up to date there is, for Bottigelli has made use of the latest readings and emendations, sent him from the Marx-Engels Institute, Moscow) presented in the most reasonable order (that of the M.E.G.A.) and in a translation remarkable for its rigour, its attention to detail, its critical annotations, and may I add -- and this is particularly important -- for its <I>theoretical reliability</I> (it should be obvious that it is impossible to conceive of a good translator except on the express condition that he be <I>much more than a translator</I>, in fact, an expert, steeped not only in the work of his author but also in the conceptual and historical universe in which the latter was brought up. On this occasion this condition has been fulfilled.) 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But it is also a <I>theoretical</I> event. This is the text which has for thirty years been in the front line of the polemics between defenders of Marx and his opponents. Bottigelli gives a good account of the way the roles were shared out in this great debate. First Social Democrats (initially its first editors, Landshut and Mayer), then spiritualist philosophers, existentialist philosophers, phenomenological philosophers, etc., ensured this great text's success; but, as might be expected, in a spirit foreign to an understanding of Marx or even to the simple comprehension of his <I>formation.</I> The Economic-Philosophic manuscripts have nourished a whole ethical or (what amounts to the same thing) anthropological interpretation

of Marx -- making <I>Capital</I>, with its sense of perspective and apparent 'objectivity', merely the development of a youthful intuition which finds its major philosophical expression in this text and in its concepts: above all in the concepts of <I>alienation</I>, of <I>humanism</I>, of the <I>social essence of man</I>, etc. As we know, Marxists did not think to react until very late, and their reaction was often of the same order as their fears and haste: they have tended to defend Marx <I>in toto</I>, and to take over their opponents' thesis, thereby overestimating the <I>theoretical</I> prestige of the 1844 writings, but <I>to the profit of Capital.</I> On this point Bottigelli has some noteworthy comments (pp. <FONT SIZE=-2>IX, XXXIX</FONT>). They are a prelude to a demand which no serious commentator can avoid: the demand for a definition of a new and rigorous <I>method</I> of investigation, '<I>another method </I>' (p. <FONT SIZE=-2>X</FONT>) than that of a simple prospective or retrospective assimilation. So we <I>can</I> and <I>must</I> now deal with these <I>Manuscripts</I>, which have been the argument of a struggle, the pretext for a prosecution, or the defence's redoubt, by an assured method: as a <I>moment</I> in the formation of Marx's thought, which, like all the moments in an intellectual development, does obviously contain a promise for the future, but also pin-points an irreducible and <I>singular present.</I> It is no exaggeration to say that in this irreproachable translation Bottigelli has given us a <I>privileged object</I> which has a dual theoretical order of interest for Marxists: because it concerns the <I>formation</I>, or rather the <I>transformation</I> of Marx's thought, but also because it provides the Marxist theory of ideology with an excellent opportunity to exercise and test its method. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Finally, I should like to add that this translation is introduced by an important historical and theoretical <I>Presentation</I>, which not only brings us to the essential problems, but also situates and clarifies them. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What, in fact, is the <I>specific</I> feature of the <I>1844 Manuscripts</I> if they are compared with Marx's earlier writings? What is there in them which is radically new? The answer is given by the <I>fact</I> that the <I>Manuscripts</I> were the result of <I>Marx's discovery of political economy.</I> Naturally, this was not the first time that, as he put it himself, he experienced the 'embarrassment' of having to give an opinion on questions of an <I>economic</I> order (as early as 1842, the question of wood thefts evoked all the conditions of feudal agrarian property; similarly, also in 1842, an article on censorship 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 157</B></FONT><P>

and the freedom of the Press came up against the reality of 'industry', etc., etc.,), but these encounters with Economics only concerned <I>some</I> economic questions, and from the angle of <I>political</I> debates: in other words, these were not encounters with political economy, but with particular effects of an economic <I>policy</I>, or the particular economic conditions of social conflicts (<I>The Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right </I>). But in 1844 Marx was confronted with political economy <I>as such.</I> Engels had prepared the way with his 'brilliant sketch' of England. But Marx had been impelled in this direction, as had Engels himself, by the need to look beyond politics for the reasons for its insoluble internal conflicts. It is difficult to understand the <I>Manuscripts</I> without taking into account this <I>encounter</I>, this <I>first</I> encounter. In his Parisian period (February to May, 1844), decisive in this respect, Marx gave himself over to the classical economists (Say, Skarbek, Smith, Ricardo), he took copious notes which leave their mark in the body of the <I>Manuscripts</I> themselves (the first part contains long quotations) -- as if he wanted <I>to take into account a fact.</I> But while recognizing it, he states that <I>this fact rests on nothing</I>, at least in the economists he has read, it is ungrounded and lacks its own <I>principle.</I> So, in one and the same movement, the encounter with political economy is a <I>critical reaction</I> to political economy and a thorough investigation of its <I>foundations.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What is the source of Marx's conviction that Political Economy is unfounded? The contradictions it states and registers, or even accepts and traduces: and before all else, the major contradiction opposing the increasing <I>pauperization</I> of the workers and the remarkable <I>wealth</I> whose arrival in the modern world is celebrated by political economy. This is the crux, the stumbling-block of the optimistic science which is built upon this feeble argument, just as the wealth of the proprietors is on the poverty of the workers. This is also its disgrace, which Marx wants to suppress by giving economics the principle it lacks, the principle which will be its light and its verdict. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Here we come upon the other aspect of the <I>Manuscripts </I>: their <I>philosophy.</I> For this encounter of Marx's with political economy is, as Bottigelli correctly points out (pp. <FONT SIZE=-2>XXXIX, LIV, LXVII</FONT>, etc.), an encounter of <I>philosophy</I> with Political Economy. Naturally, not of any philosophy: of the philosophy erected by Marx through all 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 158</B></FONT><P>

his practico-theoretical experiments (Bottigelli sketches out the essential moments: the idealism of the very first writings, closer to Kant and Fichte than to Hegel; Feuerbach's anthropology), modified, corrected and amplified by this encounter itself. But a <I>philosophy</I> still, for all that, profoundly coloured by the Feuerbachian problematic (Bottigelli, p. <FONT SIZE=-2>XXXIX</FONT>) and leaning hesitantly towards a return from Feuerbach to Hegel. This is the philosophy which resolves the contradiction of Political Economy by <I>thinking it</I>, and through it, by thinking the whole of Political Economy and all its categories, with a key-concept as starting-point, the concept of <I>alienated labour.</I> This brings us to the real heart of the problem, and close to all the temptations both of idealism and of a hasty materialism. . . . For, <I>at first sight</I>, we are in familiar territory, I mean in that conceptual landscape in which we can identify private property, capital, money, the division of labour, the alienation of the labourer, his emancipation and the humanism which is his promised future. These are all, or <I>nearly all</I>, categories we shall meet again in <I>Capital</I>, and on this basis we might accept them as anticipations of <I>Capital</I>, or better, as a project for <I>Capital</I>, or even as <I>Capital</I> crayoned, already outlined, but only as a sketch, which, if it has the genius of the completed work, has not yet been filled in as it is in the latter. Painters do pencil sketches of this kind, drawn in one movement, new-born, and precisely because of this emergence, greater than the works they contain. There is something of this glitter in the fascination of the <I>Manuscripts</I>, in the irresistibility of their <I>logic</I> (Bottigelli correctly notes their '<I>rigorous reasoning </I>' pp. <FONT SIZE=-2>XXXIII, LXII, LIV,</FONT> and their 'implacable logic') and the conviction of their dialectic. But there is also the conviction, the <I>meaning</I> conferred by this logic and rigour on the concepts we recognize in it, and therefore the very <I>meaning</I> of this logic and rigour: <I>a meaning which is still philosophical</I>, and when I say philosophical I am using it in <I>the same sense</I> as that to which Marx later linked <I>an absolute condemnation.</I> For rigour and dialectic are worth no more than the meaning they serve and add lustre to. One day we shall have to study this text in detail and give a word-by-word explanation of it; discuss the theoretical status and theoretical role assigned to the key concept of <I>alienated labour </I>; examine this notion's conceptual field, and recognize that it does fill the role Marx then assigned it, the role of <I>original basis </I>; 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 159</B></FONT><P>

but also that it can only fill this role so long as it <I>receives it</I> as a mandate and commission from a whole <I>conception of Man</I> which can derive from the <I>essence of Man</I> the necessity and content of the familiar <I>economic concepts.</I> In short, we shall have to discover beneath these terms imminently awaiting a future meaning, the meaning that still keeps them prisoners of a philosophy that is exercising its last prestige and power over them. And except that I would rather not abuse my freedom to anticipate this proof, I should almost say that <I>beneath this relation</I>, that is, beneath philosophy's relation of <I>radical domination</I> over a content soon to become <I>radically independent</I>, the Marx <I>furthest from Marx</I> is this Marx, the Marx on the brink, on the eve, on the threshold -- as if, before the rupture, in order to achieve it, he had to give philosophy every chance, its last, this absolute empire over its opposite, this boundless theoretical triumph, that is, <I>its defeat.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Bottigelli's presentation takes us to the heart of these problems. Among the most remarkable sections are the pages where he discusses the theoretical status of alienated labour, where he compares the economic concepts of the <I>Manuscripts</I> with the economic concepts of <I>Capital</I>, where he raises the basic question of the theoretical <I>nature</I> (for Marx in 1844) of the <I>just encountered</I> political economy. The simple sentence: 'Bourgeois political economy appeared to Marx as a <I>kind of phenomenology </I>' (p. <FONT SIZE=-2>XLI</FONT>) seems to me to be decisive, also, the fact that Marx accepts political economy precisely <I>as it presents itself</I> (p. <FONT SIZE=-2>LXVII</FONT>) without questioning the content of its concepts or their systematicity as he was to do later on: it is this 'abstraction' of the <I>Economy</I> that authorizes the other 'abstraction': that of the <I>Philosophy</I> which is used <I>to give it a basis.</I> So a recognition of the <I>philosophy</I> at work in the <I>Manuscripts</I> necessarily returns us to <I>our point of departure </I>: the <I>encounter</I> with political economy, forcing us to ask the question: what is the <I>reality</I> that Marx <I>encountered</I> in the terms of <I>this</I> economics? The economy itself? Or more likely an <I>economic ideology</I> inseparable from the economists' theories, that is, in the powerful expression quoted above, <I>a</I> '<I>phenomenology </I>'?

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I have only one more remark to make before closing. If some people find this interpretation disconcerting, it is because they give credence to a <I>confusion</I> (a confusion difficult for our contemporaries to avoid, be it said, for a whole historical past snares them a dis- 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 160</B></FONT><P>

tinction between these roles) between what have been called <I>the political positions</I> and <I>the theoretical positions</I> adopted by Marx in his formative period. Bottigelli has seen this difficulty very well and he takes it by the horns when, for example, he writes (p. <FONT SIZE=-2>XXXIII</FONT>) that the <I>Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right</I> (1843) 'signals Marx's adhesion to the cause of the proletariat, that is, to Communism. <I>This does not mean that historical materialism had already been worked out. </I>' So it is a <I>political</I> and <I>theoretical</I> reading of the writings of Marx's youth. A text such as <I>On the Jewish Question</I>, for instance, is a text <I>politically committed</I> to the struggle for Communism. But it is a profoundly 'ideological' text: so <I>it cannot</I>, <I>theoretically</I>, <I>be identified with the later texts which were to define historical materialism</I>, and which were to be capable of illuminating even the basis of that real Communist movement of 1843 which was born before them and independently of them, and to whose side Marx had rallied at that time. Anyway, even our own experience should remind us that it is possible to be 'Communist' without being 'Marxist'. This distinction is essential if we are to avoid the <I>political trap</I> of confusing Marx's theoretical positions with his <I>political</I> positions, and justifying the former from the latter. But this illuminating distinction brings us back to the demand formulate by Bottigelli: we must conceive of '<I>another method </I>' to explain Marx's <I>formation</I>, that is, his <I>moments</I>, his <I>stages</I>, his '<I>presents </I>' in short his <I>transformation </I>: to explain this <I>paradoxical dialectic</I> whose most extraordinary episode this is, the <I>Manuscripts</I> that Marx never published, but which, no doubt precisely for that reason, show him naked in his triumphant and vanquished thoughts, on the threshold of becoming himself at last by a <I>radical</I> realignment, the last: that is, the <I>first.</I>

<I>Remarks on the Terminology Adopted</I>           

<P>
This article proposes the term <I>Theory</I> (with a capital T to designate Marxist 'philosophy' (dialectical materialism) -- and reserves the term <I>philosophy</I> for <I>ideological</I> philosophies. It was in this sense of an <I>ideological</I> formation that the term <I>philosophy</I> had already been used in the article '<A HREF="http://marx2mao.phpwebhosting.com/Other/FM65i#s3">Contradiction and Overdetermination</A>'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This terminology, distinguishing between (ideological) philosophy and Theory (or Marxist philosophy constituted in rupture with philosophical ideology) is authorized by several passages from the works of Marx and Engels. In <I>The German Ideology</I>, Marx always uses philosophy to mean ideology pure and simple. And Engels writes, in the earlier preface to his <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/AD78.html">Anti-D&uuml;hring</A></I>, 'If theoreticians are semi-initiates in the sphere of natural science, then natural scientists today are actually just as much so in the sphere of theory, in <I>the sphere of what hitherto was called philosophy </I>' (English translation, Moscow, 1959, p. 454). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This remark proves that Engels felt the need to encapsulate the difference between ideological philosophies and Marx's absolutely new philosophical project in a terminological distinction. He proposed to register this difference by designating Marxist philosophy by the term <I>theory.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   However, the fact that a new terminology is well-founded does not mean that it can really be manipulated and diffused. It seems difficult to go against familiar usage by designating the scientific philosophy founded by Marx as Theory. Also, the capital T which distinguishes it from other uses of the word <I>theory</I> obviously cannot be perceived aurally. For these reasons, since writing the article 'On the Materialist Dialectic', I have reverted to the terminology in current use, and speak of <I>philosophy</I> to refer to Marx himself, therefore using the term <I>Marxist philosophy.</I>

If I had to sum up in one sentence all the criticisms I have received, I should say that, while acknowledging the interest of my articles, they regard them as theoretically and politically dangerous. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   These critics formulate two essential grounds for objection, with various modifications: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (1) That I have stressed the <I>discontinuity</I> between Marx and Hegel. The result: what remains of the 'rational kernel' of the Hegelian dialectic, of the dialectic itself, and, in consequence, of <I>Capital</I> itself and the basic law of our age?<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  (2) That by proposing the concept of 'overdetermined contradiction', I have substituted a 'pluralist' conception of history for the Marxist 'monist' conception. The result: what remains of historical necessity, of its unity, of the determinant role of the economy -- and, in consequence, of the basic law of our age?<FONT SIZE=-2>[2]</FONT> 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
1. R. Garaudy: 'We should realize how much we risk throwing overboard if we underestimate the Hegelian heritage in Marx: not only his youthful works, Engels and Lenin, but also <I>Capital</I> itself.' R. Garaudy, '<I>A propos des manuscrits de 44 </I>', <I>Cahiers du Communisme</I>, March 1963, p. 118.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
2. G. Mury: 'It would hardly be reasonable to suppose that he [L. A.] should have introduced with such a fanfare a new concept to express a truth known since Marx and Engels. It is more likely that he thought it essential to insist on the existence of an unbridgeable gulf between the determinations coming from the infrastructure and those coming from the superstructure. This must be why he refuses to invert the poles of the contradiction between civil society and the State that Hegel proposed by following Marx in making civil society the dominant pole and the State the phenomenon of this essence. But this solution by continuity artificially introduced into the dialectic of history prevents him from seeing how the internal principle of capitalism itself in its own specific contradiction engenders by its own development the highest stage of imperialism, the unevenness of progress and the necessity for the weakest link' (<I>La Pens&eacute;e</I>, April 1963,  '<I>Mat&eacute;rialisme et Hyperempirisme </I>', p. 49). R. Garaudy: 'Whatever the complexity of the mediations, human practice is one, and it is the dialectic of human practice that constitutes the motor of history. To blur this with the (real) multiplicity of "overdeterminations" is to obscure the essence of [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 164. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] Marx's <I>Capital</I> which is above all a study of this major contradiction, this basic law of the development of bourgeois society. Once this is obscured, how is it possible to conceive the objective existence of a basic law of development of our own epoch, the epoch of the transition to socialism?' (<I>op. cit.</I>, p. 119).

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 164</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Two problems are at issue in these objections, and in my essay. The first concerns the Hegelian dialectic: what is the 'rationality' that Marx attributes to it? The second concerns the Marxist dialectic: what is the <I>specificify</I> that distinguishes it rigorously from the Hegelian dialectic? Two problems which are in fact only two parts of a single problem, since in its two aspects it always remains a matter of a more rigorous and clearer understanding of Marx's thought.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I shall return later to the 'rationality' of the Hegelian dialectic. For the moment, I should like to examine more closely the second aspect of the problem (which governs the other): the <I>specificity</I> of the Marxist dialectic.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The reader should realize that I am doing all I can to give the <I>concepts</I> I use a <I>strict</I> meaning, and that if he wants to understand these concepts he will have to pay attention to this rigour, and, in so far as it is not imaginary, he will have to adopt it himself. Need I remind him that without the rigour demanded by its object there can be no question of <I>theory</I>, that is, of theoretical practice in the strict sense of the term?

Practical Solution and Theoretical Problem. Why Theory?
</FONT></B>
<P>

The problem posed by my last study -- what constitutes Marx's 'inversion' of the Hegelian dialectic, what is the specific difference that distinguishes the Marxist dialectic from the Hegelian dialectic? -- is a theoretical problem. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To say that it is a <I>theoretical</I> problem implies that its theoretical solution should give us a new knowledge, organically linked to the other knowledges of Marxist theory. To say that it is a theoretical <I>problem</I> implies that we are not dealing merely with an imaginary difficulty, but with a really existing difficulty posed us in the form of a <I>problem</I>, that is, in a form governed by imperative conditions: definition of the field of (theoretical) knowledges in which the 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 165</B></FONT><P>

problem is posed (situated), of the exact <I>location</I> of its posing, and of the concepts required to pose it. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Only the position, examination and resolution of the problem, that is, the <I>theoretical practice</I> we are about to embark on, can provide the <I>proof</I> that these conditions have been respected. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Now, in this particular case, what has to be expressed in the form of a theoretical problem and its solution <I>already exists in Marxist practice.</I> Not only has Marxist practice come up against this 'difficulty', confirmed that it was indeed real rather than imaginary, but what is more, it has, within its own limits, 'settled' it and surmounted it in fact. In the practical state, the solution to our theoretical problem has already existed for a long time in Marxist practice. So to pose and resolve our theoretical problem ultimately means to express theoretically the '<I>solution </I>' <I>existing in the practical state</I>, that Marxist practice has found for a real difficulty it has encountered in its development, whose existence it has noted, and, according to its own submission, settled.<FONT SIZE=-2>[3]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So we are merely concerned with filling in a 'gap' between theory and practice on a particular point. We are not setting Marxism any imaginary or subjective problem, asking it to 'resolve' the 'problems' of 'hyperempiricism', nor even what Marx called the difficulties a philosopher has in his <I>personal</I> relations with a concept. No. The problem posed<FONT SIZE=-2>[4]</FONT> exists (and has existed) in the form of a difficulty signalled by Marxist practice. Its solution exists in Marxist practice. So we only have to express it theoretically. But this simple theoretical <I>expression</I> of a solution that exists in the practical state cannot be taken for granted: it requires a real theoretical labour, not only to work out the specific <I>concept</I> or 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
3. <I>Settled </I>: this is the very word Marx used in the Preface to the <I>Contribution</I> (1858) when, reviewing his past and evoking his meeting with Engels in Brussels, spring 1845 and the drafting of <I>The German Ideology</I> he speaks of <I>settling accounts</I> (<I>Abrechnung </I>) with 'our erstwhile philosophical conscience'. The Afterword to the second edition of <I>Capital</I> openly records this settlement, which, in good accounting style, includes the acknowledgement of a debt: the acknowledgement of the 'rational side' of the Hegelian dialectic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
4. Of course, this is not the first time this problem has been posed! It is at the moment the object of important works by Marxist investigators in the U.S.S.R and, to my knowledge, in Rumania, Hungary and Democratic Germany, as well as in Italy, where it has inspired historical and theoretical studies of great scientific interest (Della Volpe, Rossi, Colletti, Merker, etc.).
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 166</B></FONT><P>

<I>knowledge</I> of this practical resolution -- but also for the real destruction of the ideological confusions, illusions or inaccuracies that may exist, by a radical critique (a critique which takes them by the root). So this <I>simple</I> theoretical 'expression' implies both the <I>production</I> of a knowledge and the <I>critique</I> of an illusion, in one movement. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And if I am asked: but why take all this trouble to express a 'truth' 'known' for such a long time?<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp166">5</A>]</FONT> -- my answer is that, if we are still using the term in its strictest sense, the existence of this truth has been <I>signalled</I>, <I>recognized</I> for a long time, but it has not been <I>known.</I> For the (practical) <I>recognition</I> of an existence cannot pass for a <I>knowledge</I> (that is, for <I>theory </I>) except in the imprecision of a confused thought. And if I am then asked: but what use is there in posing this problem <I>in theory</I> if its solution has already existed for a long time in the practical state? why give a theoretical expression to this practical solution, a theoretical expression it has so far done quite well without? what do we gain by this 'speculative' investigation that we do not possess already? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   One sentence is enough to answer this question: Lenin's 'Without revolutionary theory, no revolutionary practice'. Generalizing it: theory is essential to practice, to the forms of practice that it helps bring to birth or to grow, as well as to the practice it is the theory of. But the transparency of this sentence is not enough; we must also know its <I>titles to validity</I>, so we must pose the question: what are we to understand by <I>theory</I>, if it is to be essential to <I>practice </I>? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I shall only discuss the aspects of this theme that are indispensable to our investigation. I propose to use the following definitions, as essential preliminary hypotheses. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   By <I>practice</I> in general I shall mean any process of <I>transformation</I> of determinate given raw material into a determinate <I>product</I>, a transformation effected by a determinate human labour, using determinate means (of 'production'). In any practice thus conceived, the <I>determinant</I> moment (or element) is neither the raw material nor the product, but the practice in the narrow sense: the moment of the <I>labour of transformation</I> itself, which sets to work, 

<A NAME="fnp166">

<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
5. G. Mury quite correctly says: ' . . . it would hardly be reasonable to suppose that he [L. A.] should have introduced . . . a new concept to express a truth known since Marx and Engels' (<I>op. cit.</I>).
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 167</B></FONT><P>

in a specific structure, men, means and a technical method of utilizing the means. This general definition of practice covers the possibility of particularity: there are different practices which are really distinct, even though they belong organically to the same complex totality. Thus, 'social practice', the complex unity of the practices existing in a determinate society, contains a large number of distinct practices. This complex unity of 'social practice' is structured, we shall soon see how, in such a way that in the last resort the determinant practice in it is the practice of transformation of a given nature (raw material) into useful <I>products</I> by the activity of living men working through the <I>methodically organized</I> employment of determinate <I>means of production</I> within the framework of determinate relations of production. As well as production social practice includes other essential levels: political practice -- which in Marxist parties is no longer spontaneous but organized on the basis of the scientific theory of historical materialism, and which transforms its raw materials: social relations, into a determinate product (new social relations); ideological practice (ideology, whether religious, political, moral, legal or artistic, also transforms its object: men's 'consciousness'): and finally, <I>theoretical practice.</I> Ideology is not always taken seriously as an existing practice: but to recognize this is the indispensable prior condition for any theory of ideology. The existence of a <I>theoretical practice</I> is taken seriously even more rarely: but this prior condition is indispensable to an understanding of what theory itself, and its relation to 'social practice' are for Marxism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Here we need a second definition. By theory, in this respect, I shall mean a <I>specific form of practice</I>, itself belonging to the complex unity of the 'social practice' of a determinate human society. Theoretical practice falls within the general definition of practice. It works on a raw material (representations, concepts, facts) which it is given by other practices, whether 'empirical', 'technical' or 'ideological'. In its most general form theoretical practice does not only include <I>scientific</I> theoretical practice, but also pre-scientific theoretical practice, that is, 'ideological' theoretical practice (the forms of 'knowledge' that make up the prehistory of a science, and their 'philosophies'). The theoretical practice of a science is always completely distinct from the ideological theoretical practice of its prehistory: this distinction takes the form of a 'qualitative' 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 168</B></FONT><P>

theoretical and historical discontinuity which I shall follow Bachelard in calling an 'epistemological break'. This is not the place to discuss the dialectic in action in the advent of this 'break': that is, the labour of specific theoretical transformation which installs it in each case, which establishes a science by detaching it from the ideology of its past and by revealing this past as ideological. Restricting myself to the essential point as far as our analysis is concerned, I shall take up a position beyond the 'break' within the constituted science, and use the following nomenclature: I shall call <I>theory</I> any theoretical practice of a <I>scientific</I> character. I shall call 'theory' (in inverted commas) the determinate <I>theoretical system</I> of a real science (its basic concepts in their more or less contradictory unity at a given time): for example, the theory of universal attraction, wave mechanics, etc, . . . or again, the '<I>theory </I>' of historical materialism. In its 'theory' any determinate science reflects within the complex unity of its concepts (a unity which, I should add, is more or less problematic) the results, which will henceforth be the conditions and means, of its own theoretical practice. I shall call Theory (with a capital T), general theory, that is, the Theory of practice in general, itself elaborated on the basis of the Theory of existing theoretical practices (of the sciences), which transforms into 'knowledges' (scientific truths) the ideological product of existing 'empirical' practices (the concrete activity of men). This Theory is the materialist <I>dialectic</I> which is none other than dialectical materialism. These definitions are necessary for us to be able to give an answer to this question: what is the use of a theoretical expression of a solution which already exists in the practical state? -- an answer with a theoretical basis. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   When Lenin said 'without theory, no revolutionary action', he meant one particular theory, the theory of the Marxist science of the development of social formations (historical materialism). The proposition is to be found in <I><A HREF="../Lenin/WD02NB.html">What is to be Done</A>?</I>, where Lenin examined the organizational methods and objectives of the Russian Social-Democratic Party in 1902. At that time he was struggling against an opportunist policy that tagged along behind the 'spontaneity' of the masses; his aim was to transform it into a revolutionary practice based on 'theory', that is, on the (Marxist) science of the development of the social formation concerned (Russian 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 169</B></FONT><P>

society at that time). But in expressing this thesis, Lenin was doing more than he said: by reminding Marxist political practice of the necessity for the 'theory' which is its basis, he was in fact expressing a thesis of relevance to Theory, that is, to the Theory of practice in general -- the materialist dialectic. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So theory is important to practice in a double sense: for 'theory' is important to its own practice, directly. But the <I>relation</I> of a 'theory' to its practice, in so far as it is at issue, on condition that it is reflected and expressed, is also relevant to the general Theory (the dialectic) in which is theoretically expressed the essence of theoretical practice in general, through it the essence of practice in general, and through it the essence of the transformations, of the 'development' of things in general. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To return to our original problem: we find that the theoretical expression of a practical solution involves Theory, that is, the dialectic. The exact theoretical expression of the dialectic is relevant first of all to those practices in which the Marxist dialectic is active; for these practices (Marxist 'theory' and politics) need the concept of their practice (of the dialectic) in their development, if they are not to find themselves defenceless in the face of qualitatively new forms of this development (new situations, new 'problems') -- or to lapse, or relapse, into the various forms of opportunism, theoretical or practical. These 'surprises' and deviations, attributable in the last resort to 'ideological errors', that is, to a <I>theoretical</I> deficiency, are always costly, and may be very costly. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But Theory is also essential for the transformation of domains in which a Marxist theoretical practice does not yet really exist. In most of these domains the question has not yet been 'settled' as it has in <I>Capital.</I> The Marxist theoretical practice of <I>epistemology</I>, of the history of science, of the history of ideology, of the history of philosophy, of the history of art, has yet in large part to be constituted. Not that there are not Marxists who are working in these domains and have acquired much real experience there, but they do not have behind them the equivalent of <I>Capital</I> or of the revolutionary practice of a century of Marxists. Their practice is largely <I>in front of them</I>, it still has to be developed, or even founded, that is, it has to be set on correct theoretical bases so that it corresponds to a <I>real</I> object, not to a presumed or ideological 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 170</B></FONT><P>

object, and so that it is a truly theoretical practice, not a technical practice. It is for this purpose that they need Theory, that is, the materialist dialectic, as the sole method that can anticipate their theoretical practice by drawing up its formal conditions. In this case, the utilization of Theory is not a matter of <I>applying</I> its formulae (the formulae of the dialectic, of materialism) to a pre-existing content. Lenin himself criticized Engels and Plekhanov for having <I>applied</I> the dialectic externally to 'examples' from the natural sciences.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp170">6</A>]</FONT> The external application of a concept is never equivalent to a <I>theoretical practice.</I> The application changes nothing in the externally derived truth but its <I>name</I>, a re-baptism incapable of producing any real transformation of the truths that receive it. The application of the 'laws' of the dialectic to such and such a result of physics, for example, makes not one iota of difference to the structure or development of the theoretical <I>practice</I> of physics; worse, it may turn into an ideological fetter. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   However, and this is a thesis essential to Marxism, it is not enough to reject the dogmatism of the <I>application</I> of the forms of the dialectic in favour of the <I>spontaneity</I> of existing theoretical practices, for we know that there is no <I>pure</I> theoretical practice, no perfectly transparent science which throughout its history as a science will always be preserved, by I know not what Grace, from the threats and taints of idealism, that is, of the <I>ideologies</I> which besiege it; we know that a 'pure' science only exists on condition that it continually frees itself from the ideology which occupies it, haunts it, or lies in wait for it. The inevitable price of this purification and liberation is a continuous struggle against ideology itself, that is, against idealism, a struggle whose reasons and aims can be clarified by Theory (dialectical materialism) and guided by it as by

no other method in the world. What, then, should we say for the <I>spontaneity</I> of those triumphant <I>avant-garde</I> disciplines devoted to precise pragmatic interests; which are not strictly sciences but claim to be since they use methods which are 'scientific' (but defined independently of the specificity of their presumed objects); which think, like every true science, that they have an <I>object</I>, when they are merely dealing with a certain given reality that is anyway disputed and torn between several competing 'sciences': a certain domain of phenomena not yet constituted into scientific facts and therefore not <I>unified </I>; disciplines which in their present form cannot constitute true theoretical practices because most often they only have the unity of a <I>technical practice</I> (<I>examples </I>: social psychology, and sociology and psychology in many of their branches)?<FONT SIZE=-2>[7]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The only Theory able to raise, if not to pose, the essential question of the status of these disciplines, to criticize ideology in all its guises, including the disguises of technical practice as sciences, is the Theory of theoretical practice (as distinct from ideological

7. Theoretical practice produces knowledges which can then figure as <I>means</I> that will serve the ends of a technical practice. Any technical practice is defined by its ends: such and such effects to be produced in such and such an object in such and such a situation. The means depend on the ends. Any theoretical practice uses among other means knowledges which intervene as procedures: either knowledges borrowed from outside, from existing sciences, or 'knowledges' produced by the technical practice itself in pursuance of its ends. In every case, the relation between technique and knowledge is an <I>external</I>, unreflected relation, radically different from the internal, reflected relation between a science and its knowledges. It is this exteriority which justifies Lenin's thesis of the necessity to <I>import</I> Marxist theory into the spontaneous political practice of the working class. Left to itself, a spontaneous (technical) practice produces only the 'theory' it needs as a means to produce the ends assigned to it: this 'theory' is never more than the reflection of this end, uncriticized, unknown, in its means of realization, that is, it is a <I>by-product</I> of the reflection of the technical practice's end on its means. A 'theory' which does not question the end whose <I>by-product</I> it is remains a prisoner of this end and of the 'realities' which have imposed it as an end. Examples of this are many of the branches of psychology and sociology, and of Economics, of Politics, of Art, etc. . . . This point is crucial if we are to identify the most dangerous ideological menace: the creation and success of so-called theories which have nothing to do with real theory but are mere <I>by-products</I> of technical activity. A belief in the 'spontaneous' theoretical virtue of technique lies at the root of this ideology, the ideology constituting the essence of Technocratic Thought.

practice): the materialist dialectic or dialectical materialism, the conception of the Marxist dialectic in its <I>specificity.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   For we are all agreed that where a really existing science has to be defended against an encroaching ideology, where what is truly science's and what is ideology's has to be discerned without a really scientific element being taken by chance for ideology, as occasionally happens, or, as often happens, an ideological element being taken for a scientific element . . . , where (and this is very important politically) the claims of the ruling technical practices have to be criticized and the true theoretical practices that socialism, communism and our age will need more and more established, where these tasks which all demand the intervention of the <I>Marxist</I> dialectic are concerned, it is very obvious that there can be no question of making do with a formulation of Theory, that is, of the materialist dialectic, which has the disadvantage of being <I>inexact</I>, in fact of being very inexact, as inexact as the Hegelian dialectic. Of course, even this imprecision may correspond to a certain degree of reality and as such be endowed with a certain <I>practical</I> meaning, serving as a reference point or index (as Lenin says, 'The same is true of Engels. But it is "in the interests of popularization",' <I>Philosophical Notebooks</I>, p. 359), not only in education, but also in struggle. But if a practice is to be able to make use of imprecise formulations, it is absolutely essential that this practice should at least be 'true', that on occasion it should be able to do without the expression of Theory and recognize itself globally in an imprecise Theory. But if a practice <I>does not really exist</I>, if it must be <I>constituted</I>, then imprecision becomes an obstacle in itself. Those Marxist investigators working in <I>avant-garde</I> domains such as the theory of ideologies (law, ethics, religion, art, philosophy), the theory of the history of the sciences and of their ideological prehistory, epistemology (theory of the theoretical practice of mathematics and other natural sciences), etc. . . . , these risky but existing <I>avant-garde</I> domains; those who pose themselves difficult problems even in the domain of Marxist theoretical practice (the domain of history); not to speak of those other revolutionary  'investigators' who are confronted by political difficulties in radically new forms (Africa, Latin America, the transition to communism, etc.); if all these investigators had only the Hegelian dialectic instead of the Marxist dialectic, even if the former were 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 173</B></FONT><P>

purged of Hegel's ideological <I>system</I>, even if it were declared to have been 'inverted' (if this inversion amounts to applying the Hegelian dialectic to the real instead of to the Idea), they would certainly not get very far in its company! So, whether we are dealing with a confrontation with something new in the domain of a real practice, or with the foundation of a real practice we all need the materialist dialectic as such.

So we shall start by considering practices in which the Marxist dialectic as such is in action: Marxist theoretical practice and Marxist political practice. 

<P>

<BR>
<I>Marxist Theoretical Practice</I>
</FONT>
<P>

So a practice of theory does exist; theory is a specific practice which acts on its own object and ends in its own <I>product </I>: a <I>knowledge.</I> Considered in itself, any theoretical work presupposes a given raw material and some 'means of production' (the concepts of the 'theory' and the way they are used: the method). The raw material worked by theoretical labour may be very 'ideological' if the science is just coming into being; where an already constituted and developed science is concerned, it may be material that has already been elaborated theoretically, concepts which have already been formed. Very schematically, we may say that the means of theoretical labour, which are an absolute condition of its existence -- 'theory' and method -- represent the 'active side' of theoretical practice, the determinant moment of the process. The knowledge of the process of this theoretical practice in its generality, that is, as the specified form or real difference of the practice, itself a specified form of the general process of transformation, of the 'development of things', constitutes a first theoretical elaboration of Theory, that is, of the materialist dialectic. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Now, a real theoretical practice (one that produces knowledges) may be well able to do its duty as theory without necessarily feeling the need to make the Theory of its own practice, of its process. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 174</B></FONT><P>

This is the case with the majority of sciences; they do have a 'theory' (their corpus of concepts), but it is not a Theory of their theoretical practice. The moment of the Theory of theoretical practice, that is, the moment in which a 'theory' feels the need for the Theory of its own practice -- the moment of the Theory of method in the general sense -- always occurs <I>post festum</I>, to help it surmount practical or 'theoretical' difficulties, resolve problems insoluble for the movement of practice immersed in its activities and therefore theoretically blind, or face up to even deeper crises. But the science can do its duty, that is, produce knowledges, for a long time before it feels the need to make the Theory of what it is doing, the theory of its practice, of its 'method'. Look at Marx. He wrote ten books as well as the monument that is <I>Capital</I> without ever writing a <I>Dialectics.</I> He talked of writing it, but never started. He never found the time. Which means that he never took the time, for at that period the Theory of his own theoretical practice was not <I>essential</I> to the development of his theory, that is, to the fruitfulness of his own practice. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   However, Marx's <I>Dialectics</I> would have been very relevant to us today, since it would have been the Theory of Marx's theoretical practice, that is, exactly a determinant theoretical form of the solution (that exists in the practical state) to the problem we are dealing with: the problem of the specificity of the Marxist <I>dialectic.</I> This practical solution, this <I>dialectic</I>, exists in Marx's theoretical practice, and we can see it in action there. The method Marx used in his theoretical practice, in his scientific work on the 'given' that he transformed into knowledge, this method is precisely the <I>Marxist dialectic </I>; and it is precisely <I>this dialectic</I> which contains inside it in a practical state the solution to the problem of the relations between Marx and Hegel, of the reality of that famous 'inversion' which is Marx's gesture to us, in the Afterword to the Second Edition of <I>Capital</I>, warning us that he has settled his relations with the Hegelian dialectic. That is why today we so miss the <I>Dialectics</I> which Marx did not need and which he refused us, even though we know perfectly well that we have it, and where it is: in Marx's theoretical works, in <I>Capital</I>, etc. -- yes, and of course this is the main thing, we can find it there, but <I>not in a theoretical state! </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[8]</FONT>

   Engels and Lenin knew this.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp175">9</A>]</FONT> They knew that the Marxist dialectic existed in <I>Capital</I>, <I>but only</I> in a practical state. They <I>also</I> knew that Marx did not give us a 'dialectic' in a <I>theoretical</I> state. So they did not, could not -- except in extremely general expositions or in historically defined situations of theoretical urgency -- confuse the <I>gesture</I> with which Marx indicated that he had <I>settled</I> his relations with Hegel with the <I>knowledge</I> of this solution, that is, with the theory of this solution. Marx's '<I>gestures </I>' as to the 'inversion' might well serve as <I>reference points</I> whereby we can situate and orient ourselves in the ideological domain: they do represent a gesture towards, a practical recognition of the existence of the solution, but they do not represent a rigorous knowledge of it. That is why Marx's gestures can and must <I>provoke</I> us into theory: into as rigorous as possible an expression of the practical solution whose existence they indicate.

<I>Marxist Political Practice</I>
</FONT>
<P>

The same is true of the Marxist political practice of the class struggle. In my last essay I took as an example the 1917 Revolution, but a hundred others from close at hand or far afield would have done just as well, as everyone must know very well. In this example, we see the 'dialectic' we obtained from Marx in action and under test (the two are one and the same thing), and in it the 'inversion' that distinguishes him from Hegel -- but again, <I>in a practical state.</I> This dialectic comes from Marx, for the practice of the Bolshevik Party was based on the dialectic in <I>Capital</I>, on Marxist 'theory'. In the practice of the class struggle during the 1917 Revolution, and in Lenin's reflections on it, we do have the Marxist dialectic, but in a practical state. And here again we can see that this political <I>practice</I>, which has its defined raw material, its tools and its method, which, like any other practice, also produces transformations (which are not <I>knowledges</I>, but a revolution in <I>social</I>

In <I>Capital</I>, Marx applied to a single science logic, dialectics and the theory of knowledge of materialism (three words are not needed: it is one and the same thing) which has taken everything valuable in Hegel and developed it further' (<I>Philosophical Notebooks</I>, <I>op. cit.</I>, p. 319).

<I>relations </I>), this practice <I>also</I> may exist and develop, at least for a time, without feeling the need to make the theory of its own practice, the Theory of its 'method'. It may exist, survive and even progress without it; just like any other practice -- until the moment in which its object (the existing world of the society that it is transforming) opposes enough resistance to it to <I>force</I> it to fill in this gap, to question and think its own method, so as to produce the adequate solutions, the <I>means</I> of producing them, and, in particular, so as to produce in the '<I>theory </I>' which is its basis (the theory of the existing social formation) the <I>new knowledges</I> corresponding to the content of the new 'stages' of its development. An example of these 'new knowledges': what have been called the contributions of 'Leninism' for the period of imperialism in the phase of inter-imperialist wars; and what will later be called by a name which does not exist as yet, the theoretical contributions necessary for the present period, when, in the struggle for peaceful coexistence the first <I>revolutionary</I> forms are appearing in certain so-called 'underdeveloped' countries out of their struggles for national independence. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   After this, it may come as a surprise to read that the practice of the class struggle has not been reflected in the theoretical form of <I>method</I> or <I>Theory</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[10]</FONT> when we seem to have ten decisive texts by Lenin, the most famous of which is <I>What is to be Done?.</I> But while this last text, for example, may define the theoretical and historical bases for Russian Communist practice, and prepare the way for a programme of action, it does not constitute a theoretical reflection on political practice as such. It does not, and did not intend to, constitute the theory of its own method in the general sense of Theory. So it is not a text on the dialectic, although the dialectic is certainly active in it. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   For a better understanding of this point, let us take as an example the texts by Lenin on the 1917 Revolution that I quoted or, gave precise references to previously.<FONT SIZE=-2>[11]</FONT> The status of these texts should be made clear. They are not the texts of a historian, but of a political leader tearing himself away from the struggle for an

hour or two so as to speak of the struggle to the men involved in it, and give them an understanding of it. So they are texts for direct political use, written down by a man involved in the revolution who is reflecting on his practical experience within the field of his experience itself. I regard it as a great honour to have been criticized for what amounts to having respected the form of Lenin's reflections down to the details and even the expression, presenting them for what they are without any attempt to 'supersede' them straightaway with a real historical analysis.<FONT SIZE=-2>[12]</FONT> Yes, some of Lenin's reflections do have all the appearances of what might be called a 'pluralism' or a 'hyperempiricism', 'the theory of factors', etc., in their invocation of the multiple and exceptional circumstances which induced and made possible the triumph of the revolution.<FONT SIZE=-2>[13]</FONT> I took them as they were, not in their appearance but in their essence, not in their apparent 'pluralism' but in the deeply theoretical significance of this 'appearance'. Indeed, the meaning of these texts of Lenin's is not a simple description of a given situation, an empirical enumeration of various paradoxical or exceptional elements: on the contrary, it is an <I>analysis</I> of theoretical scope. They deal with a reality absolutely essential to political practice, a reality that we must <I>think</I> if we are to attain the specific essence of this practice. These texts are an analysis of the structure of the field, of the object, or (to return to our earlier terminology) of the specific raw material of political practice in general, via a precise example: the political practice of a Marxist leader in 1917.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Thus conceived, Lenin's analysis is a practical response (his analysis is this response in a practical state) to the general theoretical question: what is political practice? what distinguishes it from other practices? or, if you prefer a more classical formulation: what is political action? Through Lenin, and against the speculative thesis (a Hegelian thesis, but one that Hegel inherited from an older ideology since it is already supreme in Bossuet) which regards the concrete of a political situation as 'the contingency' in which 'necessity is realized', we come to the beginning of a theoretical answer to this real question. We can see that the object of Lenin's political practice is obviously not Universal History, nor even the general History of Imperialism. The History of Imperialism is certainly at issue in his practice, but it does not constitute its particular object. The History of Imperialism as such is the particular object of other activities: the activity of the Marxist theoretician or of the Marxist historian -- but in such cases it is the object of a theoretical practice. Lenin meets Imperialism in his political practice in the modality of a <I>current</I> existence: in a concrete present. The theoretician of history or the historian meet it in another modality, the modality of non-currency and abstraction. So the particular object of political practice does belong to the history which is also discussed by the theoretician and the historian; but it is <I>another</I> object. Lenin knew perfectly well that he was acting on a social present which was the product of the development of imperialism, otherwise he would not have been a Marxist, but in 1917 he was not acting on Imperialism in general; he was acting on the concrete of the Russian situation, of the Russian conjuncture, on what he gave the remarkable name, 'the current situation', the situation whose currency defined his political practice as such. In the world that a historian of Imperialism is forced to see in section, if he wants to see it as Lenin lived it and understood it -- because it was, as the existing world is, the sole concrete world in existence, in the sole concrete possible, the concrete of its currency, in the 'current situation' -- Lenin analysed what constituted the characteristics of its structure: the essential articulations, the interconnexions, the strategic nodes on which the possibility and the fate of any revolutionary practice depended; the disposition and relations typical of the contradictions in a determinate country (semi-feudal and semi-colonialist, and yet imperialist) in the period 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 179</B></FONT><P>

in which the principal contradiction was approaching explosion. This is what is irreplaceable in Lenin's texts: the analysis of the structure of a <I>conjuncture</I>, the displacements and condensations of its contradictions and their paradoxical unity, all of which are the very existence of that 'current situation' which political action was to transform, in the strongest sense of the word, between February and October, 1917. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And if anyone opposes or offers these texts the irreproachable lesson of a long-term historical analysis<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp179">14</A>]</FONT> in which Lenin's 'current situation' is no more than an instant absorbed in a process which began long before it and which will supersede it in the realization of its own future -- one of those historical analyses in which imperialism explains everything, which is true, but in which the unfortunate Lenin, struggling with the problems and analyses of revolutionary practice, is usually literally overtaken, swept off his feet and carried away by the avalanche of historical proof -- then that person will never make any headway with them. As if Lenin did not regard Imperialism as precisely such and such current contradictions, their current structure and relations, as if this structured currency did not constitute the sole object of his political action! As if a single word could thus magically dissolve the reality of an irreplaceable practice, the revolutionaries' practice their lives, their sufferings, their sacrifices, their efforts, in short their concrete history, by the use made of another practice, based on the first, the practice of a historian -- that is, of a scientist, who necessarily reflects on necessity's <I>fait accompli </I>; as if the theoretical practice of a classical historian who analyses the past could be confused with the practice of a revolutionary leader who reflects on the present in the present, on the necessity to be achieved, on the means to produce it, on the strategic application points for these means; in short, on his own action, for <I>he</I> does act on concrete history! and his mistakes and successes do not just feature between the covers of a <I>written</I>, 8vo 'history' in the <I>Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale </I>; their names will always be remembered, in concrete life: 1905, 1914, 1917, Hitler, Franco, Stalingrad, China, Cuba. To distinguish between the two practices, this is the heart of the question. For Lenin knew better than anyone else that the contradictions he analysed arose from one and the same Imperialism, the

Imperialism that even produced their paradoxes. But knowing this, he was concerned with something else in them than this general historical knowledge, and it was because a tested science had taught him the latter that he could really concern himself with something else, with what it was that constituted the structure of his practical object: with the typicality of the contradictions, with their displacements, their condensations and the 'fusion' in revolutionary rupture that they produced; in short, with the 'current situation' that they constituted. That is why the theory of the 'weakest link' is identical with the theory of the 'decisive link'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Once we have realized this we can return to Lenin with a quiet mind. However much any ideologue tries to bury him beneath a proof by historical analysis, there is always this one man standing there in the plain of History and of our lives, in the eternal 'current situation'. He goes on talking, calmly or passionately. He goes on talking to us about something quite simple: about his revolutionary practice, about the practice of the class struggle, in other words, about what makes it possible to act on History from within the sole history present, about what is specific in the contradiction and in the dialectic, about the specific difference of the contradiction which quite simply allows us, not to demonstrate or explain the 'inevitable' revolutions <I>post festum</I>, but to 'make' them in our unique present, or, as Marx profoundly formulated it,<FONT SIZE=-2>[15]</FONT> to make the dialectic into a revolutionary method, rather than the theory of the <I>fait accompli.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[16]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To sum up, the problem posed -- what constitutes Marx's 'inversion' of the Hegelian dialectic? what is the specific difference which distinguishes the Marxist dialectic from the Hegelian? -- has already been resolved by Marxist practice, whether this is Marx's theoretical practice or the political practice of the class struggle. So its solution does exist, in the works of Marxism, but only in a practical state. We have to express it in its theoretical form, that is, to move from what, in most of the 'famous quota-

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This distinction should keep us clear of one last blind alley. It would be very easy -- and is therefore tempting -- to take the recognition of the existence of an object for the <I>knowledge</I> of it. Because of this facility, I might have found part or the whole of the list of 'famous quotations' used against me as a total argument, or as the equivalent of a theoretical argument. However, these quotations are precious because they say that the problem exists and that it has been resolved! They say that Marx has resolved it by 'inverting' Hegel's dialectic. But the 'famous quotations' do not give us the theoretical knowledge of this inversion. And the proof of this is, as clear as day, that we have to make a very serious theoretical effort if we are to succeed in thinking this inversion which seems so obvious. Indeed, too many of the 'explanations' that we have been given have restricted themselves to repeating the 'famous quotations' in paraphrase (but a paraphrase is not an explanation); to mingling the (gestural but enigmatic) concepts of 'inversion', 'rational kernel' with authentic and rigorous Marxist concepts, as if the theoretical clarity of the latter could illuminate the obscurity of the former by contagion, as if knowledge could be born merely of the cohabitation of the known and the little known or unknown,<FONT SIZE=-2>[18]</FONT> as if the contiguity of one or two scientific concepts was enough to transfigure our recognition of the existence of the 'inversion' or the 'kernel' into the knowledge of them! It would be more honest to take full responsibility for one's position, for example, to declare that Marx's remark about the 'inversion' is a <I>true knowledge</I>, to take that risk, and put the thesis to the test of theoretical practice -- and to examine the results. Such a trial is interesting since it is a real experiment and because it leads to a <I>reductio ad absurdum</I>, demonstrating that Marx's thought would be profoundly weakened

A reflection on this use is enough to draw from it the basic elements of a Dialectics, since this use is nothing more nor less than the Dialectics in a practical state. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I said that Lenin left us no <I>Dialectics</I> that would be the theoretical expression of the dialectic in action in his own political practice; more generally, that the theoretical labour of expressing the dialectic in action in the Marxist practice of the class struggle had still to be performed.

   I hope to be able to show how we can find in these texts -- in a form which has already been considerably elaborated and which it is only necessary to develop, to relate to its basis and to reflect on continually -- the theoretical answer to our question: what is the specificity of the Marxist dialectic?

Mao Tse-tung begins with contradiction in its 'universality', but his only serious discussion centres around the contradiction in the practice of the class struggle, by virtue of another 'universal' principle, the principle that the universal only exists in the particular, a principle which Mao reflects, <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> contradiction, in the following universal form: contradiction is always specific and specificity universally appertains to its essence. We may be tempted to smile at this preliminary 'labour' of the universal, which seems to need a supplement of universality if it is to give birth to specificity, and to regard this 'labour' as the labour of the Hegelian 'negativity'. But a real understanding of materialism reveals that this 'labour' is not a labour of the universal, but a labour <I>on</I> a pre-existing universal, a labour whose aim and achievement is precisely to refuse this universal the abstractions or the temptations of 'philosophy' (ideology), and to bring it back to its condition by force; to the condition of a scientifically specified universality. If the universal has to be this specificity, we have no right to invoke a universal which is not the universal of this specificity. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This point is essential to dialectical materialism, and Marx discusses an illustration of it in the <I>Introduction</I> when he demonstrates that although the use of general concepts -- for example, 'production', 'labour', 'exchange', etc. -- is indispensable to a scientific theoretical practice, this first generality does not coincide with the product of the scientific labour: it is not its achievement, it is its prior condition. This first generality (which I shall call <I>Generality I </I>) constitutes the raw material that the science's theoretical practice will transform into specified 'concepts', that is, into that other 'concrete' generality (which I shall call <I>Generality III </I>) which is a knowledge. But what, then, is Generality I, that is, the raw material on which the labour of science is expended? Contrary to the ideological illusions -- illusions which are not 'na&iuml;ve', not mere 'aberrations', but necessary and well-founded as ideologies -- of empiricism or sensualism, a science never works on an 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 184</B></FONT><P>

existence whose essence is pure immediacy and singularity ('sensations' or 'individuals'). It always works on something 'general', even if this has the form of a 'fact'. At its moment of constitution, as for physics with Galileo and for the science of the evolution of social formations (historical materialism) with Marx, a science always works on existing concepts, '<I>Vorstellungen </I>', that is, a preliminary Generality I of an ideological nature. It does not 'work' on a purely objective 'given', that of pure and absolute 'facts'. On the contrary, its particular labour consists of <I>elaborating its own scientific facts</I> through a critique of the <I>ideological</I> '<I>facts </I>' elaborated by an earlier ideological theoretical practice. To elaborate its own specific 'facts' is simultaneously to elaborate its own 'theory', since a scientific fact -- and not the self-styled pure phenomenon -- can only be identified in the field of a theoretical practice. In the development of an already constituted science, the latter works on a raw material (Generality I) constituted either of still ideological concepts, or of scientific 'facts', or of already scientifically elaborated concepts which belong nevertheless to an earlier phase of the science (an ex-Generality III). So it is by transforming this Generality I into a Generality III (knowledge) that the science works and produces.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But <I>who</I> or <I>what</I> is it that works? What should we understand by the expression: the science works? As we have seen, every transformation (every practice) presupposes the transformation of a raw material into products by setting in motion determinate means of production. What is the moment, the level or the instance which corresponds to the means of production, in the theoretical practice of science? If we abstract from men in these means of production for the time being, it is what I shall call the <I>Generality II</I>, constituted by the corpus of concepts whose more or less contradictory unity constitutes the 'theory' of the science at the (historical) moment under consideration,<FONT SIZE=-2>[21]</FONT> the 'theory' that defines 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
21. This Generality II, designated by the concept of 'theory', obviously deserves a much more serious examination than I can embark on here. Let us simply say that the unity I am calling 'theory' rarely exists in a science in the reflected form of a unified theoretical system. In the experimental sciences at least, besides concepts in their purely theoretical existence, it includes the whole field of technique, in which the theoretical concepts are in large part invested. The explicitly theoretical part proper is very rarely [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 185. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] unified in a non-contradictory form. Usually it is made up of regions locally unified in regional theories that coexist in a complex and contradictory whole with a theoretically unreflected unity. This is the extremely complex and contradictory unity which is in action, in each case according to a specific mode, in the labour of theoretical production of each science. For example, in the experimental sciences, this is what constitutes the 'phenomena' into 'facts', this is what poses an existing difficulty in the form of problem, and 'resolves' this problem by locating the theoretico-technical dispositions which make up the real corpus of what an idealist tradition calls 'hypotheses', etc. etc. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 185</B></FONT><P>

the field in which all the problems of the science must necessarily be posed (that is, where the 'difficulties' met by the science in its object, in the confrontation of its 'facts' and its 'theory', of its previous 'knowledges' and its 'theory', or of its 'theory' and its new knowledges, will be posed in the form of a problem by and in this field). We must rest content with these schematic gestures and not enter into the dialectic of this theoretical labour. They will suffice for an understanding of the fact that theoretical practice produces <I>Generalities III</I> by the work of <I>Generality II</I> on <I>Generality I.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So they will suffice for an understanding of the two following important propositions: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (1) There is never an identity of essence between Generality I and Generality III, but always a real transformation, either by the transformation of an ideological generality into a scientific generality (a mutation which is reflected in the form Bachelard, for example, calls an 'epistemological break'); or by the production of a new scientific generality which rejects the old one even as it 'englobes' it, that is, defines its 'relativity' and the (subordinate) limits of its validity. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (2) The work whereby Generality I becomes Generality III, that is -- abstracting from the essential differences that distinguish Generality I and Generality III -- whereby the 'abstract' becomes the 'concrete', only involves the process of theoretical practice, that is, it all takes place 'within knowledge'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Marx is expressing this second proposition when he declares that 'the correct scientific method' is to start with the abstract to produce the concrete in thought.<FONT SIZE=-2>[22]</FONT> We must grasp the precise 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
22. Cf. Marx, <I>Introduction </I>: 'It would appear to be correct to start with the real and concrete. . . . However, a closer look reveals that this is false. . . . [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 186. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] The latter (the method of those economic systems which move from general notions to concrete ones) is decidedly the correct scientific method. The concrete is concrete because it is the synthesis of many determinations, and therefore a unity of diversity. That is why it appears in thought as a process of synthesis, as a result, not as a point of departure . . . (in scientific method) abstract determinations lead to the reproduction of the concrete via the path of thought . . . the method which consists of rising from the abstract to the concrete is merely the way thought appropriates the concrete and reproduces it as a concrete in thought' (Marx-Engels, <I>Werke</I>, Berlin, Vol. XIII, pp. 631-2).

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 186</B></FONT><P>

meaning of this thesis if we are not to slide into the ideological illusions with which these very words are only too often associated, that is, if we are not to believe that the <I>abstract</I> designates theory itself (science) while the <I>concrete</I> designates the real, the 'concrete' realities, knowledge of which is produced by theoretical practice; if we are to confuse <I>two different concretes </I>: the <I>concrete-in-thought</I> which is a knowledge, and the <I>concrete-reality</I> which is its object. The process that produces the concrete-knowledge takes place wholly in the theoretical practice: of course, it does concern the concrete-real, but this concrete-real 'survives in its independence after as before, outside thought' (Marx), without it ever being possible to confuse it with that other 'concrete' which is the knowledge of it. That the concrete-in-thought (Generality III) under consideration is the knowledge of its object (the concrete-real) is only a 'difficulty' for the ideology which transforms this reality into a so-called 'problem' (the Problem of Knowledge), and which therefore thinks as problematic what has been produced precisely as a non-problematic solution to a real problem by scientific practice itself: the non-problematicity of the relation between an object and the knowledge of it. So it is essential that we do not confuse the real distinction between the abstract (Generality and the concrete (Generality III) which affects theoretical practice only, with another, ideological, distinction which opposes abstraction (which constitutes the essence of thought, science and theory) to the concrete (which constitutes the essence of the real). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This is precisely Feuerbach's confusion; a confusion shared by Marx in his Feuerbachian period: not only does it provide ammunition for a mass-produced ideology popular today, but it also 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 187</B></FONT><P>

threatens to lead astray those taken in by the 'transparency' of its often considerable virtues as a protest, into hopeless theoretical blind-alleys. The critique which, in the last instance, counterposes the abstraction it attributes to theory and to science and the concrete it regards as the real itself, remains an ideological critique, since it denies the reality of scientific practice, the validity of its abstractions and ultimately the reality of that theoretical 'concrete' which is a knowledge. Hoping to be 'concrete' and hoping for the 'concrete', this conception hopes to be 'true' <I>qua</I> conception, so it hopes to be knowledge, but it starts by denying the reality of precisely the practice that produces knowledge! It remains in the very ideology that it claims to 'invert', that is, not in abstraction in general, but in a determinate ideological abstraction.<FONT SIZE=-2>[23]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It was absolutely necessary to come this far if we were to recognize that even within the process of knowledge, the 'abstract' generality with which the process starts and the 'concrete' generality it finishes with, Generality I and Generality III respectively, are not in essence the same generality, and, in consequence, the 'appearance' of the Hegelian conception of the autogenesis of the concept, of the 'dialectical' movement whereby the abstract universal produces itself as concrete, depends on a confusion of the kinds of 'abstraction' or 'generality' in action in theoretical prac-

23. Feuerbach himself is an example. That is why his 'declarations of materialism' should be handled with great care. I have already drawn attention to this point (cf. <I>La Pens&eacute;e</I>, March-April 1961, p. 8), in an article on the Young Marx in which I even used <I>certain notions that remained ideological</I>, notions that would fall under the ban of this present criticism. For example, the concept of a 'retreat' which acted as a reply to Hegel's 'supersession' and was intended to illustrate Marx's effort to get out of ideology to free himself from myth and make contact with the <I>original</I> which Hegel had deformed -- even used polemically, this concept of a 'retreat', by suggesting a return to the 'real', to the 'concrete' <I>anterior</I> to ideology, came within a handsbreadth of 'positivism'. Or again, the polemical refutation of even the <I>possibility</I> of a history of philosophy. The authority for this thesis came from a quotation from <I>The German Ideology</I> which does declare that philosophy (like religion, art, etc.) has no history. There also I was on the edge of positivism, only a step from reducing all ideology (and therefore philosophy) to a simple (temporary) phenomenon of a social formation (as <I>The German Ideology</I> is constantly tempted to do).

tice. Thus, when Hegel, as Marx puts it,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp188">24</A>]</FONT> conceives' the real as the result of self-synthesizing, self-deepening and self-moving thought' he is the victim of a <I>double</I> confusion:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (1) First, he takes the labour of production of scientific knowledge for 'the genetic process of the concrete (the real) itself'. But Hegel could not fall into this 'illusion' without opening himself: to a second confusion.
                   
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (2) He takes the universal concept that figures at the beginning of the process of knowledge (for example, the concept of universality itself, the concept of 'Being' in the <I>Logic </I>) for the essence and motor of the process, for 'the self-engendering concept',<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp188">25</A>]</FONT> he takes the Generality I which theoretical practice is to transform into a knowledge (Generality III) for the essence and motor of the transformation process itself! Legitimately borrowing an analogy from another practice,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp188">26</A>]</FONT> we might just as well claim that it is the fuel that by its dialectical auto-development produces the steam-engine, the factories and all the extraordinary technical, mechanical, physical, chemical and electrical apparatus which makes its extraction and its innumerable transformations possible today! So Hegel only falls victim to this 'illusion' because he imposes on the reality of theoretical practice an ideological conception of the universal, of its function and meaning. But in the dialectic of practice, the abstract generality at the beginning (Generality I), that is, the generality worked on, is not the same as the generality that does the work (Generality II) and even less is it the specific generality (Generality III) produced by this labour: a knowledge (the 'concrete-theoretical'). Generality II (which works) is not at all the simple development of Generality I, its passage (however complex) from the in-itself to the for-itself, for Generality II is the 'theory' of the science under consideration, and as such it is the result of a whole process (the history of the science from its foundation), which is a process of real transformations in the strongest sense of the word, that is, a process whose form is not the form of a simple development (according to the Hegelian model -- the development of the in-itself into the for-itself), but of mutations

and reconstructions that induce real qualitative discontinuities. So when Generality II works on Generality I it is never working on itself, neither at the moment of the science's foundation nor later in its history. That is why Generality I always emerges from this labour really transformed. It may retain the general 'form' of generality, but this form tells us nothing about it, for it has become a quite different generality -- it is no longer an ideological generality, nor one belonging to an earlier phase of the science, but in every case a qualitatively new specified scientific generality. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Hegel denies this reality of theoretical practice, this concrete dialectic of theoretical practice, that is, the qualitative discontinuity that intervenes or appears between the different generalities (I, II and III) even in the continuity of the production process of knowledges, or rather, he does not think of it, and if he should happen to think of it, he makes it the phenomenon of another reality, the reality he regards as essential, but which is really ideological through and through: the movement of the Idea. He projects this movement on to the reality of scientific labour, ultimately conceiving the unity of the process from the abstract to the concrete as the auto-genesis of the concept, that is, as a simple development via the very forms of alienation of the original in-itself in the emergence of its end-result, an end-result which is no more than its beginning. That is why Hegel fails to see the real, qualitative differences and transformations, the essential discontinuities which constitute the very process of theoretical practice. He imposes an ideological model on them, the model of the development of a simple interiority. That is to say, Hegel decrees that the ideological generality he imposes on them shall be the sole constitutive essence of the three types of generality -- I, II and III -- in action in theoretical practice. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Only now does the profound meaning of the Marxist critique of Hegel begin to appear in all its implications. Hegel's basic flaw is not just a matter of the 'speculative' illusion. This speculative illusion had already been denounced by Feuerbach and it consists of the identification of thought and being, of the process of thought and the process of being, of the concrete 'in thought' and the 'real' concrete This is the speculative sin <I>par excellence </I>: the sin of abstraction which inverts the order of things and puts the process of the auto-genesis of the concept (the abstract) in the 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 190</B></FONT><P>

place of the process of the auto-genesis of the concrete (the real). Marx explains this to us quite clearly in <I>The Holy Family </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp190">27</A>]</FONT> where we see, in Hegelian speculative philosophy, the abstraction 'Fruit' produce the apple, the pear and the almond by its own movement of auto-determinant auto-genesis. . . . Feuerbach gave what was if possible an even better exposition and criticism of it in his admirable 1839 analysis of the Hegelian 'concrete universal'. Thus, there is a <I>bad</I> use of abstraction (the speculative and idealist use) which reveals to us the contrasting <I>good</I> use of abstraction (the materialist use). We understand, it is all quite clear and straightforward! And we prepare to put things straight, that is, to put abstraction in its right place by a liberating 'inversion' -- for, of course, it is not the (general) concept of fruit which produces (concrete) fruits by auto-development, but, on the contrary, (concrete) fruits which produce the (abstract) concept of fruit. Is that all right?

   No, strictly speaking, it is not all right. We cannot accept the ideological confusions which are implicit in this 'inversion' and which allow us to talk about it in the first place. There is no rigour in the inversion in question, unless we presuppose a basic ideological confusion, the confusion Marx had to reject when he really renounced Feuerbach and stopped invoking his vocabulary, when he had consciously abandoned the empiricist ideology which had allowed him to maintain that a scientific concept is produced exactly as the general concept of fruit 'should be' produced, by an abstraction acting on concrete fruits. When Marx says in the <I>Introduction</I> that any process of scientific knowledge begins from the abstract, from a generality, and not from the real concrete, he demonstrates the fact that he has actually broken with ideology and with the mere denunciation of speculative abstraction, that is, with its presuppositions. When Marx declares that the raw material of a science always exists in the form of a given generality (Generality I), in this thesis with the simplicity of a fact he is putting before us a new model which no longer has any relation to the empiricist model of the production of a concept by good abstraction, starting from real fruits and disengaging their essence by 'abstracting from their individuality'. This is now clear as far as the scientific labour is concerned; its starting-point is not 'concrete subjects' but

Generalities I. But is this also true of this <I>Generality I </I>? Surely the latter is a preliminary stage of knowledge produced precisely by the <I>good abstraction</I> that Hegelian speculation merely uses in a bad way? Unfortunately, this thesis cannot be an organic part of dialectical materialism, but only of an empiricist and sensualist ideology. This is the thesis Marx rejects when he condemns Feuerbach for conceiving 'sensuousness . . . only in the form of the object', that is, only in the form of an intuition without practice. Generality I, for example, the concept of 'fruit', is not the product of an 'operation of abstraction' performed by a 'subject' (consciousness, or even that mythological subject 'practice') -- but the result of a complex process of elaboration which involves several distinct concrete practices on different levels, empirical, technical and ideological. (To return to our rudimentary example, the concept of fruit is itself the product of distinct practices, dietary, agricultural or even magical, religious and ideological practices -- in its origins.) So as long as knowledge has not broken with ideology, every Generality I will be deeply impregnated by ideology, which is one of the basic practices essential to the existence of the social whole. The act of <I>abstraction</I> whereby the pure essence is extracted from concrete individuals <I>is an ideological myth.</I> In essence, Generality I is inadequate to the essence of the objects from which abstraction should extract it. It is this inadequacy that theoretical practice reveals and removes by the transformation of Generality I into Generality III. So Generality I itself is a rejection of the model from empiricist ideology presupposed by the 'inversion'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To sum up: if we recognize that scientific practice starts with the abstract and produces a (concrete) knowledge, we must also recognize that Generality I, the raw material of theoretical practice, is qualitatively different from Generality II, which transforms it into 'concrete-in-thought', that is, into knowledge (Generality III). Denial of the difference distinguishing these two types of Generality and ignorance of the priority of Generality II (which works) over Generality I (which is worked on), are <I>the very bases of the Hegelian idealism</I> that Marx rejected: behind the still ideological semblance of the 'inversion' of abstract speculation to give concrete reality or science, this is the decisive point in which the fate of Hegelian ideology and Marxist theory is decided. The fate 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 192</B></FONT><P>

of Marxist theory, because we all know that the deep reasons for a rupture -- not the reasons we admit, but those that act -- will decide for ever whether the deliverance we expect from it will be only the expectation of freedom, that is, the absence of freedom, or freedom itself. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So that is why to maintain that the concept of 'inversion' is a <I>knowledge</I> is to endorse the ideology that underlies it, that is, to endorse a conception that denies even the reality of theoretical practice. The 'settlement' pointed out to us by the concept of 'inversion' cannot then consist merely of an inversion of the theory which conceives the auto-genesis of the concept as 'the genesis of the (real) concrete' itself, to give the opposite theory, the theory which conceives the auto-genesis of the real as the genesis of the concept (it is this opposition that, if it really had any basis, would authorize the term 'inversion'): this settlement consists (and this is the decisive point) of the rejection of an ideological theory foreign to the reality of scientific practice, to substitute for it a qualitatively different theory which, for its part, recognizes the essence of scientific practice, distinguishes it from the ideology that some have wanted to impose on it, takes seriously its particular characteristics, thinks them, expresses them, and thinks and expresses the practical conditions even of this recognition.<FONT SIZE=-2>[28]</FONT> On reaching this point, we can see that in the last resort there can be no question of an 'inversion'. For a science is not obtained by inverting an ideology. A science is obtained on condition that the domain in which ideology believes that it is dealing with the real is abandoned, that is, by

28. This work of rupture was the result of one man's theoretical practice; that man was Karl Marx. This is not the place to return to a question I merely outlined in my article <I><A HREF="http://marx2mao.phpwebhosting.com/Other/FM65i#s1">On the Young Marx</A>.</I> I should have to show why it is that Marx's theoretical practice, itself also a labour of transformation, should necessarily have taken on in theory the preponderant form of a rupture, of an epistemological break. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   Might I suggest that the moment that Marx's relation to Hegel is no longer, in the last analysis, a relation of inversion, but a quite different relation, we may perhaps be better able to understand what seemed so prodigious and paradoxical to Lenin himself (in his immediate reactions of surprise in the <I>Notebooks </I>): that there are in Hegel utilizable analyses and even a number of -- naturally -- isolated demonstrations of a materialist character? Might I suggest that, if the relation between Marx and Hegel is not one of inversion, the 'rationality' of the Hegelian dialectic becomes infinitely more intelligible?

We seem to have come a long way from the specificity of every contradiction -- but, in fact, we have not moved one inch from it. We now know that this specificity is not the specification of any generality whatsoever, that is, in the limit case, the specification of an ideological generality. It is the specificity of a Generality III, of a knowledge. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What, then, is this 'specificity' of contradiction? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The dialectic is 'the study of contradiction in the very essence of objects', or what comes to the same thing, 'the doctrine of the unity of opposites'. According to Lenin, 'this grasps the kernel of

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
30. This sort of challenge will, I think, raise some echoes in all Marxists' political experience. For to defy anyone to make a real change in the effects without changing the cause, the basic determining structure, surely resembles the critique of reformism, the challenge that Communists throw down every day to all the world's reformists, to all those who believe that it is possible to invert the order of things on its own basis, for example, to invert social inequality into social equality, the exploitation of man by man into the mutual co-operation of men, on the very basis of existing social relations. The workers' song says: '<I>le monde va changer de base </I>'; it is theoretically irreproachable.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 194</B></FONT><P>

dialectics, but it requires explanations and development'. Mao refers to these texts and moves on to the 'explanations and development', that is, to the content of the 'kernel', in short, to the definition of the specificity of contradictions. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And then we suddenly come upon three very remarkable concepts. Two are concepts of distinction: (1) the distinction between the <I>principal contradiction</I> and the secondary contradictions, (2) the distinction between the <I>principal aspect</I> and the secondary <I>aspect</I> of each contradiction. The third and last concept: (3) the <I>uneven development</I> of contradiction. These concepts are presented to us as if 'that's how it is'. We are told that they are essential to the Marxist dialectic, since they are what is specific about it. It is up to us to seek out the deeper theoretical reasons behind these claims. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Mere consideration of the first distinction is enough to show that it presupposes immediately the existence of several contradictions (if not it would be impossible to oppose the principal ones to the secondary ones) in the same process. So it implies the existence of a complex process. In fact, according to Mao, 'A simple process contains only a single pair of opposites, while a complex process contains more'; for 'there are many contradictions in the course of development of any major thing'; but then, 'there are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[31]</FONT> As the second distinction (the distinction between the principal and secondary aspects of each contradiction) merely reflects within each contradiction the complexity of the process, that is, the existence in it of a plurality of contradictions, one of which is dominant, it is this complexity that we must consider. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We have found the complexity of the process at the heart of these basic distinctions. Here again we are touching on one of the essential points of Marxism: the same essential point, but approached from another angle. When Mao sets aside the 'simple process with two opposites', he seems to do so for factual reasons; it is irrelevant to his object, society, which does have a plurality of contradictions. But at the same time, surely, he provides for the pure possibility of this 'simple process with two opposites'?

If so, it could be argued that this 'simple process with two opposites' is the essential, original process, and the others, the complex processes, are no more than complications of it, that is, the phenomenon developed. Is not Lenin leaning towards this view when he declares that 'The splitting of a single whole and the knowledge of its contradictory parts', already known to Philo . . . (Lenin's parenthesis), 'is the <I>essence</I> (one of the "essentials", one of the principal, if not the principal, characteristics or features) of the dialectic'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp195">32</A>]</FONT> In the single whole split into two contradictory parts, Lenin is surely not just describing a 'model' of contradiction, but the very 'womb' of all contradiction, the original essence manifest in all contradiction, even in its most complex forms? And this would surely make the complex merely the development and phenomenon of the simple? This is the decisive question. For this 'simple process with two opposites' in which the Whole is split into two contradictory parts is precisely the very <I>womb</I> of Hegelian contradiction. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Once again, we can and must put our interpretation to the test. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Of course, Mao only refers to the 'simple process' as a reminder, and gives no example of it. But throughout his analysis we never deal with anything but complex processes in which a structure with multiple and uneven determinations intervenes primitively, not secondarily; no complex process is presented as the development of a simple one, so the complex never appears as the phenomenon of the simple -- on the contrary, it appears as the result of a process which is itself complex. So complex processes are never anything but given complexities, their reduction to simple origins is never envisaged, in fact or in principle. If we return to Marx's 1857 <I>Introduction</I>, we find the same requirement expressed with extraordinary rigour: in his reflections on the concepts of Political Economy, Marx does not only show that it is impossible to delve down to the birth or origin of the simple universal, 'production', since 'when we talk of production we always mean production at a determinate stage in social development of the production of individuals living in <I>society </I>',<FONT SIZE=-2>[33]</FONT> that is, in a structured social whole. Marx does not only deny us the ability to delve down

beneath this complex whole (and this denial is a denial on principle: it is not ignorance which prevents us, but the very essence of production itself, its concept); Marx does not only show that every 'simple category' presupposes the existence of the structured whole of society,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp196">34</A>]</FONT> but also, what is almost certainly more important, he demonstrates that far from being original, in determinate conditions, simplicity is merely the product of the complex process. This is simplicity's sole claim to existence (again, existence in a complex whole!): in the form of the existence of such and such a 'simple' category. Thus, labour: 'Labour seems a wholly simple category. Even the conception of labour in this generality -- as Labour in general -- is age-old. . . . However, economically conceived in this simplicity, "labour" is as modern a category as the relations which engender this simple abstraction'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp196">35</A>]</FONT> In the same way, the individual producer, or the individual as the elementary subject of production, which eighteenth-century mythology imagined to be at the origin of society's economic development, this economic 'cogito' only appeared, even as an 'appearance', in developed capitalist society, that is, in the society which had developed the social character of production to the highest degree. Similarly, in exchange, the simple universal <I>par excellence</I>, 'did not appear historically in all its intensity until the most developed states of society. (This category) absolutely does not stride through every economic relation'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[36]</FONT> So simplicity is not original; on the contrary, it is the structured whole which gives its meaning to the simple category, or which may produce the economic existence of certain simple categories as the result of a long process and under exceptional conditions. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Whatever the case, we are in a world foreign to Hegel: 'Hegel is right to begin his <I>Philosophy of Right</I> with possession as it is the subject's simplest legal relation. But no possession exists before the family or before master-slave relations, and these are much more concrete relations.<FONT SIZE=-2>[37]</FONT> The <I>Introduction</I> is no more than a long demonstration of the following thesis: the simple only ever exists within a complex structure; the universal existence of a simple

category is never original, it only appears as the end-result of a long historical process, as the product of a highly differentiated social structure; so, where reality is concerned, we are never dealing with the pure existence of simplicity, be it essence or category, but with the existence of 'concretes' of complex and structured beings and processes. This is the basic principle that eternally rejects the Hegelian womb of contradiction. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Indeed, if we take the rigorous essence rather than the metaphorical sense of the Hegelian model, we can see that the latter does require this 'simple process with two opposites', this simple original unity, splitting into two opposites, that is still evoked in Lenin's reference. This is the original unity that constitutes the fragmented unity of the two opposites in which it is alienated, changing even as it stays the same; these two opposites are the same unity, but in duality, the same interiority, but in exteriority  and that is why each is for its own part the contradictory and abstraction of the other, since each is merely the abstraction of the other without knowing it, as in-itself -- before restoring their original unity, but enriched by its fragmentation, by its alienation, in the negation of the abstraction which negated their previous unity; then they will be a single whole once again, they will have reconstituted a new simple 'unity', enriched by the past labour of their negation, the new simple unity of a totality produced by the negation of the negation. It is clear that the implacable logic of this Hegelian model rigorously interlinks the following concepts: simplicity, essence, identity, unity, negation, fission, alienation, opposites, abstraction, negation of the negation, supersession (<I>Aufhebung </I>), totality, simplicity, etc. The whole of the Hegelian dialectic is here, that is, it is completely dependent on the radical presupposition of a simple original unity which develops within itself by virtue of its negativity, and throughout its development only ever restores the original simplicity and unity in an ever more 'concrete' totality. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Marxists may well invoke this model or use it as a short-cut or symbol, either inadvertently or intentionally,<FONT SIZE=-2>[38]</FONT> but strictly

38. Intentionally: for example, when Marx wanted to teach his contemporaries' <I>philosophical stupidity</I> a lesson, by 'coquetting' with Hegel's terminology in the First Volume of <I>Capital</I> ('<I>kokettieren </I>'). Do we still need this lesson?

conceived, Marxist theoretical practice rejects it, just as Marxist political practice does. Marxism rejects it precisely because it rejects the theoretical presupposition of the Hegelian model: the presupposition of an original simple unity. What Marxism refuses is the (ideological) philosophical pretension to coincide exhaustively with a 'root origin', whatever its form (the <I>tabula rasa </I>; the zero point in a process; the state of nature; the concept of the beginning that for example, Hegel sees as being immediately identical with nothingness; the simplicity that, for Hegel once again, is the starting-point -- and restarting-point, indefinitely -- for every process, what restores it to its origin, etc.); it rejects, therefore, the Hegelian philosophical pretension which accepts this original simple unity (reproduced at each moment of the process) which will produce the whole complexity of the process later in its autodevelopment, but without ever getting lost in this complexity itself,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp196">39</A>]</FONT> without ever losing in it either its simplicity or its unity -- since the plurality and the complexity will never be more than its own 'phenomenon', entrusted with the manifestation of its own essence.<FONT SIZE=-2>[40]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Once again, I am afraid that we cannot reduce the rejection of this presupposition to its 'inversion'. This presupposition has not been 'inverted', it has been eliminated; totally eliminated (absolutely! and not in the sense of the <I>Aufhebung</I> that 'preserves' what it eliminates . . .) and replaced by a <I>quite different</I> theoretical presupposition which has nothing to do with the old one. Instead of the ideological myth of a philosophy of origins and its organic concepts, Marxism establishes in principle the recognition of the givenness of the complex structure of any concrete 'object', a structure which governs both the development of the object and the development of the theoretical practice which produces the knowledge of it. There is no longer any original essence, only an

40. To forestall any misunderstanding, I should point out that it is this 'Hegelian dialectic' that reigns in glory over Marx's <I>1844 Manuscripts</I>, and what is more, in an extraordinarily pure and uncompromising state. To round off the demonstration I should add that the Hegelian dialectic in the <I>Manuscripts</I> has been rigorously 'inverted'. That is why the rigour of this rigorous text is not Marxist.
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 199</B></FONT><P>

ever-pre-givenness, however far knowledge delves into its past. There is no longer any simple unity, only a structured, complex unity. There is no longer any original simple unity (in any form whatsoever), but instead, <I>the ever-pre-givenness of a structured complex unity.</I> If this is the case, it is clear that the 'womb' of the Hegelian dialectic has been proscribed and that its organic categories, in so far as they are specific and positively determined, cannot survive it with theoretical status, particularly those categories that 'cash' the theme of the original simple unity, that is, the 'fission' of the single whole, alienation, the abstraction (in the Hegelian sense) that unites the opposites, the negation of the negation, the <I>Aufhebung</I>, etc. Given this, it is not surprising that there is no trace of these organically Hegelian categories either in Marx's 1857 <I>Introduction</I> or in Mao Tse-tung's text of 1937. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Of course, some of these categories might well be invoked in an ideological context (for example, the struggle with D&uuml;hring), or in a general exposition intended to illustrate the meaning of given results; as long as it is on this level of ideological struggle, or of opposition and illustration, these categories can be used with very real results in ideological practice (struggle) and in the general exposition of a conception. But this last 'exposition' (the illustration of the laws of the dialectic by such and such an example) must remain within the zone sanctioned by theoretical practice -- for in itself it does not constitute a true theoretical practice, producing new knowledges. On the other hand, where a true practice is concerned, one which really transforms its object and produces true results (knowledges, a revolution . . .), such as Marx's and Lenin's theoretical and political practice, etc., then the margin of theoretical tolerance in respect to these categories disappears; the categories themselves disappear. Where a true practice, organically constituted and developed over the years, is concerned, and not a simple application without organic effects, an application which makes no changes in its object (for example, to the practice of physics), to its real development; where the practice of a man truly committed to a true practice is concerned, a man of science who applies himself to the constitution and development of a science, or a political man who applies himself to the development of the class struggle -- then there is no longer any question, there can no longer be any question, of imposing on the object even categories which 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 200</B></FONT><P>

are approximately correct. Then those categories which have nothing further to say are silent, or reduced to silence. Thus, in the only Marxist practices which have really been constituted, Hegelian categories have been dead a long time. They are 'absent' categories. No doubt that is why some people have collected together and displayed to every gaze, with the infinite care that is the due of the unique remains of some former age, the <I>two sole sentences </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp200">41</A>]</FONT> to be found in the whole of <I>Capital</I>, that is, in some 2,300 octavo pages in the English edition; no doubt that is why they add force to these two sentences by adding to them another sentence, or rather a phrase, an exclamation, made by Lenin, which assures us very enigmatically that because Hegel went unread, Marx was not understood at all for half a century. But let us return to this simple fact: in the only Marxist practices that have really been constituted, the categories in use or in action are not Hegelian: in action in Marxist practice there are different categories, the categories of the Marxist dialectic.

Today it is official convention to reproach Stalin with having suppressed the laws of the dialectic, and more generally with having turned away from Hegel, the better to establish his dogmatism. At the same time, it is willingly proposed that a certain return to Hegel would be salutary. One day perhaps these declarations will become the object of some proof. In the meanwhile, it seems to me that it would be simpler to recognize that the expulsion of the 'negation of the negation' from the domain of the Marxist dialectic might be evidence of the real theoretical perspicacity of its author.

law of uneven development. For, as Mao puts it in a phrase as clear as the dawn, 'Nothing in this world develops absolutely evenly'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To understand the meaning of this law and its scope -- and, contrary to what is sometimes thought, it does not concern Imperialism alone, but absolutely 'everything in this world' -- we must return to the essential differences of Marxist contradiction which distinguish a principal contradiction in any complex process, and a principal aspect in any contradiction. So far I have only insisted on this 'difference' as an index of the complexity of the whole, arguing that it is absolutely necessary that the whole be complex if one contradiction in it is to dominate the others. Now we must consider this domination, no longer as an index, but in itself, and draw out its implications. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   That one contradiction dominates the others presupposes that the complexity in which it features is a structured unity, and that this structure implies the indicated domination-subordination relations between the contradictions. For the domination of one contradiction over the others cannot, in Marxism, be the result of a contingent distribution of different contradictions in a collection that is regarded as an object. In this complex whole 'containing many contradictions' we cannot 'find' one contradiction that dominates the others as we might 'find' the spectator a head taller than the others in the grandstand at the stadium. Domination is not just an indifferent <I>fact</I>, it is a fact <I>essential</I> to the complexity itself. That is why complexity implies domination as one of its essentials: it is inscribed in its structure. So to claim that this unity is not and cannot be the unity of a simple, original and universal essence is not, as those who dream of that ideological concept foreign to Marxism, 'monism',<FONT SIZE=-2>[42]</FONT> think, to sacrifice unity on the

42. <I>Monism.</I> This is the key concept in the personal conception of Haeckel, the great German biologist and valiant mechanical materialist combattant in the anti-religious and anti-clerical struggle between 1880 and 1910; active propagandist, author of 'popular' works which had a very wide diffusion; creator of the 'League of German Monists'. He held religion to be 'dualist' and counterposed to it 'monism'. As a 'monist' he held that there were not two substances (God and the world, Mind or soul and matter) but one only. Haeckel himself thought that this Unique Substance had two attributes (rather like the Spinozist substance with its two essential attributes) matter and energy. He held that all determinations, whether [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 202. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] material or spiritual, were modes of this Substance, for which he claimed 'Omnipotence'. Plekhanov was to take up this theme of 'monism', and no doubt it had affinities with the mechanistic tendencies Lenin was later to reproach him with. Plekhanov was more consistent than Haeckel; he recognized that modern idealism was also a monism, as it explained everything by a single substance, Spirit. He maintained that Marxism was a materialist monism (cf. Plekhanov: <I>The Development of the Monist View of History </I>). Perhaps it is to Plekhanov that I owe the simultaneous presence of the term 'monism' in the articles of G. Besse, R. Garaudy and G. Mury, and of expressions declaring that Marxism is essentially 'monist'. Engels and Lenin totally condemned this ideological concept because of its imprecision. Sometimes my critics use it in a strong sense (e.g. Mury), sometimes in a more or less weak sense; they do not oppose it to dualism, as Haeckel and Plekhanov did, but to 'pluralism'; so in their hands the term may be said to have taken on a methodological nuance, but still an ideological one. The concept has no positive use in Marxism, it is even theoretically dangerous. At the most, it might have a negative practical value: beware of 'pluralism'! It has no value as knowledge. To accord it such a value and draw out the theoretical consequences (Mury) is ultimately to deform Marx's thought.

altar of 'pluralism' -- it is to claim something quite different: that the unity discussed by Marxism is <I>the unity of the complexity itself</I>, that the mode of organization and articulation of the complexity is precisely what constitutes its unity. It is to claim that <I>the complex whole has the unity of a structure articulated in dominance.</I> In the last resort this specific structure is the basis for the relations of domination between contradictions and between their aspects that Mao described as essential. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This principle must be grasped and intransigently defended if Marxism is not to slip back into the confusions from which it had delivered us, that is, into a type of thought for which only one model of unity exists: the unity of a substance, of an essence or of an act; into the twin confusions of 'mechanistic' materialism and the idealism of consciousness. If we were so precipitate as to assimilate the structured unity of a complex whole to the simple unity of a totality; if the complex whole were taken as purely and simply the development of one <I>single</I> essence or original and simple substance, then at best we would slide back from Marx to Hegel, at worst, from Marx to Haeckel! But to do so would be precisely to sacrifice the specific difference which distinguishes Marx from Hegel: the distance which radically separates the <I>Marxist type of unity</I> from the Hegelian type of unity, or the Marxist totality 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 203</B></FONT><P>

from the Hegelian totality. The concept of the 'totality' is a very popular concept today; no passport is required to cross from Hegel to Marx, from the <I>Gestalt</I> to Sartre, etc., beyond the invocation of one word: 'totality'. The word stays the same, but the concept changes, sometimes radically, from one author to another. Once the concept has been defined this tolerance must cease. In fact, the Hegelian 'totality' is not such a malleable concept as has been imagined, it is a concept that is perfectly defined and individualized by its theoretical role. Similarly, the Marxist totality is also definite and rigorous. All these two 'totalities' have in common is: (1) a word; (2) a certain vague conception of the unity of things; (3) some theoretical enemies. On the other hand, in their essence they are almost unrelated. The <I>Hegelian totality</I> is the alienated development of a simple unity, of a simple principle, itself a moment of the development of the Idea: so, strictly speaking, it is the phenomenon, the self-manifestation of this simple principle which persists in all its manifestations, and therefore even in the alienation which prepares its restoration. Once again, we are not dealing with concepts without consequences. For the unity of a simple essence manifesting itself in its alienation produces this result: that every concrete difference featured in the Hegelian totality, including the 'spheres' visible in this totality (civil society, the State, religion, philosophy, etc.), all these differences are negated as soon as they are affirmed: for they are no more than 'moments' of the simple internal principle of the totality, which fulfils itself by negating the alienated difference that it posed; further, as alienations -- phenomena -- of the simple internal principle, these differences are all equally '<I>indifferent </I>', that is, practically equal beside it, and therefore equal to one another, and that is why one determinate contradiction <I>can never be dominant</I> in Hegel.<FONT SIZE=-2>[43]</FONT> That is to say, the Hegelian whole has a 'spiritual'

43. Hegel's theory should not be confused with Marx's judgement of Hegel. Surprising as it may seem to those who know Hegel only in Marx's judgement, in his theory of society Hegel is not the inverse of Marx. The 'spiritual' principle that constitutes the internal unity of the Hegelian historical totality cannot be assimilated at all to the one that features in Marx in the form of the 'determination in the last instance by the Economy'. The inverse principle -- determination in the last instance by the State, or by Philosophy -- is not to be found in Hegel. It was Marx who said that the Hegelian conception of society <I>amounts in reality</I> to making Ideology the [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 204. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] motor of History, because it is an ideological conception. But Hegel says nothing of the kind. For him, there is no determination in the last instance <I>in society</I>, in the existing totality. Hegelian society is not unified by a basic instance that exists inside it, it is neither unified nor determined by any of its 'spheres', be it the political sphere, the philosophical sphere or the religious sphere. For Hegel, the principle unifying and determining the social totality is not such and such a 'sphere' of society but a principle which has no privileged place or body in society, for the simple reason that it resides in all places and all bodies. It is in every determination of society, in the economic, the political, the legal, etc., down to the most spiritual. For example, Rome: it is not its <I>ideology</I> that unifies and determines it for Hegel, but a 'spiritual' principle (itself a moment of the development of the Idea) manifest in every Roman determination, in its economy, its politics, its religion, its law, etc. This principle is <I>the abstract legal personality.</I> It is a 'spiritual' principle of which Roman Law is only one determination among others. In the modern world it is <I>subjectivity</I>, just as universal a principle: the economy is subjectivity, as is politics, religion, philosophy, music, etc. The totality of Hegelian society is such that its principle is simultaneously immanent to it and transcendent of it, but it never coincides in itself with any determinate reality of society itself. That is why the Hegelian totality may be said to be endowed with a unity of a 'spiritual' type in which each element is <I>pars totalis</I>, and in which the visible spheres are merely the alienated and restored unfolding of the said internal principle. In other words, there is nothing to justify the identification (even as an inversion) of the Hegelian totality's type of unity and the Marxist totality's type of unity.
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 204</B></FONT><P>

type of unity in which all the differences are only posed to be negated, that is, they are indifferent, in which they never exist for themselves, in which they only have a semblance of an independent existence, and in which, since they never manifest anything but the unity of the simple internal principle alienated in them, they are practically equal among themselves as the alienated phenomena of this principle. My claim is that the Hegelian totality: (1) is not really, but only apparently, articulated in 'spheres'; (2) that its unity is not its complexity itself, that is, the structure of this complexity; (3) that it is therefore deprived of the structure in dominance (<I>structure &agrave; dominante </I>) which is the absolute precondition for a real complexity to be a unity and really the object of a <I>practice</I> that proposes to transform this structure: political practice. It is no accident that the Hegelian theory of the social totality has never provided the basis for a <I>policy</I>, that there is not and cannot be a Hegelian politics.

   This is not all. If every contradiction is a contradiction in a 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 205</B></FONT><P>

complex whole structured in dominance, this complex whole cannot be envisaged without its contradictions, without their basically uneven relations. In other words, each contradiction, each essential articulation of the structure, and the general relation of the articulations in the structure in dominance, constitute so many conditions of the existence of the complex whole itself. This proposition is of the first importance. For it means that the structure of the whole and therefore the 'difference' of the essential contradictions and their structure in dominance, is the very existence of the whole; that the 'difference' of the contradictions (that there is a principal contradiction, etc.; and that every contradiction has a principal aspect) is identical to the conditions of the existence of the complex whole. In plain terms this position implies that the 'secondary' contradictions are not the pure phenomena of the 'principal' contradiction, that the principal is not the essence and the secondaries so many of its phenomena, so much so that the principal contradiction might practically exist <I>without</I> the secondary contradictions, or without some of them, or might exist <I>before</I> or <I>after</I> them.<FONT SIZE=-2>[44]</FONT> On the contrary, it implies that the secondary contradictions are essential even to the existence of the principal contradiction, that they really constitute its condition of existence, just as the principal contradiction constitutes their condition of existence. As an example, take the complex structured whole that is society. In it, the 'relations of production' are not the pure phenomena of the forces of production; they are also their condition of existence. The superstructure is not the pure phenomenon of the structure, it is also its condition of existence. This follows from Marx's principle, referred to above, that production without society, that is, without social relations, exists nowhere; that we can go no deeper than the unity that is the unity of a whole in which, if the relations of production do have production itself as their condition of existence, production has as its condition of existence its form: the relations of production. Please do not misunderstand me: this mutual conditioning of the existence of the 'contradictions' does not nullify the structure in dominance

44. This myth of origin is well illustrated by the theory of the 'bourgeois' social contract, which, for example, in Locke, and what a theoretical gem, defines an economic activity in the state of nature before (in principle or in fact, it matters little) any of its legal and political conditions of existence!

that reigns over the contradictions and in them (in this case, determination in the last instance by the economy). Despite its apparent circularity, this conditioning does not result in the destruction of the structure of domination that constitutes the complexity of the whole, and its unity. Quite the contrary, even within the reality of the conditions of existence of each contradiction, it is the manifestation of the structure in dominance that unifies the whole.<FONT SIZE=-2>[45]</FONT> <I>This reflection of the conditions of existence of the contradiction within itself</I>, <I>this reflection of the structure articulated in dominance that constitutes the unity of the complex whole within each contradiction</I>, this is the most profound characteristic of the Marxist dialectic, the one I have tried recently to encapsulate in the concept of '<I>overdetermination </I>'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[46]</FONT>

   This becomes easier to understand if we make a detour via a familiar concept. When Lenin said that '<I>the soul of Marxism is the concrete analysis of a concrete situation </I>': when Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao explain that '<I>everything depends on the conditions </I>'; when Lenin describes the peculiar '<I>circumstances </I>' of Russia in 1917; when Marx (and the whole Marxist tradition) ex-

45. In the <I>Introduction</I> Marx gives us the best possible proof of the invariance of the structure in dominance within the apparent circularity of conditioning, when he analyses the identity of production, consumption and distribution through exchange. This might give the reader Hegelian vertigo -- 'nothing simpler, then, for a Hegelian than to pose production and consumption as identical' (<I>op. cit.</I>, p. 625) -- but this would be a complete misunderstanding. 'The result we have obtained is not that production, distribution, exchange and consumption are identical, but that they are all elements of one totality, differentiations within one unity' in which it is production in its specific difference that is determinant. 'So a determinate production determines a determinate consumption, distribution and exchange, and the determinate mutual relations of these different moments. For its part, production in its unilateral form is really determined by the other moments' (pp. 630-31).<BR>

46. I did not invent this concept. As I pointed out, it is borrowed from two existing disciplines: specifically, from linguistics and psychoanalysis. In these disciplines it has an objective dialectical 'connotation', and -- particularly in psychoanalysis -- one sufficiently related formally to the content it designates here for the loan not to be an arbitrary one. A new word is necessarily required to designate a new acquisition. A neologism might have been invented. Or it was possible to 'import' (in Kant's words) a concept sufficiently related to make its domestication (Kant) easy. And in return, this 'relatedness' might open up a path to psychoanalytic reality.

plains, with the aid of a thousand examples, that such and such a contradiction will dominate according to the case, etc., they are appealing to a concept that might appear to be <I>empirical </I>: the 'conditions', which are simultaneously the existing conditions and the conditions of existence of the phenomenon under consideration. Now this concept is essential to Marxism precisely because it is not an empirical concept: a statement about what exists. . . . On the contrary, it is a <I>theoretical</I> concept, with its basis in the very essence of the object: the ever-pre-given complex whole. In fact, these conditions are no more than the very existence of the whole in a determinate 'situation', the 'current situation' of the politician, that is, the complex relation of reciprocal conditions of existence between the articulations of the structure of the whole. That is why it is theoretically possible and legitimate to speak of the 'conditions' as of something that enables us to understand that the Revolution, 'the task of the day', could only break out here, in Russia, in China, in Cuba, in 1917, in 1949, in 1958, and not elsewhere; and not in another 'situation'; that the revolution, governed by capitalism's basic contradiction, did not succeed until Imperialism, and succeeded in the 'favourable' conditions that were precisely points of historical rupture, the 'weakest links': not England, France or Germany, but 'backward' Russia (Lenin), China and Cuba (ex-colonies, lands exploited by Imperialism). If it is theoretically acceptable to talk of the conditions without sliding into the empiricism or the irrationality of 'that's how it is' and of 'chance', it is because Marxism conceives the 'conditions' as the (real, concrete, current) existence of the contradictions that constitute the whole of a historical process. That is why Lenin's invocation of the 'existing conditions' in Russia was not a lapse into empiricism; he was analysing the very existence of the complex whole of the process of Imperialism in Russia in that 'current situation'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But if the conditions are no more than the current existence of the complex whole, they are its very contradictions, each reflecting in itself the organic relation it has with the others in the structure in dominance of the complex whole. Because each contradiction reflects in itself (in its specific relations of unevenness with the other contradictions, and in the relation of specific unevenness between its two aspects) the structure in dominance of 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 208</B></FONT><P>

the complex whole in which it exists, and therefore because of the current existence of this whole and therefore of its current 'conditions', the contradiction is identical with these conditions: so when we speak of the 'existing conditions' of the whole, we are speaking of its 'conditions of existence'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Is it necessary to return to Hegel once again to show that, for him, the 'circumstances' or 'conditions' are ultimately no more than phenomena and therefore evanescent, since in that form of 'contingency' christened the 'existence of Necessity', they can never express more than a manifestation of the movement of the Idea; that is why 'conditions' do not really exist for Hegel since, under cover of simplicity developing into complexity, he always deals with a pure interiority whose exteriority is no more than its phenomenon. That in Marxism the '<I>relation to nature </I>', for example, is organically part of the 'conditions of existence'; that it is one of the terms, the principal one, of the principal contradiction (forces of production/relations of production); that, as their condition of existence, it is reflected in the 'secondary' contradictions of the whole and their relations; that the conditions of existence are therefore a real absolute, the given-ever-pre-givenness of the existence of the complex whole which reflects them inside its own structure -- all this is quite foreign to Hegel, who, in one movement, rejects both the structured complex whole and its conditions of existence by his prior assumption of a pure, simple interiority. That is why, for example, the relation to nature, the conditions of existence of any human society, merely has the role of a contingent given for Hegel, the role of the 'inorganic', of climate, of geography (America, that 'syllogism whose middle term -- the Isthmus of Panama -- is very narrow'!), the role of the famous 'that's how it is!' (Hegel's comment at the sight of the mountains), designating the material nature which must be 'superseded' (<I>aufgehoben! </I>) by the Spirit which is its 'truth'. Yes, thus reduced to geographical nature, the conditions of existence really are the very contingency that will be resorbed, negated-superseded by the Spirit which is its free necessity and which already exists in Nature even in the form of contingency (the contingency that makes a small island produce a great man!). This is because natural or historical conditions of existence are never more than <I>contingency</I> for Hegel, because in no respect do they determine the 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 209</B></FONT><P>

spiritual totality of society; for Hegel, the absence of conditions (in the non-empirical, non-contingent sense) is a necessary counter-part to the absence of any real structure in the whole, and to the absence of a structure in dominance, the absence of any basic determination and the absence of that reflection of the conditions in the contradiction which its '<I>overdetermination </I>' represents. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I am insisting on this 'reflection' that I propose to call '<I>overdetermination </I>' at this point because it is absolutely essential to isolate it, identify it and give it a name, so that we can explain its reality theoretically, the reality which is forced on us by the political practice of Marxism as well as by its theoretical practice. Let us try to delimit this concept more accurately. Overdetermination designates the following essential quality of contradiction: the reflection in contradiction itself of its conditions of existence, that is, of its situation in the structure in dominance of the complex whole. This is not a univocal 'situation'. It is not just its situation '<I>in principle </I>' (the one it occupies in the hierarchy of instances in relation to the determinant instance: in society, the economy) nor just its situation '<I>in fact </I>' (whether, in the phase under consideration, it is dominant or subordinate) but <I>the relation of this situation in fact to this situation in principle</I>, that is, the very relation which makes of this situation in fact <I>a ' variation' of the -- ' invariant' --  structure</I>, <I>in dominance</I>, <I>of the totality.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   If this is correct, we must admit that contradiction can no longer be univocal (categories can no longer have a role and meaning fixed once and for all) since it reflects in itself, in its very essence, its relation to the unevenness of the complex whole. But we must add that, while no longer univocal, it has not for all that become 'equivocal' the product of the first-comer among empirical pluralities, at the mercy of circumstances and 'chance', their pure reflection, as the soul of some poet is merely that passing cloud. Quite the contrary, once it has ceased to be univocal and hence determined once and for all, standing to attention in its role and essence, it reveals itself as determined by the structured complexity that assigns it to its role, as -- if you will forgive me the astonishing expression -- complexly-structurally-unevenly determined. I must admit, I preferred a shorter term: overdetermined. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 210</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is this very peculiar type of determination (this overdetermination) which gives Marxist contradiction its specificity, and enables us to explain Marxist <I>practice</I> theoretically, whether it is theoretical or political. Only overdetermination enables us to understand the concrete variations and mutations of a structured complexity such as a social formation (the only one that has really been dealt with by Marxist practice up to now), not as the accidental variations and mutations produced by external 'conditions' in a fixed structured whole, in its categories and their fixed order (this is precisely mechanism) -- but as so many concrete restructuration inscribed in the essence, the 'play' of each category, in the essence, the 'play' of each contradiction, in the essence, the 'play' of the articulations of the complex structure in dominance which is reflected in them. Do we now need to repeat that unless we assume, think this very peculiar type of determination once we have identified it, we will never be able to think the possibility of political action, or even the possibility of theoretical practice itself, that is, very precisely, the essence of the object (the raw material) of <I>political</I> and <I>theoretical</I> practice, that is, the structure of the 'current situation' (in theory or politics) to which these practices' apply; do we need to add that unless we conceive this overdetermination we will be unable to explain theoretically the following simple reality: the prodigious 'labour' of a theoretician, be it Galileo, Spinoza or Marx, and of a revolutionary, Lenin and all his companions, devoting their suffering, if not their lives, to the resolution of these small 'problems': the elaboration of an '<I>obvious </I>' theory, the making of an '<I>inevitable </I>' revolution, the realization in their own personal 'contingency'(!) of the Necessity of History, theoretical or political, in which the future will soon quite naturally be living its 'present'? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To make this point clear, let us take up the very terms of Mao Tse-tung. If all contradictions are under the sway of the great law of unevenness, and to be a Marxist and to be able to act politically (and, I should add, to be able to produce theoretically), it is necessary at all costs to distinguish the principal from the secondary among contradictions and their aspects, and if this distinction is essential to Marxist theory and practice -- this is, Mao comments, because we must face up to concrete reality, to the reality of the history that men are living, if we are to explain a reality in 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 211</B></FONT><P>

which the <I>identity of opposites</I> is supreme, that is (1) the passage in indeterminate conditions of one opposite into the place of another,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp211">47</A>]</FONT> the exchange of roles between contradictions and their aspects (I shall call this phenomenon of substitution <I>displacement </I>), (2) the 'identity' of opposites in a real unity (I shall call this phenomenon of 'fusion' <I>condensation </I>). Indeed, the great lesson of practice is that if the structure in dominance remains constant, the disposition of the roles within it changes: the principal contradiction becomes a secondary one, a secondary contradiction takes its place, the principal aspect becomes a secondary one, the secondary aspect becomes the principal one. There is always one principal contradiction and secondary ones, but they exchange their roles in the structure articulated in dominance while this latter remains stable. '<I>There is no doubt at all that at every stage in the development of a process</I>, <I>there is only one principal contradiction which plays the leading role</I>,' says Mao Tse-tung. But this principal contradiction produced by <I>displacement</I> only becomes 'decisive', explosive, by <I>condensation</I> (by 'fusion'). It is the latter that constitutes the 'weakest link' that, as Lenin said, must be grasped and pulled in political practice (or in theoretical practice . . .) so that the whole chain will follow, or, to use a less linear image, it is the latter which occupies the strategic nodal position that must be attacked in order to produce '<I>the dissolution of</I> (<I>the existing </I>) <I>unity </I>'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[48]</FONT> Here again, we must not be taken in by the appearance of an arbitrary succession of dominations; for each one constitutes one stage in a complex process (the basis for the 'periodization' of history) and the fact that we are concerned with the dialectics of a complex process is the reason why we are concerned with those overdetermined, specific 'situations' the 'stages', 'phases' and 'periods', and with the mutations of specific domination that characterize each stage. The nodality of the development (the specific phases) and the specific nodality of the structure at each phase are the very existence and reality of the complex process. This is the basis of the reality, decisive in and for political practice (and obviously also for theoretical practice), of the displacements of domination and the condensations of the contradictions, which Lenin gave us such a clear and profound example of in his analysis of the 1917 Revo-

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Perhaps these gestures will help us to understand why the great law of unevenness suffers no exceptions.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp212">49</A>]</FONT> This unevenness suffers no exceptions because it is not itself an exception: not a derivatory law, produced by pecular conditions (Imperialism, for example) or intervening in the interference between the developments of distinct social formations (the unevenness of economic development, for example, between 'advanced' and 'backward' countries, between colonizers and colonized, etc.). Quite the contrary, it is a primitive law, with priority over these peculiar cases and able to account for them precisely in so far as it does not derive from their existence. Only because every social formation is affected by unevenness, are the relations of such a social formation with other formations of different economic, political and ideological maturity affected by it, and it enables us to understand how these relations are possible. So it is not external unevenness whose intervention is the basis for an internal unevenness (for example, the so-called meeting of civilizations), but, on the contrary, the internal unevenness has priority and is the basis for the role of the external unevenness, up to and including the effects this second unevenness has within social formations in confrontation. Every interpretation that reduces the phenomena of internal unevenness (for example, explaining the 'exceptional' conjuncture in Russia in 1917 solely by its relation of external unevenness: international relations, the uneven economic development of Russia as compared with the West, etc.) slides into mechanism, or into what is frequently an alibi for it: a theory of the reciprocal interaction of the inside and the outside. So it is essential to get down to the primitive internal unevenness to grasp the essence of the external unevenness. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The whole history of Marxist theory and practice confirms this point. Marxist theory and practice do not only approach unevenness as the external effect of the interaction of different existing social formations, but also within each social formation. And within each social formation, Marxist theory and practice do not only

approach unevenness in the form of simple exteriority (the <I>reciprocal action</I> of infrastructure and superstructure), but in a form organically <I>internal</I> to each instance of the social totality, to each contradiction. It is '<I>economism </I>' (mechanism) and not the true Marxist tradition that sets up the hierarchy of instances once and for all, assigns each its essence and role and defines the universal meaning of their relations; it is economism that identifies roles and actors eternally, not realizing that the necessity of the process lies in an exchange of roles 'according to circumstances'. It is economism that identifies eternally in advance the determinant contradiction-in-the-last-instance with the <I>role</I> of the dominant contradiction, which for ever assimilates such and such an 'aspect' (forces of production, economy, practice) to the principal <I>role</I>, and such and such another 'aspect' (relations of production, politics, ideology, theory) to the secondary <I>role</I> -- whereas in real history determination in the last instance by the economy is exercised precisely in the permutations of the principal role between the economy, politics, theory, etc. Engels saw this quite clearly and pointed it out in his struggle with the opportunists in the Second International, who were awaiting the arrival of socialism through the action of the economy alone. The whole of Lenin's political work witnesses to the profundity of this principle: that determination in the last instance by the economy is exercised, according to the phases of the process, not accidentally, not for external or contingent reasons, but essentially, for internal and necessary reasons, by permutations, displacements and condensations. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So unevenness is internal to a social formation because the structuration in dominance of the complex whole, this structural invariant, <I>is itself the precondition for the concrete variation of the contradictions</I> that constitute it, and therefore for their displacements, condensations and mutations, etc., and inversely because <I>this variation is the existence of that invariant.</I> So uneven development (that is, these same phenomena of displacement and condensation observable in the development process of a complex whole) is not external to contradiction, but constitutes its most intimate essence. So the unevenness that exists in the 'development' of contradictions, that is, in the process itself, exists in the essence of contradiction itself. If it were not that the concept of 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 214</B></FONT><P>

<I>unevenness</I> has been associated with an external comparison of a quantitative character, I should gladly describe Marxist contradiction as '<I>unevenly determined </I>' granted recognition of the internal essence designated by this unevenness: <I>overdetermination.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We still have one last point to examine: the <I>motor</I> role of contradiction in the development of a process. An understanding of contradiction is meaningless unless it allows us to understand this motor. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What has been said of Hegel enables us to understand in what sense the Hegelian dialectic is a motive force, and in what sense the concept is 'autodevelopment'. In a text as beautiful as the night, the <I>Phenomenology</I> celebrates '<I>the labour of the negative </I>' in beings and works, the Spirit's sojourn even in death, the universal trouble of negativity dismembering the corpse of Being to give birth to the glorious body of that infinity of nothingness become Being, the Spirit -- and every philosopher trembles in his soul as if he was in the presence of the Mysteries. But negativity can only contain the motor principle of the dialectic, the negation of the negation, as a strict reflection of the Hegelian theoretical presuppositions of simplicity and origin. The dialectic is negativity as an abstraction of the negation of the negation, itself an abstraction of the phenomenon of the restoration of the alienation of the original unity. That is why the End is in action in every Hegelian beginning; that is why the origin does no more than grow by itself and produce in itself its own end, in its alienation. So the Hegelian concept of '<I>what maintains itself in being-other-than-itself </I>' is the existence of negativity. So contradiction is a motive force for Hegel as negativity, that is, as a pure reflection of 'the being-in-itself even in being-other-than-itself', therefore as a pure reflection of the principle of alienation itself: the simplicity of the Idea. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This cannot be true for Marx. If the only processes we are dealing with are processes of the complex structure in dominance, the concept of negativity (and the concepts it reflects: the negation of the negation, alienation, etc.) cannot help towards a scientific understanding of their development. Just as the development's type of necessity cannot be reduced to the ideological necessity of the reflection of the end on its beginning, so the motor principle of this development cannot be reduced to the development of the idea in its own alienation. So, in Marxism, <I>negativity</I> and <I>aliena-</I> 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 215</B></FONT><P>

<I>tion</I> are <I>ideological</I> concepts that can <I>only</I> designate their own <I>ideological</I> content. Nevertheless, the fact that the Hegelian type of necessity and the Hegelian essence of development should be rejected does not mean at all that we are in the theoretical void of subjectivity, of 'pluralism' or of contingency. Quite the contrary, only on condition that we free ourselves from these Hegelian presuppositions can we be really sure of escaping this void. Indeed, it is because the process is complex and possesses a structure in dominance that its development, and all the typical aspects of this development, can really be explained. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I shall only give one example of this here. How is it possible, theoretically, to sustain the validity of this basic Marxist proposition: '<I>the class struggle is the motor of history </I>', that is sustain theoretically the thesis that it is by <I>political</I> struggle that it is possible to '<I>dissolve the existing unity </I>', when we know very well that it is not politics but the economy that is determinant in the last instance? How, other than with the reality of the complex process with structure in dominance, could we explain theoretically the real difference between the economic and the political in the class struggle itself, that is, to be exact, the real difference between the economic struggle and the political struggle, a difference that will always distinguish Marxism from any spontaneous or organized form of opportunism? How could we explain our necessity to go through the distinct and specific level of <I>political</I> struggle if the latter, although distinct, and because it is distinct, were the simple phenomenon and not the real <I>condensation</I>, the nodal strategic point, in which <I>is reflected the complex whole</I> (economic, political and ideological)? How, finally, could we explain the fact that the Necessity of History itself thus goes in decisive fashion through <I>political practice</I>, if the structure of contradiction did not make this practice possible in its concrete reality? How could we explain the fact that even Marx's theory which made this necessity comprehensible to us could have been <I>produced</I> if the structure of contradiction did not make the concrete reality of this production possible? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So, in Marxist theory, to say that contradiction is a motive force is to say that it implies <I>a real struggle</I>, <I>real confrontations</I>, <I>precisely located within the structure of the complex whole </I>; it is to say that the locus of confrontation may vary according to the relation of 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 216</B></FONT><P>

the contradictions in the structure in dominance in any given situation; it is to say that the <I>condensation</I> of the struggle in a strategic locus is inseparable from the <I>displacement</I> of the dominant among these contradictions; that the organic phenomena of <I>condensation</I> and <I>displacement</I> are the very existence of the 'identity of opposites' until they produce the globally visible form of the <I>mutation</I> or qualitative leap that sanctions the revolutionary situation when the whole is recrystallized. Given this, we can explain the crucial distinction for political practice between the distinct moments of a process: '<I>non-antagonism </I>', '<I>antagonism </I>' and '<I>explosion </I>'. Contradiction, says Lenin, is always at work, in every moment. So these three moments are merely three forms of its existence. I shall characterize the first as the moment when the overdetermination of a contradiction exists <I>in the dominant form of displacement</I> (the 'metonymic' form of what has been enshrined in the phrase: '<I>quantitative changes </I>' in history or theory); the second, as the moment when overdetermination exists <I>in the dominant form of condensation</I> (acute class conflict in the case of society, theoretical crisis in a science, etc.); and the last, the revolutionary explosion (in society, in theory, etc.), as the moment of unstable global condensation inducing the dissolution and resolution of the whole, that is, a global restructuring of the whole on a qualitatively new basis. So the purely 'accumulative' form, in so far as this 'accumulation' can be purely quantitative (addition is only <I>exceptionally</I> dialectical), seems to be only a subordinate form, and Marx only ever gave one pure example of it, an unmetaphorical example this time, but an 'exceptional' one (an exception with a basis in its own conditions), in the unique passage from <I>Capital</I> which became the object of a famous commentary by Engels in <I>Anti-D&uuml;hring</I> (Part 1, Chapter 12).

   If I may close by summing up the argument of this analysis, imperfect and didactic as it obviously is, I hope I shall be allowed to remind the reader that I merely undertook to give a theoretical expression of the specific difference of the Marxist dialectic active in the theoretical and political practices of Marxism, and that this was the object of the problem I had posed: the problem of the nature of Marx's 'inversion' of the Hegelian dialectic. If this 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 217</B></FONT><P>

analysis is not too unfaithful to the elementary demands of theoretical investigation I defined at the outset, then its theoretical solution should provide us with <I>more theoretical information</I>, that is, some knowledges. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   If this is indeed the case, we should have acquired a theoretical result that might be expressed schematically in the following form: 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>The specific difference of Marxist contradiction is its</I> '<I>unevenness </I>' <I>or</I> '<I>overdetermination </I>', <I>which reflects in it its conditions of existence</I>, <I>that is</I>, <I>the specific structure of unevenness</I> (<I>in dominance </I>) <I>of the ever-pre-given complex whole which is its existence. Thus understood</I>, <I>contradiction is the motor of all development. Displacement and condensation</I>, <I>with their basis in its overdetermination</I>, <I>explain by their dominance the phases</I> (<I>non-antagonistic</I>, <I>antagonistic and explosive </I>) <I>which constitute the existence of the complex process</I>, <I>that is</I>, '<I>of the development of things </I>'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   If, as Lenin said, the dialectic is the conception of the contradiction in the very essence of things, the principle of their development and disappearance, then with this definition of the specificity of Marxist contradiction we should have reached <I>the Marxist dialectic</I> itself.<FONT SIZE=-2>[50]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Like every theoretical expression, this definition only exists in the concrete contents it enables us to think. 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
50. Those put off by this abstract definition might consider the fact that it explains no more than the essence of the dialectic at work in the concrete of Marxist thought and action. Those surprised by this unusual definition might consider the fact that it concerns very exactly the understanding of the 'development', of the 'birth and death' of phenomena, which a long tradition has associated with the word 'dialectic'. Those disconcerted by this definition (which does not regard any Hegelian concept as essential, neither negativity, negation, fission, the negation of the negation, alienation, 'supersession') might consider the fact that it is always a gain to lose an inadequate concept if the concept gained in exchange is more adequate to real practice. Those yearning after the simplicity of the Hegelian 'womb' might consider the fact that in 'certain determinate conditions' (really, exceptional conditions) the materialist dialectic can represent in a very limited sector, a 'Hegelian' form, but, precisely because it is an exception, it is not this form itself, that is, the exception, but its conditions that must be generalized. To think these conditions is to think the possibility of its own 'exceptions'. The Marxist dialectic thus enables us to think what constituted the 'crux' of the Hegelian dialectic: for example, the <I>non-development</I>, the stagnation of the 'societies without history' be they primitive or otherwise; for example the phenomenon of real 'survivals', etc. 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 218</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Like every theoretical expression, this definition should first of all enable us to think these concrete contents. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It cannot claim to be Theory in the general sense of the term, unless it enables us to think the whole set of concrete contents, those it did not arise from as well as those it did. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We have expressed this definition of the dialectic <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> two concrete contents: the theoretical practice and the political practice of Marxism.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To justify its general scope, to verify that this definition of the dialectic really does go beyond the domain <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> which it was expressed and can therefore claim a theoretically tempered and tested universality, it remains to put it to the test of other concrete contents, <I>other practices </I>; for example, the test of the theoretical practice of the natural sciences, the test of the theoretical practices which are still problematic in the sciences (epistemology, the history of science, of ideology, philosophy, etc.) to check on their scope and eventually, as must be, to correct their formulation, in short, to see whether in the '<I>particular </I>' that has been examined, the universal has really been grasped that made of it this '<I>particularity </I>'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This could and should be the occasion for new investigations.

<P>
Today, Socialist 'Humanism' is on the agenda. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   As it enters the period which will lead it from socialism (to each according to his labour) to communism (to each according to his needs), the Soviet Union has proclaimed the slogan: All for Man, and introduced new themes: the freedom of the individual, respect for legality, the dignity of the person. In workers' parties the achievements of socialist humanism are celebrated and justification for its theoretical claims is sought in <I>Capital</I>, and more and more frequently, in Marx's Early Works. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This is a historical event. I wonder even whether socialist humanism is not such a reassuring and attractive theme that it will allow a dialogue between Communists and Social-Democrats, or even a wider exchange with those 'men of good will' who are opposed to war and poverty. Today, even the high-road of Humanism seems to lead to socialism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In fact, the objective of the revolutionary struggle has always been the end of exploitation and hence the liberation of man, but, as Marx foresaw, in its first historical phase, this struggle had to take the form of the struggle between <I>classes.</I> So revolutionary humanism could only be a 'class humanism', 'proletarian humanism'. The end of the exploitation of man meant the end of <I>class</I> exploitation. The liberation of man meant the liberation of the working <I>class</I> and above all liberation by the dictatorship of the proletariat. For more than forty years, in the U.S.S.R., amidst gigantic struggles, 'socialist humanism' was expressed in the terms of class dictatorship rather than in those of personal freedom.<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
1. Here I am using 'class humanism' in the sense of Lenin's statement that the October socialist revolution had given power to the working classes, the workers and the poor peasants, and that, <I>on their behalf</I>, it had secured conditions of life, action and development that they had never known before: democracy <I>for</I> the working classes, dictatorship <I>over</I> the oppressors. I am not using 'class humanism' in the sense adopted in Marx's early works, where the proletariat in its 'alienation' represents the human essence itself, [<FONT SIZE=-2><I>cont. onto</I> p. 222. <I>-- DJR</I></FONT>] whose 'realization' is to be assured by the revolution; this 'religious' conception of the proletariat (the 'universal class', since it is the 'loss of man' in 'revolt against its own loss') was re-adopted by the young Luk&aacute;cs in his <I>Geschichte und Klassenbewusstsein.</I> 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 222</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The end of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the U.S.S.R. opens up a second historical phase. The Soviets say, in our country antagonistic classes have disappeared, the dictatorship of the proletariat has fulfilled its function, the State is no longer a class State but the State of the whole people (of everyone). In the U.S.S.R. men are indeed now treated without any class distinction, that is, as <I>persons.</I> So <I>in ideology</I> we see the themes of class humanism give way before the themes of a socialist humanism of the person. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Ten years ago socialist humanism only existed in one form: that of class humanism. Today it exists in two forms: class humanism, where the dictatorship of the proletariat is still in force (China, etc.), and (socialist) personal humanism where it has been superseded (the U.S.S.R.). Two forms corresponding to two necessary historical phases. In 'personal' humanism, 'class' humanism contemplates its own future, realized. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This transformation in history casts light on certain transformations in the mind. The dictatorship of the proletariat, rejected by Social-Democrats in the name of (bourgeois) personal 'humanism', and which bitterly opposes them to Communists, has been superseded in the U.S.S.R. Even better, it is foreseeable that it might take peaceful and short-lived forms in the West. From here we can see in outline a sort of meeting between two personal 'humanisms', socialist humanism and Christian or bourgeois liberal humanism. The 'liberalization' of the U.S.S.R. reassures the latter. As for socialist humanism, it can see itself not only as a critique of the contradictions of bourgeois humanism, but also and above all as the consummation of its 'noblest' aspirations. Humanity's millenarian dreams, prefigured in the drafts of past humanisms, Christian and bourgeois, will at last find realization in it: in man and between men, the reign of Man will at last begin. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Hence the fulfilment of the prophetic promise Marx made in the <I>1844 Manuscripts </I>: <I>Communism . . . as the real appropriation of the human essence through and for men . . . this communism as a fully developed naturalism -- Humanism </I>'. 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 223</B></FONT>
<P>&nbsp;<BR>

II
<P>
To see beyond this event, to understand it, to know the meaning of socialist humanism, it is not enough just to register the event, nor to record the concepts (humanism, socialism) in which the event itself thinks itself. The theoretical claims of the concepts must be tested to ensure that they really do provide us with a truly scientific knowledge of the event. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But precisely in the couple 'humanism-socialism' there is a striking theoretical unevenness: in the framework of the Marxist conception, the concept 'socialism' is indeed a scientific concept, but the concept 'humanism' is no more than an <I>ideological</I> one. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Note that my purpose is not to dispute the reality that the concept of socialist humanism is supposed to designate, but to define the <I>theoretical</I> value of the concept. When I say that the concept of humanism is an ideological concept (not a scientific one), I mean that while it really does designate a set of existing relations, unlike a scientific concept, it does not provide us with a means of knowing them. In a particular (ideological) mode, it designates some existents, but it does not give us their essences. If we were to confuse these two orders we should cut ourselves off from all knowledge, uphold a confusion and risk falling into error. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To show this clearly, I shall briefly invoke Marx's own experience, for he only arrived at a scientific theory of history at the price of a radical critique of the philosophy of man that had served as his theoretical basis during the years of his youth (1840-45). I use the words 'theoretical basis' in their strict sense. For the young Marx, 'Man' was not just a cry denouncing poverty and slavery. It was the theoretical principle of his world outlook and of his practical attitude. The 'Essence of Man' (whether freedom -- reason or community) was the basis both for a rigorous theory of history and for a consistent political practice. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This can be seen in the two stages of Marx's humanist period. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>The First Stage</I> was dominated by a liberal-rationalist humanism closer to Kant and Fichte than to Hegel. In his conflict with censorship, Rhenish feudal laws, Prussian despotism, Marx's political struggle and the theory of history sustaining it were based theoretically on a philosophy of man. Only the essence of man 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 224</B></FONT><P>

makes history, and this essence is freedom and reason. <I>Freedom </I>: it is the essence of man just as weight is the essence of bodies. Man is destined to freedom, it is his very being. Whether he rejects it or negates it, he remains in it for ever: '<I>So much is freedom the essence of Man that even its adversaries are realizing it when they fight against its reality. . . . So freedom has always existed</I>, <I>in one way or another</I>, <I>sometimes only as a particular privilege</I>, <I>sometimes as a general right </I>.'<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp224">2</A>]</FONT> This distinction illuminates the whole of history: thus, feudalism is freedom, but in the 'non-rational' form of privilege; the modern State is freedom, but in the rational form of a universal right. <I>Reason </I>: man is only freedom as reason. Human freedom is neither caprice, nor the determinism of interest, but, as Kant and Fichte meant it, autonomy, obedience to the inner law of reason. This reason, which has '<I>always existed though not always in a rational form </I>'<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp224">3</A>]</FONT> (e.g. feudalism), in modern times does at least exist in the form of reason in the State, the State of law and right. '<I>Philosophy regards the State as the great organism in which legal</I>, <I>moral and political freedom should find their realization and in which the individual citizen</I>, <I>when he obeys the State's laws</I>, <I>is only obeying the natural laws of his own reason</I>, <I>of human reason </I>.'<FONT SIZE=-2>[4]</FONT> Hence the task of philosophy: '<I>Philosophy demands that the State be the State of human nature </I>'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[5]</FONT> This injunction is addressed to the State itself: if it would recognize its essence it would become reason, the true freedom of man, through its own reform of itself. Therefore, politico-philosophical criticism (which reminds the State of its duty to itself) sums up the whole of politics: the free Press, the free reason of humanity, becomes politics itself. This political practice -- summed up in <I>public theoretical criticism</I>, that is, in public criticism by way of the Press -- which demands as its absolute precondition the <I>freedom of the Press</I> is the one Marx adopted in the <I>Rheinische Zeitung.</I> Marx's development of his theory of history was the basis and justification for his own <I>practice </I>: the journalist's public criticism that he saw as political action

<I>par excellence.</I> This Enlightenment Philosophy was completely rigorous. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>The Second Stage</I> (1842-5) was dominated by a new form of humanism: Feuerbach's 'communalist' humanism. The Reason State had remained deaf to reason: there was no reform of the Prussian State. History itself delivered this judgement on the illusions of the humanism of reason: the young German radicals had been expecting that when he was King the heir to the throne would keep the liberal promises he had made before his coronation. But the throne soon changed the liberal into a despot -- the State, which should at last have become reason, since it was in itself reason, gave birth merely to unreason once again. From this enormous disappointment, lived by the young radicals as a true historical and theoretical crisis, Marx drew the conclusion: '<I>The political State . . . encapsulates the demands of reason precisely in its modern forms. But it does not stop there. Everywhere it presupposes realized reason. But everywhere it also slides into the contradiction between its theoretical definition and its real hypotheses </I>.' A decisive step had been taken: the State's abuses were no longer conceived as misappropriations of the State <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> its essence, but as a real contradiction between its essence (reason) and its existence (unreason). Feuerbach's humanism made it possible to think just this contradiction by showing in unreason the alienation of reason, and in this alienation the history of man, that is, his realization.<FONT SIZE=-2>[6]</FONT> 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
6. This confluence of Feuerbach and the theoretical crisis in which history had thrown the young German radicals explains their enthusiasm for the author of the <I>Provisional Theses</I>, of the <I>Essence of Christianity</I> and of the <I>Principles of the Philosophy of the Future.</I> Indeed, Feuerbach represented the <I>theoretical</I> solution to the young intellectuals' theoretical crisis. In his humanism of alienation, he gave them the theoretical concepts that enabled them to think the alienation of the human essence as an indispensable moment in the realization of the human essence, unreason (the irrational <I>reality</I> of the State) as a necessary moment in the realization of reason (the idea of the State). It thus enabled them to <I>think</I> what they would otherwise have suffered as irrationality itself: the necessary <I>connexion</I> between reason and unreason. Of course, this relation remained trapped in a philosophical anthropology, its basis, with this theoretical proviso: the remanipulation of the concept of man, indispensable to think the historical relation between historical reason and unreason. Man ceases to be defined by reason and freedom: he becomes, in his very principle, 'communalist', concrete intersubjectivity, love, fraternity, 'species being'. 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 226</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Marx still professes a philosophy of man: 'To be radical is to grasp things by the root; but for man the root is man himself' (1843). But then man is only freedom-reason because he is first of all '<I>Gemeinwesen </I>', 'communal being', a being that is only consummated theoretically (science) and practically (politics) in universal human relations, with men and with his objects (external nature 'humanized' by labour). Here also the essence of man is the basis for history and politics. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   History is the alienation and production of reason in unreason, of the true man in the alienated man. Without knowing it, man realizes the essence of man in the alienated products of his labour (commodities, State, religion). The loss of man that produces history and man must presuppose a definite pre-existing essence. At the end of history, this man, having become inhuman objectivity, has merely to re-grasp as subject his own essence alienated in property, religion and the State to become total man, true man. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This new theory of man is the basis for a new type of political action: the politics of <I>practical</I> reappropriation. The appeal to the simple reason of the State disappears. Politics is no longer simply theoretical criticism, the enlightenment of reason through the free Press, but man's practical reappropriation of his essence. For the State, like religion, may well be man, but man dispossessed: man is split into citizen (State) and civil man, two abstractions. In the heaven of the State, in 'the citizen's rights', man lives in imagination the human community he is deprived of on the earth of the 'rights of man'. So the revolution must no longer be merely <I>political</I> (rational liberal reform of the State), but '<I>human </I>' ('communist'), if man is to be restored his nature, alienated in the fantastic forms of money, power and gods. From this point on, this practical revolution must be the common work of philosophy and of the proletariat, for, in philosophy, man is theoretically affirmed; in the proletariat he is practically negated. The penetration of philosophy into the proletariat will be the conscious revolt of the affirmation against its own negation, the revolt of man against his inhuman conditions. Then the proletariat will negate its own negation and take possession of itself in communism. The revolution is the very <I>practice</I> of the logic immanent in alienation: it is the moment in which criticism, hitherto unarmed, recognizes its arms in the prole- 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 227</B></FONT><P>

tariat. It gives the proletariat the theory of what it is; in return, the proletariat gives it its armed force, a single unique force in which no one is allied except to himself. So the revolutionary alliance of the proletariat and of philosophy is once again sealed in the essence of man. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR>

<P>
In 1845, Marx broke radically with every theory that based history and politics on an essence of man. This unique rupture contained three indissociable elements. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (1) The formation of a theory of history and politics based on radically new concepts: the concepts of social formation, productive forces, relations of production, superstructure, ideologies, determination in the last instance by the economy, specific determination of the other levels, etc. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (2) A radical critique of the <I>theoretical</I> pretensions of every philosophical humanism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (3) The definition of humanism as an <I>ideology.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This new conception is completely rigorous as well, but it is a new rigour: the essence criticized (2) is defined as an ideology (3), a category belonging to the new theory of society and history (1). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This rupture with every <I>philosophical</I> anthropology or humanism is no secondary detail; it is Marx's scientific discovery. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It means that Marx rejected the problematic of the earlier philosophy and adopted a new problematic in one and the same act. The earlier idealist ('bourgeois') philosophy depended in all its domains and arguments (its 'theory of knowledge', its conception of history, its political economy, its ethics, its aesthetics, etc.) on a problematic of <I>human nature</I> (or the essence of man). For centuries, this problematic had been transparency itself, and no one had thought of questioning it even in its internal modifications. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This problematic was neither vague nor loose; on the contrary, it was constituted by a coherent system of precise concepts tightly articulated together. When Marx confronted it, it implied the two complementary postulates he defined in the Sixth Thesis on Feuerbach: 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 228</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (1) that there is a universal essence of man; 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   (2) that this essence is the attribute of '<I>each single individual </I>' who is its real subject.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   These two postulates are complementary and indissociable. But their existence and their unity presuppose a whole empiricist-idealist world outlook. If the essence of man is to be a universal attribute, it is essential that <I>concrete subjects</I> exist as absolute givens; this implies an <I>empiricism of the subject.</I> If these empirical individuals are to be men, it is essential that each carries in himself the whole human essence, if not in fact, at least in principle; this implies an <I>idealism of the essence.</I> So empiricism of the subject implies idealism of the essence and vice versa. This relation  can be inverted into its 'opposite' -- empiricism of the concept/idealism of the subject. But the inversion respects the basic structure of the problematic, which remains fixed.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In this type-structure it is possible to recognize not only the principle of theories of society (from Hobbes to Rousseau), of political economy (from Petty to Ricardo), of ethics (from Descartes to Kant), but also the very principle of the (pre-Marxist) idealist and materialist 'theory of knowledge' (from Locke to Feuerbach, via Kant). The content of the human essence or of the empirical subjects may vary (as can be seen from Descartes to Feuerbach); the subject may change from empiricism to idealism (as can be seen from Locke to Kant): the terms presented and their relations only vary within the invariant type-structure which constitutes this very problematic: <I>an empiricism of the subject always corresponds to an idealism of the essence</I> (<I>or an empiricism of the essence to an idealism of the subject </I>).

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   By rejecting the essence of man as his theoretical basis, Marx rejected the whole of this organic system of postulates. He drove the philosophical categories of the <I>subject</I>, of <I>empiricism</I>, of the <I>ideal essence</I>, etc., from all the domains in which they had been supreme. Not only from political economy (rejection of the myth of <I>homo economicus</I>, that is, of the individual with definite faculties and needs as the <I>subject</I> of the classical economy); not just from history (rejection of social atomism and ethico-political idealism); not just from ethics (rejection of the Kantian ethical idea); but also from philosophy itself: for Marx's materialism excludes the empiricism of the subject (and its inverse: the transcen-

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 229</B></FONT><P>

dental subject) and the idealism of the concept (and its inverse: the empiricism of the concept). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This total theoretical revolution was only empowered to reject the old concepts because it replaced them by new concepts. In fact Marx established a new problematic, a new systematic way of asking questions of the world, new principles and a new method. This discovery is immediately contained in the theory of historical materialism, in which Marx did not only propose a new theory of the history of societies, but at the same time implicitly, but necessarily, a new 'philosophy', infinite in its implications. Thus, when Marx replaced the old couple individuals/human essence in the theory of history by new concepts (forces of production, relations of production, etc.), he was, in fact, simultaneously proposing a new conception of 'philosophy'. He replaced the old postulates (empiricism/idealism of the subject, empiricism/idealism of the essence) which were the basis not only for idealism but also for pre-Marxist materialism, by a historico-dialectical materialism of <I>praxis </I>: that is, by a theory of the different specific <I>levels</I> of <I>human practice</I> (economic practice, political practice, ideological practice, scientific practice) in their characteristic articulations, based on the specific articulations of the unity of human society. In a word, Marx substituted for the 'ideological' and universal concept of Feuerbachian 'practice' a concrete conception of the specific differences that enables us to situate each particular practice in the specific differences of the social structure. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So, to understand what was radically new in Marx's contribution, we must become aware not only of the novelty of the concepts of historical materialism, but also of the depth of the theoretical revolution they imply and inaugurate. On this condition it is possible to define humanism's status, and reject its <I>theoretical</I> pretensions while recognizing its practical function as an ideology. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Strictly in respect to theory, therefore, one can and must speak openly of <I>Marx's theoretical anti-humanism</I>, and see in this <I>theoretical anti-humanism</I> the absolute (negative) precondition of the (positive) knowledge of the human world itself, and of its practical transformation. It is impossible to <I>know</I> anything about men except on the absolute precondition that the philosophical (theoretical) myth of man is reduced to ashes. So any thought that appeals to Marx for any kind of restoration of a theoretical anthropology or 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 230</B></FONT><P>

humanism is no more than ashes, <I>theoretically.</I> But in practice it could pile up a monument of pre-Marxist ideology that would weigh down on real history and threaten to lead it into blind alleys. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   For the corollary of theoretical Marxist anti-humanism is the recognition and knowledge of humanism itself: as an <I>ideology.</I> Marx never fell into the idealist illusion of believing that the knowledge of an object might ultimately replace the object or dissipate its existence. Cartesians, knowing that the sun was two thousand leagues away, were astonished that this distance only looked like two hundred paces: they could not even find enough of God to fill in this gap. Marx never believed that a knowledge of the nature of <I>money</I> (a social relation) could destroy its <I>appearance</I>, its form of existence -- a thing, for this appearance was its very being, as necessary as the existing mode of production.<FONT SIZE=-2>[7]</FONT> Marx never believed that an ideology might be dissipated by a knowledge of it: for the knowledge of this ideology, as the knowledge of its conditions of possibility, of its structure, of its specific logic and of its practical role, within a given society, is simultaneously knowledge of the conditions of its necessity. So Marx's theoretical <I>anti-humanism</I> does not suppress anything in the historical <I>existence</I> of human

7. The whole, fashionable, theory of 'reification' depends on a projection of the theory of alienation found in the early texts, particularly the <I>1844 Manuscripts</I>, on to the theory of 'fetishism' in <I>Capital.</I> In the <I>1844 Manuscripts</I>, the objectification of the human essence is claimed as the indispensable preliminary to the reappropriation of the human essence by man. Throughout the process of objectification, man only exists in the form of an objectivity in which he meets his own essence in the appearance of a foreign, non-human, essence. This 'objectification' is not called 'reification' even though it is called <I>inhuman.</I> Inhumanity is not represented <I>par excellence</I> by the model of a 'thing': but sometimes by the model of animality (or even of pre-animality -- the man who no longer even has simple animal relations with nature), sometimes by the model of the omnipotence and fascination of transcendence (God, the State) and of money, which is, of course, a 'thing'. In <I>Capital</I> the only social relation that is presented in the form of a <I>thing</I> (this piece of metal) is <I>money.</I> But the conception of money as a <I>thing</I> (that is, the confusion of value with use-value in money) does not correspond to the reality of this 'thing': it is not the brutality of a simple 'thing' that man is faced with when he is in direct relation with money; it is a <I>power</I> (or a <I>lack</I> of it) over things and men. An ideology of reification that sees 'things' everywhere in human relations confuses in this category 'thing' (a category more foreign to Marx cannot be imagined) every social relation, conceived according to the model of a money-thing ideology.

ism. In the real world philosophies of man are found after Marx as often as before, and today even some Marxists are tempted to develop the themes of a new theoretical humanism. Furthermore, Marx's theoretical anti-humanism, by relating it to its conditions of existence, recognizes a necessity for humanism as an <I>ideology</I>, a conditional necessity. The recognition of this necessity is not purely speculative. On it alone can Marxism base a policy in relation to the existing ideological forms, of every kind: religion, ethics, art, philosophy, law -- and in the very front rank, humanism. When (eventually) a Marxist policy of humanist ideology, that is, a political attitude to humanism, is achieved -- a policy which may be either a rejection or a critique, or a use, or a support, or a development, or a humanist renewal of contemporary forms of ideology in the <I>ethico-political</I> domain -- this policy will only have been possible on the absolute condition that it is based on Marxist philosophy, and a precondition for this is theoretical <I>anti-humanism.</I>

<P>
So everything depends on the knowledge of the nature of humanism as an ideology. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   There can be no question of attempting a profound definition of ideology here. It will suffice to know very schematically that an ideology is a system (with its own logic and rigour) of representations (images, myths, ideas or concepts, depending on the case) endowed with a historical existence and role within a given society. Without embarking on the problem of the relations between a science and its (ideological) past, we can say that ideology, as a system of representations, is distinguished from science in that in it the practico-social function is more important than the theoretical function (function as knowledge). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What is the nature of this social function? To understand it we must refer to the Marxist theory of history. The 'subjects' of history are given human societies. They present themselves as totalities whose unity is constituted by a certain specific type of <I>complexity</I>, which introduces instances, that, following Engels, we can, very schematically, reduce to three: the economy, politics and 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 232</B></FONT><P>

ideology. So in every society we can posit, in forms which are sometimes very paradoxical, the existence of an economic activity as the base, a political organization and 'ideological' forms (religion, ethics, philosophy, etc.). <I>So ideology is as such an organic part of every social totality.</I> It is as if human societies could not survive without these <I>specific formations</I>, these systems of representations (at various levels), their ideologies. Human societies secrete ideology as the very element and atmosphere indispensable to their historical respiration and life. Only an ideological world outlook could have imagined societies <I>without ideology</I> and accepted the utopian idea of a world in which ideology (not just one of its historical forms) would disappear without trace, to be replaced by <I>science.</I> For example, this utopia is the principle behind the idea that ethics, which is in its essence ideology, could be replaced by science or become scientific through and through; or that religion could be destroyed by science which would in some way take its place; that <I>art</I> could merge with knowledge or become 'everyday life', etc. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And I am not going to steer clear of the crucial question: <I>historical materialism cannot conceive that even a communist society could ever do without ideology</I>, be it ethics, art or 'world outlook'. Obviously it is possible to foresee important modifications in its ideological forms and their relations and even the disappearance of certain existing forms or a shift of their functions to neighbouring forms; it is also possible (on the premise of already acquired experience) to foresee the development of new ideological forms (e.g. the ideologies of 'the scientific world outlook' and 'communist humanism') but in the present state of Marxist theory strictly conceived, it is not conceivable that communism, a new mode of production implying determinate forces of production and relations of production, could do without a social organization of production, and corresponding ideological forms. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So ideology is not an aberration or a contingent excrescence of History: it is a structure essential to the historical life of societies. Further, only the existence and the recognition of its necessity enable us to act on ideology and transform ideology into an instrument of deliberate action on history. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is customary to suggest that ideology belongs to the region of 'consciousness'. We must not be misled by this appellation 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 233</B></FONT><P>

which is still contaminated by the idealist problematic that preceded Marx. In truth, ideology has very little to do with 'consciousness', even supposing this term to have an unambiguous meaning. It is profoundly <I>unconscious</I>, even when it presents itself in a reflected form (as in pre-Marxist 'philosophy'). Ideology is indeed a system of representations, but in the majority of cases these representations have nothing to do with 'consciousness': they are usually images and occasionally concepts, but it is above all as structures that they impose on the vast majority of men, not via their 'consciousness'. They are perceived-accepted-suffered cultural objects and they act functionally on men via a process that escapes them. Men 'live' their ideologies as the Cartesian 'saw' or did not see -- if he was not looking at it -- the moon two hundred paces away: <I>not at an as a form of consciousness</I>, <I>but as an object of their</I> '<I>world </I>' -- as their '<I>world </I>' itself. But what do we mean, then, when we say that ideology is a matter of men's 'consciousness'? First, that ideology is distinct from other social instances, but also that men live their actions, usually referred to freedom and 'consciousness' by the classical tradition, in ideology, <I>by and through ideology </I>; in short, that the 'lived' relation between men and the world, including History (in political action or inaction), passes through ideology, or better, <I>is ideology itself.</I> This is the sense in which Marx said that it is in ideology (as the locus of political struggle) that men <I>become conscious</I> of their place in the world and in history, it is within this ideological unconsciousness that men succeed in altering the 'lived' relation between them and the world and acquiring that new form of specific unconsciousness called 'consciousness'. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So ideology is a matter of the <I>lived</I> relation between men and their world. This relation, that only appears as '<I>conscious </I>' on condition that it is <I>unconscious</I>, in the same way only seems to be simple on condition that it is complex, that it is not a simple relation but a relation between relations, a second degree relation. In ideology men do indeed express, not the relation between them their conditions of existence, but <I>the way</I> they live the relation between them and their conditions of existence: this presupposes both a real relation and an '<I>imaginary </I>', '<I>lived </I>' relation. Ideology, then, is the expression of the relation between men and their 'world', that is, the (overdetermined) unity of the real relation and the 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 234</B></FONT><P>

imaginary relation between them and their real conditions of existence. In ideology the real relation is inevitably invested in the imaginary relation, a relation that <I>expresses</I> a <I>will</I> (conservative, conformist, reformist or revolutionary), a hope or a nostalgia, rather than describing a reality. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is in this overdetermination of the real by the imaginary and of the imaginary by the real that ideology is <I>active</I> in principle, that it reinforces or modifies the relation between men and their conditions of existence, in the imaginary relation itself. It follows that this action can never be purely <I>instrumental </I>; the men who would use an ideology purely as a means of action, as a tool, find that they have been caught by it, implicated by it, just when they are using it and believe themselves to be absolute masters of it. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This is perfectly clear in the case of a <I>class society.</I> The ruling ideology is then the ideology of the ruling <I>class.</I> But the ruling class does not maintain with the ruling ideology, which is its own ideology, an external and lucid relation of pure utility and cunning. When, during the eighteenth century, the 'rising class', the bourgeoisie, developed a humanist ideology of equality, freedom and reason, it gave its own demands the form of universality, since it hoped thereby to enroll at its side, by their education to this end, the very men it would liberate only for their exploitation. This is the Rousseauan myth of the origins of inequality: the rich holding forth to the poor in 'the most deliberate discourse' ever conceived, so as to persuade them to live their slavery as their freedom. In reality, the bourgeoisie has to believe in its own myth before it can convince others, and not only so as to convince others, since what it lives in its ideology is <I>the very relation</I> between it and its real conditions of existence which allows it simultaneously to act on itself (provide itself with a legal and ethical consciousness, and the legal and ethical conditions of economic liberalism) and on others (those it exploits and is going to exploit in the future: the 'free labourers') so as to take up, occupy and maintain its historical role as a ruling class. Thus, in a very exact sense, the bourgeoisie <I>lives</I> in the ideology of <I>freedom</I> the relation between it and its conditions of existence: that is, <I>its</I> real relation (the law of a liberal capitalist economy) <I>but invested in an imaginary relation</I> (all men are free, including the free labourers). Its ideology 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 235</B></FONT><P>

consists of this play on the word <I>freedom</I>, which betrays the bourgeois wish to mystify those ('free men'!) it exploits, blackmailing them with freedom so as to keep them in harness, as much as the bourgeoisie's need to <I>live</I> its own class rule as the freedom of those it is exploiting. Just as a people that exploits another cannot be free, so a class that <I>uses</I> an ideology is its captive too. So when we speak of the class function of an ideology it must be understood that the ruling ideology is indeed the ideology of the ruling class and that the former serves the latter not only in its rule over the exploited class, <I>but in its own constitution of itself as the ruling class</I>, by making it accept the lived relation between itself and the world as real and justified. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But, we must go further and ask what becomes of <I>ideology</I> in a society in which classes have disappeared. What we have just said allows us to answer this question. If the whole social function of ideology could be summed up cynically as a myth (such as Plato's 'beautiful lies' or the techniques of modern advertising) fabricated and manipulated from the outside by the ruling class to fool those it is exploiting, then ideology would disappear with classes. But as we have seen that even in the case of a class society ideology is active on the ruling class itself and contributes to its moulding, to the modification of its attitudes to adapt it to its real conditions of existence (for example, legal freedom) -- it is clear that <I>ideology</I> (<I>as a system of mass representations </I>) <I>is indispensable in any society if men are to be formed</I>, <I>transformed and equipped to respond to the demands of their conditions of existence.</I> If, as Marx said, history is a perpetual transformation of men's conditions of existence, and if this is equally true of a socialist society, then men must be ceaselessly transformed so as to adapt them to these conditions; if this 'adaptation' cannot be left to spontaneity but must be constantly assumed, dominated and controlled, it is in ideology that this demand is expressed, that this distance is measured, that this contradiction is lived and that its resolution is 'activated'. It is in ideology that the classless society <I>lives</I> the inadequacy/adequacy of the relation between it and the world, it is in it and by it that it transforms men's 'consciousness', that is, their attitudes and behaviour so as to raise them to the level of their tasks and the conditions of their existence. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In a class society ideology is the relay whereby, and the element 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 236</B></FONT><P>

in which, the relation between men and their conditions of existence is settled to the profit of the ruling class. In a classless society ideology is the relay whereby, and the element in which, the relation between men and their conditions of existence is lived to the profit of all men. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR>

<P>
We are now in a position to return to the theme of socialist humanism and to account for the theoretical disparity we observed between a scientific term (socialism) and an ideological one (humanism). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In its relations with the existing forms of bourgeois or Christian <I>personal</I> humanism, socialist personal humanism presents itself as an ideology precisely in the <I>play on words</I> that authorizes this meeting. I am far from thinking that this might be the meeting of a cynicism and a na&iuml;vety. In the case in point, the play on words is still the index of a <I>historical reality</I>, and simultaneously of lived ambiguity, and an expression of the desire to overcome it. When, in the relations between Marxists and everyone else, the former lay stress on a socialist personal humanism, they are simply demonstrating their <I>will</I> to bridge the gap that separates them from possible allies, and they are simply anticipating the movement, trusting to future history the task of providing the old words with a new content.


<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is this content that matters. For, once again, the themes of Marxist humanism are not, first of all, themes for the use of <I>others.</I> The Marxists who develop them necessarily do so <I>for themselves</I> before doing so for others. Now we know what these developments are based on: on the new conditions existing in the Soviet Union, on the end of the dictatorship of the proletariat and on the transition to communism. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   And this is where everything is at stake. This is how I should pose the question. <I>To what</I> in the Soviet Union does the manifest development of the themes of (socialist) personal humanism correspond? Speaking of the idea of man and of humanism in <I>The German Ideology</I>, Marx commented that the idea of human nature, or of the essence of man, concealed a <I>coupled value judgement</I>, 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 237</B></FONT><P>

to be precise, the couple human/inhuman; and he wrote: 'the "inhuman" as much as the "human" is a product of present conditions; it is their negative side'. The couple human/inhuman is the hidden principle of all humanism which is, then, no more than a way of living-sustaining-resolving this contradiction. Bourgeois humanism made man the principle of all theory. This luminous essence of man was the visible counterpart to a shadowy inhumanity. By this part of shade, the content of the human essence, that apparently absolute essence, announced its rebellious birth. The man of freedom-reason denounced the egoistic and divided man of capitalist society. In the two forms of this couple inhuman/human, the bourgeoisie of the eighteenth century lived in 'rational-liberal' form, the German left radical intellectuals in 'communalist' or 'communist' form, the relations between them and their conditions of existence, as a rejection, a demand and a programme. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What about contemporary socialist humanism? It is also a <I>rejection</I> and a denunciation: a rejection of all human discrimination, be it racial, political, religious or whatever. It is a rejection of all economic exploitation or political slavery. It is a rejection of war. This rejection is not just a proud proclamation of victory, an exhortation and example addressed to outsiders, to all men oppressed by Imperialism, by its exploitation, its poverty, its slavery, its discriminations and its wars: it is also and primarily turned <I>inwards </I>: to the Soviet Union itself. In personal socialist humanism, the Soviet Union accepts on its own account the supersession of the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, but it also rejects and condemns the 'abuses' of the latter, the aberrant and 'criminal' forms it took during the period of the 'cult of personality'. Socialist humanism, in its internal use, deals with the historical reality of the supersession of the dictatorship of the proletariat and of the 'abusive' forms it took in the U.S.S.R. It deals with a 'dual' reality: not only a reality superseded by the rational <I>necessity</I> of the development of the forces of production of socialist relations of production (the dictatorship of the proletariat) -- but also a reality which <I>ought not to have had to be superseded</I>, that new form of '<I>non-rational existence of reason </I>', that part of historical '<I>unreason </I>' and of the 'inhuman' that the past of the U.S.S.R. bears within it: terror, repression and dogmatism -- precisely what has not yet been completely superseded, in its effects or its misdeeds. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 238</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But with this wish we move from the shade to the light, from the inhuman to the human. The communism to which the Soviet Union is committed is a world without economic exploitation, without violence, without discrimination -- a world opening up before the Soviets the infinite vistas of progress, of science, of culture, of bread and freedom, of free development -- a world that can do without shadows or tragedies. Why then all this stress so deliberately laid on <I>man </I>? What need do the Soviets have for an <I>idea of man</I>, that is, an idea of themselves, <I>to help them live their history </I>? It is difficult here to avoid relating together the necessity to prepare and realize an important historical mutation (the transition to communism, the end of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the withering-away of the State apparatus, presupposing the creation of new forms of political, economic and cultural organization, corresponding to this transition) on the one hand -- and, on the other, the <I>historical conditions</I> in which this transition must be put into effect. Now it is obvious that <I>these conditions</I> too, bear the characteristic mark of the U.S.S.R.'s past and of its difficulties -- not only the mark of the difficulties due to the period of the '<I>cult of personality </I>', <I>but also</I> the mark of the more distant difficulties characteristic of the '<I>construction of socialism in one country </I>', and in addition in a country economically and culturally 'backward' to start with. Among these 'conditions', first place must be given to the 'theoretical' conditions inherited from the past. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The present disproportion of the historical tasks to their conditions explains the recourse to this ideology. In fact, the themes of socialist humanism designate the existence of real problems: <I>new</I> historical, economic, political and ideological problems that the Stalinist period kept in the shade, but still produced while producing socialism -- problems of the forms of economic, political and cultural <I>organization</I> that correspond to the level of development attained by socialism's productive forces; problems of the new form of <I>individual development</I> for a new period of history in which the State will no longer take charge, <I>coercively</I>, of the leadership or control of the destiny of each individual, in which from now on each man will <I>objectively</I> have <I>the choice</I>, that is, <I>the difficult task</I> of becoming by himself what he is. The themes of socialist humanism (free development of the individual, respect for socialist legality, dignity of the person, etc.) are the way the Soviets and other 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 239</B></FONT><P>

socialists are <I>living</I> the relation between themselves and these problems, that is, the <I>conditions</I> in which they are posed. It is striking to observe that, in conformity with the necessity of their development, in the majority of socialist democracies as in the Soviet Union, problems of politics and ethics have come to the fore and that for their part, Western parties, too, are obsessed with these problems. Now, it is not less striking to see that these problems are occasionally, if not frequently, dealt with <I>theoretically</I> by recourse to concepts derived from Marx's early period, from his philosophy of man: the concepts of alienation, fission, fetishism, the total man, etc. However, considered in themselves, these problems are basically problems that, far from calling for a 'philosophy of man', involve the preparation of new forms of <I>organization</I> for economic, political and ideological life (including new forms of individual development) in the socialist countries during the phase of the withering-away or supersession of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Why is it that these problems are posed by certain ideologues as a function of the concepts of a <I>philosophy of man</I> -- instead of being openly, fully and rigorously posed in the economic, political and ideological terms of Marxist theory? Why do so many Marxist philosophers seem to feel the need to appeal to the pre-Marxist ideological concept of <I>alienation</I> in order supposedly to think and 'resolve' these concrete historical problems? 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We would not observe the temptation of this ideological recourse if it were not in its own way the index of a necessity which cannot nevertheless take shelter in the protection of other, better established, forms of necessity. There can be no doubt that Communists are correct in opposing the economic, social, political and cultural <I>reality</I> of socialism to the 'inhumanity' of Imperialism in general; that this contrast is a part of the confrontation and struggle between socialism and imperialism. But it might be equally dangerous to use an ideological concept like humanism, with neither discrimination nor reserve, as if it were a theoretical concept, when it is inevitably charged with associations from the ideological unconsciousness and only too easily blends into themes of petty-bourgeois inspiration (we know that the petty bourgeoisie and its ideology, for which Lenin predicted a fine future, have not yet been buried by History). 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 240</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Here we are touching on a deeper reason, and one doubtless difficult to express. Within certain limits this recourse to ideology might indeed be envisaged as the substitute for a recourse to theory. Here again we would find the <I>theoretical conditions</I> currently inherited by Marxist theory from its past -- not just the dogmatism of the Stalinist period, but also, from further back, the heritage of the disastrously opportunist interpretations of the Second International which Lenin fought against throughout his life, but which have neither as yet been buried by History. These conditions have hindered the development which was indispensable if Marxist theory was to acquire precisely those concepts demanded by the new problems: concepts that would have allowed it to pose these problems today in scientific, not ideological terms; that would have allowed it to call things by their names, that is, by the appropriate Marxist concepts, rather than, as only too often happens, by ideological concepts (alienation) or by concepts without any definite status.

   For example, it is regrettable to observe that the concept by which Communists designate an important historical phenomenon in the history of the U.S.S.R. and of the workers' movement: the concept of the 'cult of personality' would be an 'absent', unclassifiable concept in Marxist theory if it were taken as a theoretical concept; it may well describe and condemn a mode of behaviour, and on these grounds, possess a doubly practical value, but, to my knowledge, Marx never regarded a mode of political behaviour as directly assimilable to a historical <I>category</I>, that is, to a <I>concept</I> from the theory of historical materialism: for if it does designate a reality, it is not its concept. However, everything that has been said of the 'cult of personality' refers exactly to the domain of the <I>superstructure</I> and therefore of State organization and ideologies; further it refers largely to <I>this domain alone</I>, which we know from Marxist theory possesses a 'relative autonomy' (which explains very simply, in theory, how the socialist <I>infrastructure</I> has been able to develop without essential damage during this period of errors affecting the superstructure). Why are existing, known and recognized Marxist concepts not invoked to think and situate this phenomenon, which is in fact described as a mode of behaviour and related to one man's 'psychology', that is, merely <I>described</I> but not thought? If one man's 'psychology' could take on this 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 241</B></FONT><P>

<I>historical</I> role, why not pose in Marxist terms the question of the historical conditions of the possibility of this apparent promotion of 'psychology' to the dignity and dimensions of a historical fact? Marxism contains in its principles the wherewithal to pose this problem in terms of theory, and hence the wherewithal to clarify it and help to resolve it. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   It is no accident that the two examples I have invoked are the concept of alienation and the concept of the 'cult of personality'. For the concepts of socialist humanism, too (in particular the problems of law and the person), have as their object problems arising in the domain of the superstructure: State organization, political life, ethics, ideologies, etc. And it is impossible to hold back the thought that the recourse to ideology is the shortest cut there too, a substitute for an insufficient theory. Insufficient, but latent and potential. Such is the role of this temptation of the recourse to ideology; to fill in this absence, this delay, this gap, without recognizing it openly, by making one's need and impatience a theoretical argument, as Engels put it, and by taking the need for a theory for the theory itself. The philosophical humanism which might easily become a threat to us and which shelters behind the unprecedented achievements of socialism itself, is this complement which, in default of theory, is destined to give certain Marxist ideologue the <I>feeling</I> of the theory that they lack; a feeling that cannot lay claim to that most precious of all the things Marx gave us -- the possibility of scientific knowledge. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   That is why, if today socialist humanism is on the agenda, the good reasons for this ideology can in no case serve as a caution against the bad ones, without dragging us into a confusion of ideology and scientific theory. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Marx's philosophical anti-humanism does provide an understanding of the necessity of existing ideologies, including humanism. But at the same time, because it is a critical and revolutionary theory, it also provides an understanding of the tactics to be adopted towards them; whether they should be supported, transformed or combated. And Marxists know that there can be no tactics that do not depend on a strategy -- and no strategy that does not depend on theory.

A Complementary Note on 'Real Humanism'
</FONT></B>
<P>

Just a word or two on the phrase 'real humanism'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="FM65ii.html#fnp242">1</A>]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   The specific difference lies in the adjective: <I>real.</I> Real-humanism is scientifically defined by its opposition to unreal humanism, ideal(ist), abstract, speculative humanism and so on. This <I>reference</I> humanism is simultaneously invoked as a reference and rejected for its abstraction, unreality, etc., by the new real-humanism. So the old humanism is judged by the new as an abstract and illusory humanism. Its illusion is to aim at an unreal object, to have as its content an object which is not the real object. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Real humanism presents itself as the humanism that has as its content not an abstract speculative object, but a real object. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But this definition remains a negative one: it is sufficient to express the rejection of a certain content, but it does not provide the new content as such. The content aimed at by real-humanism is not in the concepts of humanism or 'real' as such, but outside these concepts. The adjective real is <I>gestural </I>; it points out that to find the content of this new humanism you must look in <I>reality</I> -- in society, the State, etc. So the concept of real-humanism is linked to the concept of humanism as its theoretical reference, but it is opposed to it through its rejection of the latter's abstract object -- and by providing a concrete, real, object. The word <I>real</I> plays a dual role. It shows up the idealism and abstraction in the old humanism (negative function of the concept of reality); and at the same time it designates the <I>external reality</I> (external to the old humanism) in which the new humanism will find its content (positive function of the concept of reality). However, this positive function of the word 'real' is not a positive function of <I>knowledge</I>, it is a positive function of <I>practical gesture.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   What, indeed, is this 'reality' which is to transform the old humanism into real-humanism? It is society. The Sixth Thesis on

1. The concept of 'real-humanism' sustains the argument of an article by Jorge Semprun published in <I>Clart&eacute;</I>, no. 58 (see <I>Nouvelle Critique</I>, no. 164, March 1965). It is a concept borrowed from Marx's Early Works. 
</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 243</B></FONT><P>

Feuerbach goes so far as to say that the non-abstract 'man' is 'the ensemble of the social relations'. Now if we take this phrase literally as an adequate definition <I>it means nothing at all.</I> Try and give it a literal explication and you will see that there is no way out without recourse to a periphrasis of the following kind: 'If anyone wants to know what reality is, not the reality corresponding adequately to the concept of man, or of humanism, but the reality which is directly at issue in these concepts, it is not an abstract essence but the ensemble of the social relations.' This periphrasis immediately highlights the <I>inadequacy</I> of the concept of man to its definition: the ensemble of the social relations. Between these two terms (man/ensemble of the social relations) there is, doubtless, some relation, but it is not legible in the definition, <I>it is not a relation of definition</I>, <I>not a relation of knowledge.</I> 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But this inadequacy has a meaning, this relation has a meaning: a <I>practical</I> meaning. This inadequacy manifestly designates an <I>action to be achieved</I>, a <I>displacement</I> to be put into effect. It means that to find the reality alluded to by seeking abstract man no longer but real man instead, it is necessary <I>to turn to society</I>, and to undertake an analysis of the ensemble of the social relations. In the phrase real-humanism, in my opinion, the concept 'real' is a practical concept, the equivalent of a <I>signal</I>, of a notice-board that 'points out' what movement is to be put into effect and in what direction, to what place, must there be <I>displacement</I> to reach the real earth rather than the heaven of abstraction. 'The real this way!' We follow this <I>guide</I> and we come out into society, the social relations, and the conditions of their real possibility. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But it is then that the shocking paradox appears: once this <I>displacement</I> has really been put into effect, once the scientific analysis of this real object has been undertaken, we discover that a knowledge of concrete (real) men, that is, a knowledge of the ensemble of the social relations is only possible on condition that we do completely without the <I>theoretical services</I> of the concept of man (in the sense in which it existed in its theoretical claims even before the displacement). In fact, this concept seems to me to be useless from a scientific viewpoint, not because it is abstract!  --  but because it is not scientific. To think the reality of society, of the ensemble of social relations, we must put into effect a radical <I>displacement</I>, not only a spatial displacement (from the abstract 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 244</B></FONT><P>

to the concrete) but also a conceptual displacement (we change our basic concepts!). The concepts whereby Marx thought reality, which real-humanism pointed out, never ever again introduce as <I>theoretical</I> concepts the concepts of man or humanism; but other, quite new concepts, the concepts of mode of production, forces of production, relations of production, superstructure, ideology, etc. This is the paradox: the practical concept that pointed out for us the destination of the displacement has been consumed in the displacement itself, the concept that pointed out for us the site for investigation is from now on absent from the investigation itself. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This is a characteristic phenomenon of the <I>transitions-breaks</I> that constitute the advent of a new problematic. At certain moments in the history of ideas we see these <I>practical concepts</I> emerge, and typically they are <I>internally unbalanced</I> concepts. In one aspect they belong to the old ideological universe which serves as their 'theoretical' reference (humanism); but in the other they concern a new domain, pointing out the <I>displacement</I> to be put into effect to get to it. In the first aspect they retain a 'theoretical' meaning (the meaning in their universe of reference); in the second their only meaning is as a <I>practical</I> signal, pointing out a direction and a destination, but without giving an adequate concept of it. We still remain in the domain of the earlier ideology; we are approaching its frontier and a signpost points out to us a beyond, a direction and a destination.' Cross the frontier and go on in the direction of society and you will find the real.' The signpost is still standing in the ideological domain, <I>the message is written in its language</I>, even if it does use 'new' words, even the rejection of ideology is written in ideological language, as we see so strikingly in Feuerbach; the 'concrete', the 'real', these are the names that the opposition to ideology bears in ideology. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   You can stay indefinitely at the frontier line, ceaselessly repeating concrete! concrete! real! real! This is what Feuerbach did, and Feuerbach, too, spoke of society and State, and never stopped talking about real man, man with needs, concrete man, who is merely the ensemble of his developed human needs, of politics and industry. He stayed with the words which in their concreteness itself referred him to the image of man whose <I>realization</I> he called for (Feuerbach, too, said that real man is society, in a defi- 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 245</B></FONT><P>

nition <I>then adequate</I> to its concept, since society was for him in each of its historical moments never more than the progressive manifestation of the <I>human essence </I>). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Or, on the contrary, you can cross the frontier for good and penetrate into the domain of reality and embark 'seriously on its study', as Marx puts it in <I>The German Ideology.</I> Then the signal will have played its practical part. It remains in the old domain, in the domain <I>abandoned</I> by the very fact of <I>displacement.</I> There you are face to face with your real object, obliged to forge the requisite and adequate concepts, to think it, obliged to accept the fact that the old concepts and in particular the concept of real-man or real humanism will not allow you to <I>think the reality of man</I>, that to reach this immediacy, which is precisely not an immediacy, it is necessary, as always where knowledge is concerned, to make a long detour. You have abandoned the old domain, the old concepts. Here you are in a new domain, for which new concepts will give you the knowledge. The sign that a real change in locus and problematic has occurred, and that a new adventure is beginning, the adventure of science in development. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   So are we condemned to repeat the same experience? Real humanism may today be the <I>slogan</I> of a rejection and a programme and thus in the best of cases a <I>practical</I> signal, the rejection of an abstract 'humanism' which only existed in the discourse and not in the reality of institutions -- and the gesture towards a beyond, a reality which is still <I>beyond</I>, which is not yet truly <I>realized</I>, but only hoped for, the programme of an aspiration to be brought to life. It is only too clear that profound rejections and authentic wishes, as well as an impatient desire to overcome still unconquered obstacles, are, in their own way, translated in this concept of real humanism. It is also certain that in every epoch of history men must make their own experiments on their own account, and it is no accident that some of them retrace the 'paths' taken by their elders and ancestors. It is certainly indispensable that Communists should take seriously the real meaning concealed in this wish, the realities for which this practical concept is an index. It is certainly indispensable that Communists should pass to and fro between the still uncertain, confused and ideological forms in which this wish or some new experiment are expressed -- and their own theoretical concepts; that they should, when the need has been 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 247</B></FONT><P>

absolutely proved, forge new theoretical concepts adequate to the upheavals of practice in our own time. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   But we should not forget that the frontier separating ideology from scientific theory was crossed about one hundred and twenty years ago by Marx; that this great undertaking and this great discovery have been recorded in the works and inscribed in the conceptual system of a knowledge whose effects have little by little transformed the face of the earth and its history. We cannot and must not for one instant renounce the benefits of this irreplaceable gain, the benefits of these theoretical resources which far transcend in wealth and potential the use that has so far been made of them. We must not forget that an understanding of what is going on in the world today and the political and ideological interchange indispensable to the broadening and reinforcement of the base of socialism are only possible if, for our part, we do not fall <I>behind</I> what Marx gained for us, as far behind as that still uncertain frontier between ideology and science. We can give help to all those who are near to crossing that frontier, but only on condition that we have crossed it ourselves, and have inscribed in our concepts the irreversible result of this change of scene. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   For us, the 'real' is not a <I>theoretical slogan </I>; the real is the real object that exists independently of its knowledge -- but which can only be defined by its knowledge. In this second, theoretical, relation, the real is identical to the means of knowing it, the real is its known or to-be-known structure, it is the very object of Marxist theory, the object marked out by the great theoretical discoveries of Marx and Lenin, the immense, living, constantly developing field, in which the events of human history can from now on be mastered by men's practice, because they will be within their conceptual grasp, their knowledge. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This is what I meant when I demonstrated that real-humanism or socialist humanism may be the object of a recognition or of a misunderstanding, according to the status assigned it in respect to theory; that it can serve as a <I>practical</I>, <I>ideological</I> slogan in so far as it is exactly adequate to its function and not confused with a quite different function; that there is no way in which it can abrogate the attributes of a <I>theoretical</I> concept. I also meant that this slogan is not itself its own light, but can at most point out the <I>place</I>, <I>beyond it</I>, where light reigns. I meant that a certain <I>inflation</I> 

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 247</B></FONT><P>

of this practical, ideological concept might induce Marxist theory to fall behind its own frontiers; and what is more, might even hinder, if not bar, the way to truly <I>posing</I>, and hence truly solving, the problems whose existence and urgency it is intended to designate, in its own way. Simply put, the recourse to ethics so deeply inscribed in every humanist ideology may play the part of an imaginary treatment of real problems. <I>Once known</I>, these problems are posed in precise terms; they are organizational problems of the forms of economic life, political life and individual life. To pose these problems correctly and to resolve them in reality, they must be called by their names, <I>their scientific names.</I> The slogan of humanism has no theoretical value, but it does have value as a practical index: we must get down to the concrete problems themselves, that is, to their knowledge, if we are to produce the historical transformation whose necessity was thought by Marx. We must be careful that in this process no <I>word</I>, justified by its practical function, usurps a theoretical function; but that in performing its practical function, it simultaneously disappears from the field of theory.

Marx derived the term from Feuerbach's anthropology where it

which, although man created it in the image of his essence
(the species-being), ap- pears to him as an external,

claim to be Marxists, reject the classical Marxist
distinction between historical and dialectical materialism
since they see philosophy as the self-knowledge of the
historical process, and hence identify philosophy and the
science of history; at best, dialectical materialism is
reduced to the historical method, while the science of
history is its content. Althusser, rejecting historicism,
rejects this identification. For him, historical materialism
is the science of history, while dialectical materialism,
Marxist philosophy, is the theory of scientific practice

the theory introduced by Engels and much elaborated by Mao
Tse-tung that economic, political and ideological practice
are the three practices (processes of production or
transformation) that constitute the social form- ation
(q.v.). Economic practice is the transformation of nature<BR> by
human labour into social products, political practice the
transformation of social relations by revolution,
ideological practice the transformation of one relation to
the lived world into a new relation by ideological struggle.
In his concern to stress the distinction between science and
ideology (q.v.), Al- thusser insists that theory constitutes a
fourth practice, the- oretical practice, that transforms
ideology into knowledge with theory. The determinant moment
in each practice is the work of production which brings
together raw materials, men and means of production -- <I>not</I>
the men who perform the work, who cannot therefore claim to
be the subjects of the historical process. Subsidiary
practices are also discussed by Althusser, e.g. technical
practice (<I>pratique technique </I>).<BR>

<P>criticize an ideological and political tendency in the Russian
Social-Democratic movement that held that the revolutionary
movement should base itself on the 'spontaneous' action of
the working class rather than trying to lead it by imposing
on this action, by means of a party, policies produced by
the party's theoretical work. [For Lenin, the real
spontaneity, capacity for action, inventiveness and so on,
of the 'masses', was to be re- spected as <I>the most precious</I>
aspect of the workers' movement: but at the same time Lenin
condemned the 'ideology of sponta- neity' (a dangerous
ideology) shared by his opponents (populists and 'Socialist
Revolutionaries'), and recognized that the <I>real</I> spontaneity
of the masses was to be sustained and criticized<BR> in the mean
time in order to 'liberate' it from the influence of
bourgeois ideology. L. A.]. In this sense, Lenin argued
that to<BR> make <I>concessions</I> to 'spontaneity' was to hand the
revolution- ary movement over to the power of bourgeois
ideology, and<BR> hence to the counter-revolution. Althusser
generalizes this by arguing that each practice (q.v.) and
its corresponding science must not be left to develop on
their own, however successful<BR> they may temporarily be, since
to do so leaves the field open<BR> for an ideology
(characteristically pragmatism) to seize hold<BR> of the
science, and for the counter-revolution to seize the
practice. The 'unity of theory and practice' cannot be the
sim-<BR> ple unity of a reflection, it is the complex one of an
epistemo- logical break (q.v.) [in theory. In <I>political</I>
practice this unity takes another form (not examined in this

<P>Althusser theory is a specific, scientific theoretical
practice (q.v.). In Chapter 6 '<A HREF="http://marx2mao.phpwebhosting.com/Other/PROMLEM">On the Materialist

inverted commas), the deter-<BR>minate theoretical system of a
given science, and Theory (with<BR> a capital T), the theory of
practice in general, i.e. dialectical<BR> materialism (q.v.).
[In a few words in the preface to the Italian translation of
<I>Lire le Capital</I>, reproduced in the new French ed- ition of the
book, and to be published in the English translation (New
Left Books), I have pointed out that I now regard my
def- inition of philosophy (Theory as 'the Theory of
theoretical prac- tice') as a unilateral and, in consequence,
<I>false</I> conception of dialectical materialism. Positive
indications of the new defini- tion I propose can be found:
(1) in an interview published in <I>L'Unit&agrave;</I> in February
1968 and reproduced in the Italian trans- lation of <I>Lire le
Capital</I> (Feltrinelli) and in <I>La Pens&eacute;e</I> (April 1968);
2) in <I>L&eacute;nine et la philosophie</I>, the text of a lecture
I<BR> gave to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de
Philosophie in February 1968, and published under the same
title by Fran&ccedil;ois Maspero in Jan- uary 1969. The new
definition of philosophy can be resumed in three points: (1)
philosophy 'represents' the class struggle in the<BR> realm of
<I>theory</I>, hence philosophy is neither a science, nor a<BR> pure
theory (Theory), but a <I>political practice of intervention</I> in
the realm of theory; (2) philosophy 'represents'
scientificity in the realm of political practice, hence
philosophy is not <I>the</I> political practice, but a theoretical
practice of intervention in the realm of politics; (3)
philosophy is an original 'instance' (differing from the
instances of <I>science</I> and <I>poli-tics </I>) that represents the one
instance alongside (<I>aupr&egrave;s de </I>) the other, in the form
of a specific intervention (political-theoretical). L. A.].<BR>

<I>A Letter to the Translator</I>
<P>
Thank you for your glossary; what you have done in it is <I>extremely</I> important from a political, educational and theoretical point of view. I offer you my warmest thanks. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I return your text with a whole series of corrections and interpolations (some of which are fairly long and important, you will see why). 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   A minor point: you refer twice to Foucault and once to Canguilhem <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> my use of 'break' and, I think, of 'problematic'. I should like to point out that Canguilhem has lived and thought in close contact with the work of Bachelard for many years, so it is not surprising if he refers somewhere to the term 'epistemological break', although this term is rarely to be found as such in Bachelard's texts (on the other hand, if the term is uncommon, the <I>thing</I> is there all the time from a certain point on in Bachelard's work). But Canguilhem has not used this concept <I>systematically</I>, as I have tried to do. As for Foucault, the uses he explicitly or implicitly makes of the concepts 'break' and 'problematic' are echoes either of Bachelard, or of my own systematic 'use' of Bachelard (as far as 'break' is concerned) and of what I owe to my unfortunate friend Martin (for 'problematic'). I am not telling you this out of 'author's pride' (it means nothing to me), but out of respect both for the authors referred to and for the readers. 

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   As for these authors: <I>Canguilhem </I>'s use of the concept 'break' differs from mine, although his interpretation does tend in the same direction. In fact, this should be put the other way round: <I>my debt to Canguilhem is incalculable</I>, and it is my interpretation that tends in the direction of his, as it is a <I>continuation</I> of his, going beyond the point where his has (for the time being) stopped. <I>Foucault </I>: his case is quite different. He was a pupil of mine, and 'something' from my writings has passed into his, including certain of my formulations. But (and it must be said, concerning as it does his own philosophical personality) under his pen and in his thought even the meanings he gives to formulations he has borrowed from me are transformed into another quite different meaning than my own. Please take these corrections into account; I entrust them to you in so far as they may enlighten the English reader

   Much more important are the corrections I have suggested for some of your rubrics. In most cases they are merely <I>corrections</I> (precisions) which do not affect the state of the theoretical concepts that figure in the book (<I>For Marx </I>). They cast a little more light on what you yourself have very judiciously clarified. But in other cases they are corrections of a different kind: bearing on a certain point in Lenin's thought, for example (my interpolation on the question of spontaneity). And finally, in other cases (see my last interpolation), I have tried to give some hints to guide the English reader in the road I have travelled since the (now quite distant) publication of the articles that make up <I>For Marx.</I> You will understand why I am so <I>insistent</I> on all these corrections and interpolations. I urge you to give them a place in your glossary, and add that (1) I have myself gone over the text of the glossary line by line, and (2) I have made changes in matters of detail (which need not be indicated) and a few <I>important interpolations.</I>

   As a result, everything should be perfectly dear. And we shall have removed the otherwise inevitable snare into which readers of 1969 would certainly have 'fallen', if they were allowed to believe that the author of texts that appeared one by one between 1960 and 1965 has <I>remained in the position</I> of these old articles whereas time has not ceased to pass. . . . You can easily imagine the theoretical, ideological and political misunderstandings that could not but have arisen from this 'fiction', and how much time and effort would have had to be deployed to 'remove' these misunderstandings. The procedure I suggest has the advantage that it removes any misunderstanding of this kind <I>in advance</I>, since, <I>on the one hand</I>, I leave the system of concepts of 1960 to 1965 as it was, while <I>on the other</I>, I indicate the <I>essential point</I> in which I have developed in the intervening years -- since, <I>finally</I>, I give <I>references</I> to the new writings that contain the new definition of philosophy that I now hold, and I summarize the <I>new conception</I> which I have arrived at (provisionally -- but what is not provisional?).
