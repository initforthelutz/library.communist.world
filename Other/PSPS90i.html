These reflections are designed to present, in as clear and systematic a form as possible, the theoretical principles that found and guide the practice of Communists in the domain of theory and ideology.

1.&nbsp;Marxism is a Scientific Doctrine
</B>

<P>
A famous title of Engels's underscores the essential distinction between Marxism and previous socialist doctrines: before Marx, socialist doctrines were merely <I>utopian </I>; Marx's doctrine is <I>scientific.</I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp3">1</A>]</FONT> What is a <I>utopian</I> socialist doctrine? It is a doctrine which proposes <I>socialist</I> goals for human action, yet which is based on non-scientific principles, deriving from religious, moral or juridical, i.e. <I>ideological</I>, principles. The ideological nature of its theoretical foundation is decisive, because it affects how any socialist doctrine conceives of not only the ends of socialism, but also the <I>means</I> of action required to realize these ends. Thus, utopian socialist doctrine defines the <I>ends of socialism</I> - the socialist society of the future - by moral and juridical categories; it speaks of the reign of equality and the brotherhood of man; and it translates these moral and legal principles into utopian - that is, ideological, ideal and imaginary - economic principles as well: for example, the complete sharing-out of the products of labour among the workers, economic egalitarianism, the negation of all economic law, the immediate disappearance of the State, etc. In the same manner it defines utopian, ideological and imaginary <I>economic and political means</I> as the appropriate means to realize socialism: in the economic domain, the workers' co-operatives of Owen, the phalanstery of Fourier's disciples, Proudhon's people's bank; in the political domain, moral education and reform - if not the Head of State's conversion to socialism. In constructing an ideological representation of the <I>ends</I> as well as the <I>means</I> of socialism, utopian socialist doctrines are, as Marx clearly showed, prisoners of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois economic, juridical, moral and political principles. That is why they cannot really break with the

bourgeois system, they cannot be genuinely revolutionary. They remain <I>anarchist</I> or <I>reformist.</I> Content, in fact, to oppose the bourgeois politico-economic system with bourgeois (moral, juridical) principles, they are trapped - whether they like it or not - within the bourgeois system. They can never break out towards revolution. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Marxist doctrine, by contrast, is <I>scientific.</I> This means that it is not content to apply existing bourgeois moral and juridical principles (liberty, equality, fraternity, justice, etc.) to the existing bourgeois reality in order to criticize it, but that it criticizes these existing bourgeois moral and juridical principles, as well as the existing politico-economic system. Thus its general critique rests on other than existing ideological principles (religious, moral and juridical); it rests on the <I>scientific knowledge</I> of the totality of the existing bourgeois system, its politico-economic as well as its ideological systems. It rests on the knowledge of this ensemble, which constitutes an organic totality of which the economic, political, and ideological are organic 'levels' or 'instances', articulated with each other according to specific laws. It is this <I>knowledge</I> that allows us to define the objectives of socialism, and to conceive socialism as a new determinate mode of production which will succeed the capitalist mode of production, to conceptualize its specific determinations, the precise form of its relations of production, its political and ideological superstructure. It is this knowledge that permits us to define the appropriate <I>means of action</I> for 'making the revolution', means based upon the nature of historical necessity and historical development, on the determinant role of the economy in the last instance on this development, on the decisive role of class struggle in socioeconomic transformations, and on the role of consciousness and organization in political struggle. It is the application of these scientific principles that has led to the definition of the working class as the only radically revolutionary class, the definition of the forms of organization appropriate to the economic and political struggle (role of the unions; nature and role of the party comprised of the vanguard of the working class) - the definition, finally, of the forms of ideological struggle. It is the application of these scientific principles that has made possible the break not only with the <I>reformist objectives</I> of utopian socialist doctrines, but also with <I>their forms of organization and struggle.</I> It is the application of these scientific principles that has allowed the definition of a revolutionary tactics and strategy whose irreversible first results are henceforth inscribed in world history, and continue to change the world.

foundation for this science, and to indicate the path that must be followed in further developing and elaborating it in all its parts. It disclosed the nature of modern capitalist economy by explaining how the hire of labour, the purchase of labour-power, conceals the enslavement of millions of propertyless people by a handful of capitalists, the owners of the land, factories, mines, and so forth. It showed that all modern capitalist development displays the tendency of large-scale production to eliminate petty production and creates conditions that make a socialist system of society possible and necessary. It taught us how to discern - beneath the pall of rooted customs, political intrigues, abstruse laws, and intricate doctrines - the <I>class struggle</I>, the struggle between the propertied classes in all their variety and the propertyless mass, the <I>proletariat</I>, which is at the head of all the propertyless. It made clear the real task of a revolutionary socialist party: not to draw up plans for refashioning society, not to preach to the capitalists and their hangers-on about improving the lot of the workers, not to hatch conspiracies, <I>but to organize the class struggle of the proletariat and to lead this struggle</I>, <I>the ultimate aim of which is the conquest of political power by the proletariat and the organization of a socialist society.</I>[2]

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Marxist scientific doctrine presents the specific peculiarity of being composed of <I>two scientific disciplines</I>, united for reasons of principle but actually distinct from one another because their objects are distinct: historical materialism and dialectical materialism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <I>Historical materialism is the science of history.</I> We can define it more precisely as the <I>science of modes of production</I>, their specific structure, their constitution, their functioning, and the forms of transition whereby one mode of production passes into another. <I>Capital</I> represents the scientific theory of the capitalist mode of production. Marx did not provide a developed theory of other modes of production - that of primitive communities, the slave, 'Asiatic', 'Germanic', feudal, socialist, and Communist modes of production - but only some clues, some outlines of these modes of production. Nor did Marx furnish a theory of the forms of transition from one determinate mode of production to another, only some clues and outlines. The most developed of these outlines concerns the forms of transition from the feudal to the capitalist mode of production (the section of <I>Capital</I> devoted to primitive accumulation, and numerous other passages). We also possess some precious, if rare, indications concerning aspects of the forms of transition from the capitalist to the socialist mode of production (in particular, the 'Critique of the Gotha Programme', where Marx insists on the phase of the dictatorship of the proletariat). The first phase of these forms of transition is the object of numerous reflections by Lenin (<I>State and Revolution</I>, and all his texts of the revolutionary and post-revolutionary period). In fact, the scientific knowledge in these texts directly governs all economic, political and ideological action directed towards the 'construction of socialism'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  A further clarification is necessary concerning historical materialism. The theory of history - a theory of the different modes of production - is, by all rights, the science of the organic totality that every social formation arising from a determinate mode of production constitutes. Now, as Marx showed, every social totality comprises the articulated ensemble of the different levels of this totality: the economic infrastructure, the politico-juridical superstructure, and the ideological superstructure. The theory of history, or historical materialism, is the theory of the specific nature of this totality - of the set of its levels, and of the type of articulation and determination that unifies them and forms the basis both of their dependence <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> the economic level - '<I>determinant in the last instance </I>' - and their degree of '<I>relative autonomy' </I>. It is because each of these levels possesses this 'relative autonomy' that it can be objectively considered as a '<I>partial whole </I>', and become the object of a relatively independent scientific treatment. This is why, taking account of this 'relative autonomy', one can legitimately

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 7</B></FONT><P>

study the economic 'level', or the political 'level', or this or that ideological, philosophical, aesthetic or scientific formation of a given mode of production, separately. This specification is very important, because it is the basis of the possibility of a theory of the history (relatively autonomous, and of a degree of variable autonomy according to the case) of the levels or the respective realities - a theory of the history of politics, for example, or of philosophy, art, the sciences, etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This is also the basis of a relatively autonomous theory of the 'economic level' of a given mode of production. <I>Capital</I>, as it is offered to us in its incompleteness (Marx also wanted to analyse the law, the State, and the ideology of the capitalist mode of production therein), precisely represents the scientific analysis of the <I>'economic level' of the capitalist mode of production </I>; this is why <I>Capital</I> is generally and correctly considered as, above all, the theory of the <I>economic system</I> of the capitalist mode of production. But as this theory of the economic 'level' of the capitalist mode of production necessarily presupposes, if not a developed theory, at least some adequate theoretical elements for other 'levels' of the capitalist mode of production (the juridico-political and ideological levels), <I>Capital</I> is not limited to the 'economy' alone. It far exceeds the economy, in accordance with the Marxist conception of the reality of the economy, which can be understood in its concept, defined and analysed only as a level, a part, a partial whole organically inscribed in the totality of the mode of production under consideration. This is why one finds in <I>Capital</I> fundamental theoretical elements for the elaboration of a theory of the other levels (political, ideological) of the capitalist mode of production. These elements are certainly undeveloped, but adequate for guiding us in the theoretical study of the other levels. In the same way one finds in <I>Capital</I>, even as it proposes to analyse only 'the capitalist mode of production', theoretical elements concerning the knowledge of other modes of production, and of the forms of transition between different modes of production - elements that are certainly undeveloped, but adequate for guiding us in the theoretical study of these matters. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Such, very schematically presented, is the nature of the first of the two sciences founded by Marx: historical materialism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In founding this science of history, at the same time Marx founded another scientific discipline: <I>dialectical materialism</I>, or <I>Marxist philosophy.</I> Yet here there appears a <I>de facto</I> difference. Whereas Marx was able to develop historical materialism very considerably, he was not able to do the same for <I>dialectical materialism</I>, or <I>Marxist philosophy.</I> He was able only to lay its foundations, either in rapid sketches (<I><A HREF="http://marx2mao.phpwebhosting.com/Other/TF45.html">Theses on Feuerbach</A> </I>) or in polemical texts (<I>The German Ideology</I>, <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/PP47.html">The Poverty of Philosophy</A> </I>), or again in a very dense methodological text 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 8</B></FONT><P>

(the unpublished <A HREF="../M&amp;E/PI.html">Introduction</A> to the <I>Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</I>, 1857) and in some passages of <I>Capital</I> (particularly the Postface to the second German edition). It was the demands of the ideological struggle on the terrain of philosophy that led Engels (<I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/AD78.html">Anti-D&uuml;hring</A></I>, <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/LF86.html">Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy</A> </I>) and Lenin (<I><A HREF="../Lenin/MEC08NB.html">Materialism and Empirio-criticism</A></I>, <I>Philosophical Notebooks</I>, the latter unpublished by Lenin) to develop at greater length the principles of dialectical materialism outlined by Marx. Yet none of these texts, not even those by Engels and Lenin - which are also, essentially, polemical or interpretative texts (Lenin's <I>Notebooks </I>) - displays a degree of elaboration and systematicity - and hence scientificity - in the least comparable to the degree of elaboration of historical materialism that we possess in Capital. As in the case of historical materialism, it is necessary carefully to distinguish between what has been given to us and what has not, so as to take stock of what remains to be done 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <I>Dialectical materialism</I>, <I>or Marxist philosophy</I>, <I>is a scientific discipline distinct from historical materialism.</I> The distinction between these two scientific disciplines rests on the distinction between their <I>objects.</I> The object of historical materialism is constituted by the modes of production, their constitution and their transformation. The object of dialectical materialism is constituted by what Engels calls '<I>the history of thought </I>', or what Lenin calls the history of the '<I>passage from ignorance to knowledge </I>', or what we can call the history of the production of knowledges - or yet again, the historical difference between ideology and science, or the specific difference of scientificity - all problems that broadly cover the domain called by classical philosophy the '<I>theory of knowledge'.</I> Of course, this theory can no longer be, as it was in classical philosophy, a theory of the formal, atemporal conditions of knowledge, a theory of the cogito (Descartes, Husserl), a theory of the a priori forms of the human mind (Kant), or a theory of absolute knowledge (Hegel). From the perspective of Marxist theory, it can only be a <I>theory of the history of knowledge</I> - that is, of the real conditions (material and social on the one hand, internal to scientific practice on the other) of the <I>process of production of knowledge.</I> The 'theory of knowledge', thus understood, constitutes the heart of Marxist philosophy. Studying the real conditions of the specific practice that produces knowledges, Marxist philosophical theory is necessarily led to define the nature of non-scientific or pre-scientific practices, the practices of ideological 'ignorance' (ideological practice), and all the real practices upon which scientific practice is founded and to which it is related - the practice of the transformation of social relations, or political practice; and the practice of the transformation of nature, or economic practice. This last practice puts man in relation to nature, which is the material condition

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 9</B></FONT><P>

of his biological and social existence. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Like any scientific discipline, Marxist philosophy presents itself in two forms: a <I>theory</I> which expresses the rational system of its theoretical concepts; and a <I>method</I> which expresses the relation the theory maintains with its object in its application to that object. Of course, theory and method are deeply united, constituting but two sides of the same reality: the scientific discipline in its very life. But it is important to distinguish them, in order to avoid either a dogmatic interpretation (pure theory) or a methodological interpretation (pure method) of dialectical materialism. In dialectical materialism, it can very schematically be said that it is <I>materialism</I> which represents the aspect of <I>theory</I>, and <I>dialectics</I> which represents the aspect of <I>method.</I> But each of these terms includes the other. <I>Materialism</I> expresses the effective conditions of the practice that produces knowledge - specifically: (1) the <I>distinction between the real and its knowledge</I> (distinction of reality), correlative of a correspondence (adequacy) between knowledge and its object (correspondence of knowledge); and (2) <I>the primacy of the real over its knowledge</I>, <I>or the primacy of being over thought.</I> None the less, these principles themselves are not 'eternal' principles, but the principles of the <I>historical nature of the process in which knowledge is produced.</I> That is why materialism is called <I>dialectical </I>: dialectics, which expresses the relation that theory maintains with its object, expresses this relation not as a relation of two simply distinct terms but as a relation within a process of transformation, thus of real production. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This is what is affirmed when it is said that dialectics is the law of transformation, the law of the development of real processes (natural and social processes, as well as the process of knowledge). It is in this sense that the Marxist dialectic can only be <I>materialist</I>, because it does not express the law of a pure imaginary or thought process but the law of real processes, which are certainly distinct and 'relatively autonomous' according to the level of reality considered, but which are all ultimately based on the processes of material nature. That Marxist materialism is necessarily dialectical is what distinguishes it from all previous <I>materialist</I> philosophies. That Marxist dialectics is necessarily materialist is what distinguishes the Marxist dialectic from all idealist dialects, particularly Hegelian dialectics. Whatever historical connections might be invoked between Marxist materialism and anterior 'metaphysical' or mechanical materialisms, on the one hand, and between Marxist and Hegelian dialectics, on the other, there exists a fundamental difference in kind between Marxist philosophy and all other philosophies. In founding dialectical materialism, Marx accomplished as revolutionary a work in philosophy as he effected in the domain of history by founding historical materialism.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 10</B></FONT><P>

3.&nbsp;Problems Posed by the Existence of these Two Disciplines
</B>

<P>
The existence of these two scientific disciplines - historical materialism and dialectical materialism - raises two questions: (1) Why did the foundation of historical materialism necessarily entail the foundation of dialectical materialism? (2) What is the proper function of dialectical materialism?

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   1.&nbsp;Very schematically, it can be said that the foundation of historical materialism, or the science of history, necessarily provoked the foundation of dialectical materialism for the following reason. We know that in the history of human thought, the foundation of an important new science has always more or less overtumed and renewed existing philosophy. This applies to Greek mathematics, which to a great extent provoked the recasting that led to Platonic philosophy; to modem physics, which provoked the recastings that led first to the philosophy of Descartes (after Galileo), then of Kant (after Newton); and also to the invention of infinitesimal calculus, which to a great extent provoked Leibniz's philosophical recasting, and the mathematical logic that put Husserl on the road to his system of Transcendental Phenomenology. We can say that the same process occurred with Marx, and that the foundation of the science of history induced the foundation of a new philosophy. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We must go further, however, to show how Marxist philosophy occupies a privileged place in the history of philosophy, and how it has transformed philosophy from the condition of an <I>ideology</I> into a <I>scientific discipline.</I> In fact, Marx was in some sense <I>compelled</I>, by an implacable logic, to found a radically new philosophy, because he was the first to have thought scientifically the <I>reality of history</I>, which all other philosophies were incapable of doing. Thinking the reality of history scientifically, Marx was obliged, and able, to situate and treat philosophies - for the first time - as realities which, while aiming for 'truth', while speaking of the conditions of knowledge, belong none the less to history, not only because they are conditioned by it but also because they play a social role in it. Whether idealist or materialist, classical philosophies were incapable of thinking about their own history: either the simple fact that they appeared at a determinate moment in history; or, what is much more important, the fact that they have an entire history behind them and are produced in large part by this <I>past history</I>, <I>by the relation of properly philosophical history to the history of the sciences and the other social practices.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Once a genuine knowledge of history had finally been produced, philosophy could no longer ignore, repress or sublimate its relation to

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 11</B></FONT><P>

history; it had to take account of, and think about, this relation. By means of a theoretical revolution it had to become a new philosophy, capable of thinking - in philosophy itself - its real relation to history, as well as its relation to the truth. The old philosophies of consciousness, of the transcendental subject - just like the dogmatic philosophies of absolute knowledge - were no longer possible philosophically. A new philosophy was necessary, one capable of thinking the <I>historical insertion</I> of philosophy in history, its real relation to scientific and social practices (political, economic, ideological), while taking account of the <I>knowledge-relation</I> it maintains with its object. It is this theoretical necessity that gave birth to dialectical materialism, the only philosophy that treats knowledge as the historical process of production of knowledges and that reflects its new object at once within materialism and within dialectics. Other transformations in philosophy were always based upon either the ideological negation of the reality of history, its sublimation in God (Plato, Descartes, Leibniz), or an <I>ideological</I> conception of history as the realization of philosophy itself (Kant, Hegel, Husserl): they were never able to attain the reality of history, which they always misunderstood or left aside. If the transformation imposed on philosophy by Marx is genuinely revolutionary from a philosophical point of view, this is because it took the reality of history seriously for the first time in history, and this simple difference comprehensively overturned the bases of existing philosophy.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;As for the proper function of philosophy, and its absolute necessity for Marxism, this too is based on profound theoretical reasons. Lenin expounded them very clearly in <I>Materialism and Empirio-criticism.</I> He showed that philosophy always played a fundamental theoretical role in the constitution and development of knowledge, and that Marxist philosophy simply resumed this role on its own account, but with means that were, in principle, infinitely purer and more fertile. We know that knowledge - in its strong sense, scientific knowledge - is not born and does not develop in isolation, protected by who-knows-what miracle from the influences of the surrounding world. Among these are social and political influences which may intervene directly in the life of the sciences, and very seriously compromise the course of their development, if not their very existence. We are aware of numerous historical examples. But there are less visible influences that are just as pernicious, if not still more dangerous, because they generally pass unnoticed: these are <I>ideological</I> influences. It was in breaking with the existing ideologies of history - at the end of a very arduous critical labour - that Marx was able to found the theory of history; and we know, too - from Engels's struggle against D&uuml;hring and Lenin's against the disciples of Mach - 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 12</B></FONT><P>

that, once founded by Marx, the theory of history did not escape the onslaught of ideologies, did not escape their influence and assaults. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In fact, every science - natural as well as social - is constantly submitted to the onslaught of existing ideologies, and particularly to that most disarming - because apparently non-ideological - ideology wherein the scientist 'spontaneously' reflects his/her own practice: 'empiricist' or 'positivist' ideology. As Engels once said, every scientist, whether he wants to or not, inevitably adopts a philosophy of science, and therefore cannot do without philosophy. The problem, then, is to know <I>which philosophy</I> he must have at his side: an ideology which deforms his scientific practice, or a scientific philosophy that accounts for it? An ideology that enthrals him to his errors and illusions, or, on the contrary, a philosophy that frees him from them and permits him really to master his own practice? The answer is not in doubt. This is what justifies the essential role of Marxist philosophy in regard to all knowledge: if based upon a false representation of the conditions of scientific practice, and of the relation of scientific practice to other practices, any science risks slowing its advance, if not getting caught in an impasse, or finally taking its own specific crises of development for crises of science as such - and thereby furnishing arguments for every conceivable kind of ideological and religious exploitation. (We have some recent examples with the 'crisis of modern physics' analysed by Lenin.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp12">6</A>]</FONT>) Furthermore, when a science is in the process of being born, there is a risk that it will put the ideology in which it is steeped into the service of its bad habits. We have some striking examples with the so-called human sciences, which are all too often merely techniques, blocked in their development by the empiricist ideology that dominates them, prevents them from perceiving their real foundation, defining their object, or even finding their basic principles in existing disciplines which are rejected because of ideological prohibitions or prejudices (like historical materialism, which should serve as the foundation of most of the human sciences). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What goes for the sciences holds in the first place <I>for historical materialism itself</I>, <I>which is a science among others and holds no privilege of immunity in this matter.</I> It too is constantly threatened by the dominant ideology, and we know the result: the different forms of revisionism which - in principle, and whatever form they take (economic, political, social, theoretical) - are always related to deviations of a

philosophical character: that is, to the direct or indirect influence of distorting philosophies, of ideological philosophies. In <I>Materialism and Empirio-criticism</I>, Lenin clearly demonstrated this, affirming that the <I>raison d'&ecirc:tre</I> of dialectical materialism was precisely to furnish principles that enable us to distinguish ideology from science, thus to unearth the traps of ideology, in interpretations of historical materialism as well. In this way, he demonstrated that what he calls 'partisanship in philosophy' - that is, the refusal of all ideology, and the precise consciousness of the <I>theory of scientificity</I> - was an absolutely imperative requirement for the very existence and development not only of the natural sciences but of the social sciences, and above all of historical materialism. It has aptly been said that Marxism is a 'guide to action'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp13">7</A>]</FONT> It can act as this 'guide' because it is not a false but a <I>true</I> guide, because it is a science - and for this reason alone. Let us say, with all the precautions required by this comparison, that in many circumstances the sciences also require a 'guide', not a false but a <I>true</I> guide; and among them, historical materialism itself has a vital need for this 'guide'. This 'guide' is dialectical materialism. And since there is no other 'guide' over and above dialectical materialism, we can understand why Lenin attributed an absolutely decisive importance to the adoption of a scientific position on philosophy; we can understand why dialectical materialism demands the highest consciousness and the strictest scientific rigour, the most careful theoretical vigilance: because it is the last possible recourse in the theoretical domain - at least for men and women who, like us, are liberated from religious myths of divine omniscience, or their profane version: dogmatism.

If, as we think, Marx's doctrine is a scientific doctrine, if all the goals and all the means of action of Communists are based on the application of the results of Marx's scientific theories, our first duty clearly concerns the <I>science</I> that furnishes us with the means to understand the reality of the historical world and to transform it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We thus have a categorical duty to treat Marx's theory (in its two domains: historical materialism, dialectical materialism) as what it is - a true science. In other words, we must be fully aware of what is implied

by the nature of a science, its constitution, its life, i.e. its development. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Today, this duty involves some specific demands. We are no longer in Marx's position, quite simply because we no longer have to do the prodigious work that he accomplished. Marxist theory exists for us first of all as a result, contained in a certain number of theoretical works and present in its political and social applications. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <I>In an existing science</I>, <I>the theoretical work that produced it is no longer visible to the naked eye </I>; <I>it has completely passed into the science as constituted.</I> There is a hidden danger here, because we may be tempted to treat constituted Marxist science as a given or as a set of finished truths - in short, to fashion an <I>empiricist</I> or <I>dogmatic</I> conception of science. We may consider it as an absolute, finished knowledge, which poses no problem of development or research; and then we shall be treating it in a <I>dogmatic</I> fashion. We may also - in so far as it gives us a knowledge of the real - believe that Marxist science <I>directly and naturally reflects the real</I>, that it sufficed for Marx to <I>see</I> clearly, to <I>read</I> clearly - in short, to <I>reflect</I> in his abstract theory the essence of things given in things - without taking into account the enormous work of theoretical production necessary to arrive at knowledge; and we shall then be treating it in an <I>empiricist</I> fashion. In the two interpretations - dogmatic and empiricist - we will have a false idea of science, because we will consider the knowledge of reality to be the knowledge of a pure given, whereas knowledge is, on the contrary, <I>a complex process of production of knowledges. The idea we have of science is decisive for Marxist science itself.</I> If we have a dogmatic conception we will do nothing to develop it, we will indefinitely repeat its results, and not only will the science not progress, it will wither. If we have an empiricist conception we risk being equally incapable of making the science progress, since we will be blind to the nature of the real process of the production of knowledges, and will remain in the wake of facts and events - in the wake, that is to say, lagging behind. If, on the contrary, we have a correct idea of science, of its nature, of the conditions of the <I>production of knowledges</I>, then we can develop it, give it the life that is its right, and in the absence of which it would no longer be a science but a dead, fixed dogma.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;To know what a science is, is above all to know <I>how</I> it is constituted, how it is <I>produced </I>: by an immense, specific theoretical labour, by an irreplaceable, extremely long, arduous and difficult theoretical practice.

This practice presupposes a whole series of specific theoretical conditions, into whose details it is not possible to enter here. The important point is that a science, far from reflecting the immediate givens of everyday experience and practice, is constituted only on the condition of calling them into question, and breaking with them, to the extent that its results, once achieved, appear indeed as the <I>contrary</I> of the obvious facts of practical everyday experience, rather than as their reflection.

  This theoretical work is not an abstraction in the sense of empiricist ideology. To know is not to extract from the impurities and diversity of the real the pure essence contained in the real, as gold is extracted from the dross of sand and dirt in which it is contained. To know is to <I>produce</I> the adequate concept of the object by putting to work means of theoretical production (theory and method), applied to a given raw material.

in general', or of political and economic practice. To speak only of practice in general, to speak solely of economic and political practice, without speaking of <I>theoretical practice as such</I>, is to foster the idea that non-scientific practices - <I>spontaneously, by themselves</I> - produce the equivalent of scientific practice, and to neglect the irreplaceable character and function of scientific practice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Marx and Lenin put us on guard on this point, in showing us that the economic and political practice of the proletariat was, by itself, incapable of producing the <I>science</I> of society, and hence the science of the proletariat's own practice, but was capable only of producing utopian or reformist ideologies of society. Marxist-Leninist science, which serves the objective interests of the working class, could not be the spontaneous product of proletarian practice; it was produced by the theoretical practice of intellectuals possessing a very high degree of culture (Marx, Engels, Lenin) and 'introduced from without'<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp16">11</A>]</FONT> into proletarian practice, which it then modified and profoundly transformed. It is a leftist theoretical error to say that Marxism is a 'proletarian science', if by this one means that it was or is produced <I>spontaneously by the proletariat.</I> This error is possible only if one passes over in silence the existence and irreplaceable functions of <I>scientific practice</I>, as the practice productive of science. A fundamental condition of this scientific practice is that it works on the 'givens' of the experience of the economic and political practice <I>of the proletariat and other classes.</I> But this is only <I>one</I> of its conditions, for all <I>scientific work</I> consists precisely in producing, by starting from the experience and results of these concrete practices, <I>knowledge of them</I>, which is the result of another practice, an entire, specific theoretical labour. And we can get an idea of the immense importance and considerable difficulties of such work by reading <I>Capital</I>, knowing that Marx worked for thirty years to lay its foundations and develop its conceptual analyses. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It must be remembered, then, that <I>no science is possible without the existence of a specific practice</I>, <I>distinct from other practices: scientific or theoretical practice.</I> It must be remembered that this practice is irreplaceable, and that - like any practice - it possesses its own laws, and requires its own means and conditions of activity.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;To know what a science is, is simultaneously to know that it can live only on condition that it <I>develops.</I> A science that repeats itself, without discovering anything new, is a dead science - no longer a science, but a fixed dogma. A science lives only in its development -

that is, from its discoveries. This point is likewise very significant because we may be tempted to believe that we possess completed sciences in historical and dialectical materialism as they are given to us today, and to be suspicious on principle of any new discovery. Naturally, the working-class movement has cause to be on guard against revisionisms that are always decked out in the robes of 'novelty' and 'renovation', but this necessary defence has nothing to do with suspicion of the discoveries of a living science. Were we to fall into this error, it would govern our attitude towards the sciences in question, and we would save ourselves the bother of what we nevertheless <I>must</I> do: devote all our efforts to developing these sciences, forcing them to produce new knowledges, new discoveries. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Marx, Engels and Lenin expressed themselves on this issue without any ambiguity. When, in a celebrated outburst, Marx said he was '<I>not a Marxist </I>',<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp17">12</A>]</FONT> he meant that he considered what he had done as simply the commencement of science, and not as a completed knowledge - because a completed knowledge is a non-sense that sooner or later leads to a non-science. Engels said the same when he wrote, for example, in 1877:

  Our position must consist in drawing theoretical and practical conclusions from these principles. In particular, if both historical and dialectical materialism are scientific disciplines, we <I>must</I> of necessity <I>develop them</I>, make them produce new knowledges - expect from them, as from any living science, some <I>discoveries.</I> It is generally admitted that it must be thus for historical materialism, but <I>it is not always clearly enough stated in the case of dialectical materialism</I>, because we do not have a precise idea of the character of a scientific discipline, because we remain fixed on the (idealist) idea that philosophy is not really a discipline of a scientific character. In fact, we would be hard pressed to indicate the discoveries produced since Lenin in the domain of dialectical materialism, which has remained in practically the same state that Lenin brought it to in <I>Materialism and Empirio-criticism.</I> If this is so, it

</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 19</B></FONT><P>

is a state of affairs which must be examined very seriously, and then rectified. At the same time, if historical materialism has accrued the great theoretical discoveries of Lenin (the theory of imperialism, of the Communist Party, the beginning of a theory of the specific nature of the first phase of the forms of transition from the capitalist to the socialist mode of production), it has not subsequently been the site of important <I>theoretical</I> developments, which are, however, indispensable for solving the problems we face today - to name but one, the problem of the forms of transition between the complex modes of production combined in the so-called 'underdeveloped' countries and the socialist mode of production. In the same way, the difficulty of accounting <I>theoretically</I> for a historical fact as significant as the 'cult of personality' makes the insufficient development of the theory of the specific forms of transition between the capitalist and socialist modes of production, perfectly apparent.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  3.&nbsp;If to develop Marxist science (in its two domains) is a <I>duty</I> for Communists, this duty must be considered in its concrete conditions. For a science to be able to develop, it is first of all necessary to have a correct idea of the nature of science and, in particular, of the means by which it develops, and therefore of all the real conditions of its development. It is necessary to assure these conditions and, in particular, to recognize - theoretically and practically - the irreplaceable role of <I>scientific practice</I> in the development of science. It is necessary, then, clearly to define our theory of science, to reject all dogmatic and empiricist interpretations, and to make a precise conception of science prevail intellectually and practically. It is also necessary <I>practically</I> to assure the conditions of scientific freedom required by theoretical research, to provide the material means of this freedom (organizations, theoretical reviews, etc.). Finally, the real conditions of scientific or theoretical research in the domain of Marxism itself must be created. It is to this concern that the creation of the Centre d'&Eacute;tudes et de Recherches Marxistes and the Institut Maurice Thorez must respond in France. But it is also necessary for these different measures to be co-ordinated, considered as parts of a whole, and for a comprehensive politics - which can only be the act of the Party - to be conceived and applied in the matter of theory and theoretical research, in order to give historical and dialectical materialism the chance to develop, to live a real scientific life, and thereby to produce new knowledges. It must also be recognized that theoretical research cannot consist in simply repeating or commenting upon already acquired truths, and, <I>a fortiori</I>, that it has nothing to do with developing simple ideological themes or mere personal opinions. Theoretical research begins only in the zone that separates those know- 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 20</B></FONT><P>

ledges already acquired and deeply assimilated from knowledges not yet acquired. To do scientific research this zone must have been reached and crossed. Accordingly, it is necessary to recognize that theoretical research demands a very strong theoretical formation simply to be possible, that it therefore supposes possession of a high degree not only of Marxist culture (which is absolutely indispensable) but also of scientific and philosophical culture in general. It is therefore necessary to encourage by all means this general education, at the same time as encouraging <I>Marxist theoretical formation</I>, the indispensable preliminary basis for all Marxist theoretical and scientific research.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  4.&nbsp;We risk no error in proposing that the development of Marxist theory, in all its domains, is a primary, urgent necessity for our times, and an absolutely essential task for all Communists and for two different kinds of reason. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   <I>The first kind of reason</I> has to do with the very nature of the new tasks that 'life' - that is, history - imposes upon us. Since the 1917 Revolution and the era of Lenin, immense events have turned world history upside down. The growth of the Soviet Union, the victory against Nazism and Fascism, the great Chinese Revolution, the Cuban Revolution and Cuba's passage into the socialist camp, the liberation of the former colonies, the revolt of the Third World against imperialism, have overturned the balance of forces in the world. But at the same time these events pose a considerable number of new, sometimes unprecedented problems, for whose solution the development of Marxist theory - and especially the Marxist theory of the <I>forms of transition</I> from one mode of production to another - is indispensable. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This theory not only concerns the <I>economic</I> problems of transition (forms of planning, the adaptation of the forms of planning to different specific stages of the transition, according to the particular condition of the countries considered); it also concerns the <I>political</I> problems (forms of the State, forms of the political organization of the revolutionary party, the forms and nature of the revolutionary party's intervention in the different domains of political, economic and ideological activity) and the <I>ideological</I> problems of transition (politics in the religious, moral, juridical, aesthetic and philosophical, etc., domains). The theory to be developed not only concerns the problems posed by so-called 'underdeveloped' countries in their transition to socialism, it also concerns the problems of countries already engaged in the socialist mode of production (the USSR) or close to it (China) - all the problems of planning, the definition of new legal and political forms in close correspondence with new relations of production (pre-socialist, socialist, Communist) and, of course, all the problems posed by the existence of a socialist camp in

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 21</B></FONT><P>

which complex economic, political and ideological relations exist as a function of the <I>uneven</I> development of the different countries. Finally, the theory to be developed concerns the current nature of imperialism, the transformations of the capitalist mode of production in the new conjuncture, the development of the productive forces, the new forms of economic concentration and government of the monopolies, and all the strategic and tactical problems of Communists in the current phase of the class struggle. All these problems open onto the future of socialism, and must be posed and resolved as a function of our definition of socialism and its appropriate structures. With all these problems, we are on the very terrain knowledge of which Lenin enjoined Communists to produce for each country, by developing Marxist theory on the basis of the knowledges already produced, as marked out by the 'foundation stone' of Marx's discoveries. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But it is not only the new face of history and its problems which obliges us resolutely to develop Marxist theory. We are confronted with a <I>second kind of reason</I> that has to do with the theoretical time lag that built up during the period of the 'cult of personality'. Lenin's slogan 'to develop theory in order to keep pace with life' is especially cogent here. If we would be hard pressed to cite any discoveries of great calibre in many areas of Marxist theory since Lenin, this is due in large part to the conditions in which the international working-class movement was enmeshed by the politics of the 'cult', by its countless victims in the ranks of very valuable militants, intellectuals and scientists, by the ravages inflicted by dogmatism on the intellect. If the politics of the 'cult' did not compromise the development of the material bases of socialism, it did, for many years, literally sacrifice and block all development of Marxist-Leninist theory; it effectively ignored all the indispensable conditions for theoretical reflection and research and, with the suspicion it cast on any theoretical novelty, dealt a very serious blow in practice to the freedom of scientific research and to all discovery. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The effects of dogmatic politics as far as theory is concerned can still be felt today, not only in the residues of dogmatism but also, paradoxically, in the often anarchic and confused forms assumed by the attempts of numerous Marxist intellectuals to regain possession of the freedom of reflection and research of which they were deprived for so long. Today this phenomenon is relatively widespread, not only in Marxist circles but in the Marxist parties themselves, and even in the socialist countries. What is most painful - and directly expressed in these generous, if often ideologically confused, essays - is how the period of the 'cult', far from contributing to their formation, on the contrary, prevented the theoretical formation of an entire generation of Marxist researchers, whose work we cruelly miss today. Time is required - a

great deal of it - to form real theoreticians, and all the time lost in forming them costs in terms of a dearth of works, a delay, a stagnation, if not a regression, in the production of science, of knowledge. This is all the more true, since the positions that Marxists did not know how to occupy in the domain of knowledge have not remained vacant: they are occupied - especially in the domain of the 'human sciences' - by bourgeois 'scientists' or 'theoreticians', under the direct domination of bourgeois ideology, with all the practical, political, and theoretical consequences whose disastrous effects can be observed - or rather, whose disastrous effects <I>are not always even suspected.</I> Not only, then, do we have to make good our own delay, but we have to reoccupy on our own behalf the areas that fall to us by right (to the extent that they depend on historical materialism and dialectical materialism) and we have to reoccupy them in difficult conditions, involving a clear-minded struggle against the prestige of the results apparently achieved by their actual occupants. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For these two kinds of reason - historical and theoretical - it is clear that the task of developing Marxist theory in all its domains is a political and theoretical task of the first order.

5.&nbsp;Ideology
</B>

<P>
To be able, as rigorously as possible, to draw out the <I>practical</I> consequences of what has just been said about Marxist scientific theory, it is now necessary to situate and define an important new term: <I>ideology.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We have already seen that what distinguishes Marxist working-class organizations is the fact that they base their socialist objectives, their means of action and forms of organization, their revolutionary strategy and tactics, on the principles of a <I>scientific</I> theory - that of Marx - and not on this or that anarchist, utopian, reformist, or other ideological theory. Therewith, we have underscored <I>a crucial distinction and opposition between science on the one hand</I>, <I>and ideology on the other.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But we have also foregrounded an actual reality, as real for the break that Marx had to effect with ideological theories of history in order to found his scientific discoveries as for the struggle waged by any science against the ideology that assaults it: not only does ideology precede every science, but ideology survives after the constitution of science, and despite its existence. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Furthermore, we have had to remark that ideology manifests its existence and its effects not only in the domain of its relations with science, but in an infinitely wider domain - that of society in its entirety. When we spoke of the 'ideology of the working class', to say that the <I>ideology</I>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 23</B></FONT><P>

of the working class - which was 'spontaneously' anarchist and utopian at the outset, and then became generally reformist - was gradually transformed by the influence and action of Marxist theory into a <I>new ideology </I>; when we say that today the ideology of large sectors of the working class has become an ideology of a Marxist-Leninist character; when we say that we have to wage not only an economic struggle (through the unions) and a political struggle (through the Party) but an <I>ideological struggle</I> among the masses - when we say all this, it is clear that under the term <I>ideology</I> we are advancing a notion that involves <I>social realities</I>, which, while having something to do with a certain representation (and thus a certain 'knowledge') of the real, go far beyond the simple question of knowledge, to bring into play a properly <I>social</I> reality and function. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We are aware, then, in the practical use we make of this notion, that <I>ideology</I> implies a double relation: with knowledge on the one hand, and with society on the other. The nature of this double relation is not simple, and requires some effort to define. This effort of definition is indispensable if it is true, as we have seen, that it is of primary importance for Marxism to define itself unequivocally as a <I>science</I> - that is, as a reality distinct from <I>ideology</I> - and if it is true that the action of revolutionary organizations based upon the scientific theory of Marxism must develop in society, where at every moment and stage of their struggle, even in the consciousness of the working class, they confront the social existence of <I>ideology.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In order to grasp this important but difficult problem, it is vital to step back a little and return to the principles of the Marxist theory of <I>ideology</I>, which form part of the Marxist theory of society. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Marx showed that every social formation constitutes an 'organic totality', comprised of three essential 'levels': the economy, politics, and <I>ideology</I> - or '<I>forms of social consciousness' </I>.<FONT SIZE=-2>[16]</FONT> The ideological 'level', then, represents an objective reality, indispensable to the existence of a social formation - an objective reality: that is, a reality independent of the subjectivity of the individuals who are subject to it, even whilst it concerns these individuals themselves; this is why Marx used the expression 'forms of social-consciousness'. How does the objective reality and social function of <I>ideology</I> present itself? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In a given society, people participate in <I>economic</I> production whose mechanisms and effects are determined by the <I>structure of the relations of production </I>; people participate in <I>political</I> activity whose mechanisms

</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 24</B></FONT><P>

and effects are governed by the <I>structure of class relations</I> (the <I>class struggle</I>, law and the State). These same people participate in other activities - religious, moral, philosophical, etc. - either in an active manner, through conscious practice, or in a passive and mechanical manner, through reflexes, judgements, attitudes, etc. These last activities constitute <I>ideological activity</I>, they are sustained by voluntary or involuntary, conscious or unconscious, adherence to an ensemble of representations and beliefs - religious, moral, legal, political, aesthetic, philosophical, etc. - which constitute what is called the 'level' of <I>ideology.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Ideological <I>representations</I> concern nature and society, the very world in which men live; they concern the life of men, their relations to nature, to society, to the social order, to other men and to their own activities, including economic and political practice. Yet these representations are not <I>true knowledges</I> of the world they represent. They may contain some <I>elements</I> of knowledge, but they are always integrated into, and subject to, a total system of such representations, a system that is, in principle, orientated and distorted, a system dominated by a <I>false conception</I> of the world or of the domain of objects under consideration. In fact, in their real practice, be it economic or political, people are effectively determined by <I>objective structures</I> (relations of production, political class relations); their practice convinces them of the <I>existence</I> of this reality, makes them perceive <I>certain objective effects</I> of the action of these structures, but conceals the essence of these structures from them. They cannot, through their mere practice, attain <I>true knowledge</I> of these structures, of either the economic or political reality in whose mechanism they nevertheless play a definite role. This knowledge of the <I>mechanism of economic and political structures</I> can derive only from <I>another practice</I>, distinct from immediate economic or political practice, <I>scientific practice</I> - in the same way that knowledge of the laws of nature cannot be the product of simple technical practice and perception, which provide only empirical observations and technical formulae, but is, on the contrary, the product of specific practices - <I>scientifc practices</I> - distinct from immediate practices. None the less, men and women, who do not have knowledge of the political, economic and social realities in which they have to live, act and perform the tasks assigned them by the division of labour, cannot live without being guided by some <I>representation</I> of their world and their relations to this world. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In the first instance men and women find this representation ready-made at birth, existing in society itself, just as they find - pre-existing them - the relations of production and political relations in which they will have to live. Just as they are born 'economic animals' and 'political animals', it might be said that men and women are born 'ideological

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 25</B></FONT><P>

animals'. It is as if people, in order to exist as conscious, active social beings in the society that conditions all their existence, needed to possess a certain <I>representation</I> of their world, a representation which may remain largely unconscious or, on the contrary, be more or less conscious and thought out. Thus, ideology appears as a certain '<I>representation of the world </I>' which relates men and women to their conditions of existence, and to each other, in the division of their tasks and the equality or inequality of their lot. From primitive societies - where classes did not exist - onwards, the existence of this <I>bond</I> can be observed, and it is not by chance that the first form of this ideology, the reality of this bond, is to be found in <I>religion</I> ('bond' is one of the possible etymologies of the word <I>religion </I>). In a class society, ideology serves not only to help people live their own conditions of existence, to perform their assigned tasks, but also to 'bear' their condition - either the poverty of the exploitation of which they are the victims, or the exorbitant privilege of the power and wealth of which they are the beneficiaries. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The representations of ideology thus consciously or unconsciously accompany all the acts of individuals, all their activity, and all their relations - like so many landmarks and reference points, laden with prohibitions, permissions, obligations, submissions and hopes. If one represents society according to Marx's classic metaphor - as an edifice, a building, where a juridico-political <I>superstructure</I> rests upon the infrastructure of economic foundations - ideology must be accorded a very particular place. In order to understand its kind of effectivity, it must be situated in the <I>superstructure</I> and assigned a relative autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis law and the State; but at the same time, to understand its most general form of presence, ideology must be thought of as sliding into all the parts of the edifice, and considered as a distinctive kind of <I>cement</I> that assures the adjustment and cohesion of men in their roles, their functions and their social relations. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In fact, ideology permeates all man's activities, including his economic and political practice; it is present in attitudes towards work, towards the agents of production, towards the constraints of production, in the idea that the worker has of the mechanism of production; it is present in political judgements and attitudes - cynicism, clear conscience, resignation or revolt, etc.; it governs the conduct of individuals in families and their behaviour towards others, their attitude towards nature, their judgement on the 'meaning of life' in general, their different cults (God, the prince, the State, etc.). Ideology is so much present in all the acts and deeds of individuals that it is <I>indistinguishable from their 'lived experience'</I>, and every unmediated analysis of the 'lived' is profoundly marked by the themes of ideological obviousness. When he 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 26</B></FONT><P>

thinks he is dealing with pure, naked perception of reality itself, or a pure practice, the individual (and the empiricist philosopher) is, in truth, dealing with an impure perception and practice, marked by the invisible structures of ideology; since he does not perceive ideology, he takes his perception of things and of the world as the perception of 'things themselves', without realizing that this perception is given him only in the veil of unsuspected forms of ideology. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This is the first essential characteristic of ideology: like all social realities, it is intelligible only through its <I>structure.</I> Ideology comprises representations, images, signs, etc., but these elements considered in isolation from each other, do not compose ideology. It is their <I>systematicity</I>, their <I>mode of arrangement and combination</I>, that gives them their meaning; it is their <I>structure</I> that determines their meaning and function. The <I>structure</I> and mechanisms of ideology are no more immediately <I>visible</I> to the people subjected to them than the <I>structure</I> of the relations of production, and the mechanisms of economic life produced by it, are visible to the agents of production. They do not perceive the ideology of their representation of the world <I>as ideology </I>; they do not <I>know</I> either its structure or its mechanisms. They <I>practise</I> their ideology (as one says a believer practises his religion), they do not know it. It is because it is determined by its <I>structure</I> that the reality of ideology exceeds all the forms in which it is subjectively lived by this or that individual; it is for this reason that it is irreducible to the individual forms in which it is lived; it is for this reason that <I>it can be the object of an objective study.</I> It is for this reason that we can speak of the nature and function of ideology, and study it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Now a study of ideology reveals some remarkable characteristics.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;We notice, first of all, that the term <I>ideology</I> covers a reality which - while diffused throughout the body of society - is divisible into distinct areas, into <I>specific regions</I>, centred on several different themes. Thus, in our societies, the domain of ideology in general can be divided into relatively autonomous regions: religious ideology, moral ideology, juridical ideology, political ideology, aesthetic ideology, philosophical ideology. Historically, these regions have not always existed in these distinct forms; they only appeared gradually. It is to be expected that certain regions will disappear, or be combined with others, in the course of the development of socialism and Communism, and that those which remain will participate in the internal redivisions of the general domain of ideology. It is also important to remark that, depending upon the historical period (that is, the mode of production), and within identical modes of production, according to the different social formations in existence, and also, as we shall see, the different social classes, this or

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 27</B></FONT><P>

that <I>region of ideology</I> dominates the others in the general domain of ideology. This explains, for example, the remarks of Marx and Engels on the dominant influence of religious ideology in all the movements of peasant revolt from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries, and even in certain early forms of the working-class movement; or, indeed, Marx's remark (which was not in jest) that the French have a head for politics, the English for economics, and the Germans for philosophy<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp27">17</A>]</FONT> - a significant remark for understanding certain problems specific to the working-class traditions in these different countries. The same kind of observations might be made regarding the importance of religion in certain liberation movements in former colonial countries, or in the resistance of Blacks to white racism in the United States. Knowledge of the different regions within ideology, knowledge of the <I>dominant ideological region</I> (whether religious, political, juridical, or moral), is of prime importance for the strategy and tactics of ideological struggle.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   2.&nbsp;We note as well another essential characteristic of ideology. In each of these regions, ideology, which always has a determinate structure, can exist <I>in more or less diffuse or unthought forms</I>,  <I>or</I>, <I>contrariwise</I>, <I>in more or less conscious</I>, <I>reflected</I>, <I>and explicitly systematized forms - theoretical forms.</I> We know that a religious ideology can exist with rules, rites, etc., but without a systematic theology; the advent of theology represents a degree of theoretical systematization of religious ideology. The same goes for moral, political, aesthetic ideology, etc.; they can exist in an untheorized, unsystematized form, as customs, trends, tastes, etc., or, on the contrary, in a systematized and reflected form: ideological moral theory, ideological political theory, etc. The highest form of the theorization of ideology is <I>philosophy</I>, which is very important, since it constitutes the laboratory of <I>theoretical abstraction</I>, born of ideology, but itself treated as theory. It is as a theoretical laboratory that philosophical ideology has played, and still plays, a very significant role in the birth of the sciences, and in their development. We have seen that Marx did not abolish philosophy; by a revolution in the domain of philosophy he transformed its nature, rid it of the ideological heritage hindering it and made of it a scientific discipline - thus giving it incomparable means with which to play its role as the theory of real scientific practice. At the same time, we must be aware that - with the

<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
17.&nbsp;Althusser's gloss on Marx's discussion of the German status quo in 'A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Introduction', <I>Early Writings</I>, pp. 243-57. [Ed.]
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 28</B></FONT><P>

exception of philosophy <I>in the strict sense</I> - ideology, in each of its domains, is irreducible to its <I>theoretical</I> expression, which is generally accessible only to a small number of people; it exists in the masses in a theoretically unreflected form, which prevails over its theorized form.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  3.&nbsp;Once we have situated ideology as a whole, once we have marked out its different regions, identified the region that dominates the others, and come to know the different forms (theorized and untheorized) in which it exists, a decisive step remains to be taken in order to understand the ultimate meaning of ideology: <I>the meaning of its social function.</I> This can be brought out only if we understand ideology, with Marx, as an element of the <I>superstructure</I> of society, and the essence of this element of the superstructure in its relation with the <I>structure of the whole</I> of society. Thus, it can be seen that the function of ideology in class societies is intelligible only on the basis of the existence of social classes. In a classless society, as in a class society, ideology has the function of assuring the <I>bond</I> among people in the totality of the forms of their existence, the <I>relation</I> of individuals to their tasks assigned by the social structure. In a class society, this function is <I>dominated</I> by the form taken by the division of labour in distributing people into <I>antagonistic classes.</I> It can then be seen that ideology is destined to assure the cohesion of the relations of men and women to each other, and of people to their tasks, in the general structure of class exploitation, which thus prevails over all other relations. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Ideology is thus destined, <I>above all</I>, an to assure the domination of one class over others, and the economic exploitation that maintains its pre-eminence, by making the exploited accept their condition as based on the will of God, 'nature', moral 'duty', etc. But ideology is not only a 'beautiful lie' invented by the exploiters to dupe the exploited and keep them marginalized; it also helps <I>individuals of the dominant class</I> to recognize themselves as dominant class subjects, to accept the domination they exercise over the exploited as 'willed by God', as fixed by 'nature', or as assigned by a moral 'duty'. Thus, it likewise serves them as a bond of social cohesion which helps them <I>act as members of the same class</I>, the class of exploiters. The 'beautiful lie' of ideology thus has a double usage: it works on the consciousness of the exploited to make them accept their condition as 'natural'; it also works on the consciousness of members of the dominant class to allow them to exercise their exploitation and domination as 'natural'.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  4.&nbsp;Here we touch on the decisive point which, in class societies, is at the origin of the <I>falsity</I> of ideological <I>representation.</I> In class societies, ideology is a representation of the real, but necessarily distorted,

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 29</B></FONT><P>

because necessarily biased and tendentious - tendentious because its aim is not to provide men with <I>objective knowledge</I> of the social system in which they live but, on the contrary, to give them a mystified representation of this social system in order to keep them in their 'place' in the system of class exploitation. Of course, it would also be necessary to pose the problem of the function of ideology in a classless society - and it would be resolved by showing that the deformation of ideology is socially necessary as a function of the nature of the social whole itself, as a function (to be more precise) of <I>its determination by its structure</I>, which renders it - as a social whole - opaque to the individuals who occupy a place in society determined by this structure. The opacity of the social structure necessarily renders <I>mythic</I> that representation of the world which is indispensable for social cohesion. In class societies this first function of ideology remains, but is dominated by the new social function imposed by the <I>existence of class division</I>, which takes ideology far from the former function. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If we want to be exhaustive, if we want to take account of these two principles of necessary deformation, we must say that in a class society, ideology is necessarily deforming and mystifying, both because it is produced as deforming by the opacity of the determination of society by its structure and because it is produced as deforming by the existence of class division. It is necessary to come to this point to understand why ideology, as representation of the world and of society, is, by strict necessity, a <I>deforming and mystifying</I> representation of the reality in which men and women have to live, a representation destined to make men and women accept the place and role that the structure of this society imposes upon them, in their <I>immediate</I> consciousness and behaviour. We understand, by this, that ideological representation imparts a certain '<I>representation </I>' of reality, that it makes <I>allusion</I> to the real in a certain way, but that at the same time it bestows only an <I>illusion</I> on reality. We also understand that ideology gives men a certain 'knowledge' of their world, or rather allows them to 'recognize' themselves in their world, gives them a certain 'recognition'; but at the same time ideology only introduces them to its <I>misrecognition. Allusion-illusion</I> or <I>recognition-misrecognition</I> - such is ideology from the perspective of its relation to the real. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It will now be understood why every science, when it is born, has to break from the mystified-mystifying representation of ideology; and why ideology, in its <I>allusive-illusory</I> function, can survive science, since its object is not knowledge but a social and objective misrecognition of the real. It will also be understood that in its social function science cannot replace ideology, contrary to what the <I>philosophes</I> of the Enlightenment believed, seeing only illusion (or error) in ideology without seeing its 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 30</B></FONT><P>

<I>allusion</I> to the real, without seeing in it the social function of the initially disconcerting - but essential - couple: <I>illusion</I> and <I>allusion</I>, recognition and misrecognition.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  5.&nbsp;An important remark concerning class societies must be added. If in its totality ideology expresses a representation of the real destined to sanction a regime of class exploitation and domination, it can also give rise, in certain circumstances, to the expression of the <I>protest of the exploited classes</I> against their own exploitation. This is why we must now specify that ideology is not only divided into regions, but also <I>divided into tendencies</I> within its own social existence. Marx showed that 'the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp30">18</A>]</FONT> This simple phrase puts us on the path to understanding that just as there are dominant and dominated classes in society, so too there are dominant and dominated ideologies. Within ideology in general, we thus observe the existence of <I>different ideological tendencies</I> that express the 'representations' of the different social classes. This is the sense in which we speak of bourgeois ideology, petty-bourgeois ideology, or proletarian ideology. But we should not lose sight of the fact that in the case of the capitalist mode of production these petty-bourgeois and proletarian ideologies remain <I>subordinate</I> ideologies, and that in them - even in the protests of the exploited - it is always the ideas of the dominant class (or bourgeois ideology) which get the upper hand. This scientific truth is of prime importance for understanding the history of the working-class movement and the practice of Communists. What do we mean when we say, with Marx, that bourgeois ideology dominates other ideologies, and in particular working-class ideology? We mean that working-class protest against exploitation expresses itself <I>within the very structure of the dominant bourgeois ideology</I>, within its <I>system</I>, and in large part with its representations and terms of reference. We mean, for example, that the ideology of working-class protest 'naturally' expresses itself in the form of bourgeois law and morality. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The whole history of utopian socialism and trade-union reformism attests to this. The pressure of bourgeois ideology is such, and bourgeois ideology is so exclusively the provider of raw ideological material (frames of thought, systems of reference), <I>that the working class cannot, by its own resources</I>, <I>radically liberate itself from bourgeois ideology </I>; at best, the working class can express its protest and its aspirations by using certain elements of bourgeois ideology, but it remains the prisoner of that ideology, held in its dominant structure.

class ideology to transform itself to the point of freeing itself from bourgeois ideology it must <I>receive</I>, <I>from without</I>, <I>the help of science </I>; it must transform itself under the influence of a new element, radically distinct from ideology: science. The fundamental Leninist thesis of the 'importation' of Marxist science into the working-class movement is thus not an arbitrary thesis or the description of an 'accident' of history; it is founded in necessity, in the nature of ideology itself, and in the absolute limits of the natural development of the 'spontaneous' ideology of the working class. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Very schematically summarized, these are the specific characteristics of ideology.

6.&nbsp;The Union of Marx's Scientific Theory and the<BR>
Working-class Movement
</B>

<P>
What has just been said regarding, on the one hand, the scientific theory of Marx and, on the other, the nature of ideology, allows us to understand in exactly what terms to pose the problem of the historical emergence, and the existence and action, of Marxist-Leninist organizations.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  1.&nbsp;<I>The first cardinal principle</I> was formulated by Marx, Engels, Kautsky and Lenin: the principle of the <I>importation</I> into the existing working-class movement of a scientific doctrine produced <I>outside the working class</I> by Karl Marx, an intellectual of bourgeois origin who rallied to the cause of the proletariat. The working-class movement of 1840s Europe was then subject to either proletarian (anarchist) or more or less petty-bourgeois and utopian (Fourier, Owen, Proudhon) <I>ideologies.</I> By itself, the working class could not break out of the circle of an <I>ideological</I> representation of its goals and means of action; and we know that by virtue of the relay of moralizing, utopian, and thus reformist petty-bourgeois ideology, this ideological representation was, and remained, subjugated by the dominant ideology - that of the bourgeoisie. Even today, social-democratic working-class organizations have remained in this reformist ideological tradition. To conceive the scientific doctrine of socialism, the resources of scientific and philosophical culture, as well as exceptional intellectual capacities, were required. An extraordinary sense of the need to break with ideological forms, to escape their grip, and to discover the terrain of scientific knowledge was necessary. This discovery, this foundation of a new science and philosophy, was the work of Marx's genius, but it was also an unrelenting work, in which - in the most abject poverty - he used all his energies and sacrificed everything to his enterprise. Engels carried on 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 32</B></FONT><P>

his work, and Lenin developed it anew. This, then, is the scientific doctrine which, in the course of a long and patient struggle, was <I>imported from without</I> into a working-class movement still given over to ideology, and transformed that movement's theoretical foundations.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;<I>The second cardinal principle</I> concerns the nature of the <I>historical union</I> sealed between Marx's scientific theory and the working-class movement. This historical union, whose effects dominate all of contemporary history, was by no means an accident, even a happy one. The working-class movement existed <I>before Marx</I> conceived his doctrine; its existence did not, therefore, depend on Marx. The working-class movement is an objective reality, produced by the very necessity of the resistance, the revolt, the economic and political struggle of the working-class - itself produced as an exploited class by the capitalist mode of production. Now, we notice an incontestable historical fact, which has not only survived the worst ordeals (the crushing of the Commune, imperialist wars, suppression of working-class organizations in Italy, Germany and Spain, etc.) but been prodigiously reinforced over the course of time: the most important part - by far - of the working-class movement <I>adopted Marx's scientific theory as its doctrine</I>, and successfully applied this theory in its strategy and tactics as well as in its means and forms of organization and struggle. This adoption was not painless. It took dozens and dozens of years, experiences, trials and struggles for this adoption to be sealed. And even today the struggle continues: the struggle between so-called 'spontaneous' ideological conceptions of the working class - anarchistic, Blanquist, voluntarist, and other ideologies - and the scientific doctrine of Marx and Lenin. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If, then, the working-class movement adopted Marx's scientific doctrine <I>against</I> its incessantly resurgent 'spontaneous' ideological tendencies, and if the working-class movement made this adoption <I>of its own accord</I>, without compulsion, this is because a profound necessity presided over this adoption - over the union of the working-class movement and the scientific doctrine of Marx. This necessity resides in the fact that Marx produced <I>objective knowledge</I> of capitalist society, that he understood and demonstrated the necessity of class struggle, the necessity and the revolutionary role of the working-class movement, and thus provided the working-class movement with the knowledge of the objective laws of its existence, of its goals, and its action. It is because the working-class movement <I>recognized</I> in Marxist doctrine the objective theory of its existence and its action; it is because the working-class movement recognized in Marxist theory the theory that enabled it to understand the reality of the capitalist mode of production and its own struggles; it is because the working-class movement recognized, by

experience, that this doctrine was true, that it imparted to its struggle an objective foundation and genuinely revolutionary objective means - it is for these reasons that the working-class movement adopted Marxist theory. <I>It is because the working-class movement knew itself in Marxist theory that it recognized itself in it.</I> It is the scientific truth of Marxist theory that has sealed its union with the working-class movement and made this union definitive. There is nothing fortuitous in this historical fact; everything here is a matter of <I>necessity</I>, <I>and of its comprehension.</I>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  3.&nbsp;<I>The third cardinal principle</I> concerns the process by which this union was finally produced and by which it must unceasingly be maintained, reinforced, and extended. If the 'importation' of Marxist theory required a long haul and a great effort, this is precisely because it was effected through a protracted labour of <I>education and formation in Marxist theory</I> and, at the same time, a long <I>ideological struggle.</I> Marx and Engels had patiently to convince the best - the most dedicated and the most conscious - working-class militants to abandon existing ideological foundations and adopt the scientific foundations of socialism. This protracted work of education took many forms: direct political action by Marx and Engels, theoretical formation of militants in the course of the struggle itself (during the revolutionary period 1848-49), scientific publications, conferences, propaganda, etc.; and naturally, very quickly - once the conditions existed - <I>organizational measures</I>, on the national and then the international plane. In these terms, we can see the history of the First International as the history of the long struggle waged by Marx, Engels and their partisans to make the fundamental principles of Marxist theory prevail in the working-class movement. But at the same time as they were performing this work of education and formation in scientific theory, Marx, Engels and their partisans were constrained to wage a long, patient but harsh struggle <I>against the ideologies</I> that then dominated the working-class movement and its organizations, and against the religious, political and moral ideology of the bourgeoisie. <I>Theoretical formation</I> on the one hand, <I>ideological struggle</I> on the other - these are the two absolutely essential forms, two absolutely essential conditions, which governed the profound transformation of the spontaneous ideology of the working-class movement. These are two tasks which have never ceased, and will never cease, to impose themselves as vital tasks, indispensable to the existence and development of the revolutionary movement in the world - tasks which today condition the passage to socialism, the construction of socialism, and will later condition the transition to Communism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Theoretical formation, ideological struggle - two notions which must now be examined in more detail.

7.&nbsp;Theoretical Formation and Ideological Struggle
</B>

<P>
The problem we now examine is distinct from the problem of the nature of Marxist science, distinct from the conditions of the exercise and development of its theoretical practice. We are now presupposing that Marxist science exists as a true living science, which continues to grow and to enrich itself with new discoveries, vis-&agrave;-vis the questions that the working-class movement and the development of the sciences pose to it. We are considering Marxist science as existing, as possessing at a given moment of its development a definite body of theoretical principles, analyses, scientific demonstrations, and conclusions - that is, knowledges. And we are asking ourselves the following question: <I>by what means</I> can and must one make this science pass into the working-class movement? <I>By what means</I> can this scientific doctrine be made to pass into the consciousness and the practice of working-class organizations? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To answer this question it is necessary to step back again, this time to examine what the <I>practice</I> of the working-class movement in general consists of, independently of the scientific character of the principles brought to it by Marx. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  As soon as the working-class movement gained a certain strength, and endowed itself with a minimum of organization, its <I>practice</I> was subject to objective laws, founded on the class relations of capitalist society as well as the total overall structure of society. The practice of the working-class movement, even in its utopian and reformist organizational forms, unfolds in three planes, corresponding to the three 'levels' constitutive of society: the <I>economic</I>, the <I>political</I>, and the <I>ideological.</I> Nor is this law specific to the working-class movement; it applies to any political movement, whatever its social nature and objectives. Of course, the class nature of different political movements or parties causes the forms of existence of this general law to vary considerably, but this law, with its variations, imposes itself on all political movements. The action of the working-class movement thus necessarily takes the form of a triple struggle: <I>economic</I> struggle, <I>political</I> struggle, <I>ideological</I> struggle. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We know that the <I>economic struggle</I> developed first, in sporadic fashion initially, then in more and more organized forms. In <I>Capital</I>, Marx shows us that the first phases of the proletariat's economic struggle unfolded around several themes, the most important of which were the struggles for the reduction of the working day, to defend and raise wages, etc. Other themes have intervened in the subsequent history of the working-class movement: the struggle for job security, for social benefits (social security), for paid holidays, etc. In all these cases, we are dealing with a struggle waged on the terrain of <I>economic exploitation</I>, and thus at the level of the <I>relations of production</I> themselves. This

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 35</B></FONT><P>

struggle corresponds to the immediate practice of the workers, to the sufferings imposed on them as victims of economic exploitation, to their direct experience of this exploitation, and to their direct understanding - in this experience - of the economic <I>fact</I> of exploitation. In large-scale modern industry, wage workers, concentrated by the technical forms of production, directly perceive the class relation of economic exploitation, and they see in the capitalist boss the person who exploits them and benefits from their exploitation. Direct experience of wage labour and economic exploitation cannot furnish <I>knowledge of the mechanisms</I> of the economy of the capitalist mode of production, but is sufficient to make the workers aware of their exploitation and organize and engage in their economic struggle. This struggle is developed in <I>trade unions</I>, created by the workers themselves, without the intervention of Marxist science; these unions can survive and fight without recourse to Marxist science, and that is why trade-union action constitutes the chosen ground for economic <I>reformism</I> - a conception that anticipates the revolutionary transformation of society <I>from economic struggle alone.</I> It is this 'trade-unionist', apolitical-syndicalist conception that feeds the <I>anarcho-syndicalist</I> tradition, with its suspicion of politics, in the working-class movement. This is why Marx could say that trade unionism - that is, the organization of economic struggle on reformist premisses, and the reduction of the struggle of the working-class movement to economic struggle - constitutes the furthest extent, the limit-point of the evolution of the working-class movement 'left to its own devices'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Whether it wants to or not, however, economic struggle always runs up against <I>political realities</I> that intervene directly and violently in the course of the economic struggle - if only in the form of the <I>repression</I> of protests, strikes and revolts during the workers' economic struggle by the forces of the bourgeois State and law: the police, the army, the courts, etc. From this experience, produced by the economic struggle itself, derives the necessity for a <I>political struggle</I>, distinct from the economic struggle. Here things become more complicated, for workers cannot have an <I>experience of political reality</I> comparable to their everyday experience of the reality of economic exploitation, because the forms of intervention of class political power are often - with the exception of intermittent displays of overt violence - concealed under cover of the 'law', and juridical, moral, or religious justifications of the existence of the State. This is why the political struggle of the working class is much more difficult to <I>conceive</I> and to <I>organize</I> than its economic struggle. To lead and organize this struggle on its real terrain, it is necessary to have recognized - at least partially - the nature and role of the State in the class struggle, the relation between political domination and 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 36</B></FONT><P>

its juridical cover on the one hand, and economic exploitation on the other. For this, something more than intermittent, blind experience of certain effects of the existence of the class State is required: a <I>knowledge</I> of the mechanism of bourgeois society. In this domain, the 'spontaneous' conceptions of the proletariat, which govern their political actions, are significantly influenced by bourgeois conceptions, by the juridical, political and moral categories of the bourgeoisie. Whence the utopianism, anarchism and political reformism which can be observed not only at the outset of the political struggle of the working-class movement, but throughout its history. This anarchism and political reformism are incessantly perpetuated and renewed in the working class under the influence of the institutions and ideology of the bourgeoisie. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In the early stages of its political struggle, and in the very limits of that struggle, the working-class movement thus confronts <I>ideological realities</I>, dominated by the ideology of the bourgeois class. This accounts for the third aspect of the struggle of the working-class movement: <I>ideological struggle.</I> In social conflicts the working-class movement, like all other political movements, experiences this fact: every struggle implies the intervention of people's 'consciousness'; every struggle involves a conflict between <I>convictions</I>, <I>beliefs</I>, and <I>representations of the world.</I> Economic struggle and political struggle also imply these ideological conflicts. Ideological struggle is not limited, then, to a particular domain. By means of the representation people have of their world, their place, their role, their condition and their future, ideological struggle embraces the totality of human activities, all the domains of their struggle. Ideological struggle is ubiquitous, because it is indissociable from the conception that people have of their condition in all the forms of their struggle; it is indissociable from the ideas in which people live their relation to society and to its conflicts. There can be no economic or political struggle unless people commit their ideas to it as well as their strength. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Nevertheless, ideological struggle can and must also be considered as a struggle in a <I>specific domain: the domain of ideology</I>, the domain of religious, moral, juridical, political, aesthetic and philosophical ideas. In this regard, ideological struggle is distinct from other forms of struggle: its object is the terrain of the objective reality of <I>ideology</I>, and its goal is, as far as possible, to free this domain from the domination of bourgeois ideology and transform it, in order to make it serve the interests of the working-class movement. Considered thus, ideological struggle is also a specific struggle which unfolds in the domain of ideology and must take account of the nature of this terrain, of the nature and laws of ideology. Without <I>knowledge</I> of the nature, laws and specific mechanisms of ideology; without knowledge of the distinctions within ideology, of the -

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 37</B></FONT><P>

dominance of one region over others, of the different degrees (theorized, untheorized) of the existence of ideology; without knowledge of the class nature of ideology; without knowledge of the law of the domination of ideology by the ideology of the dominant class - without all this, ideological struggle is waged blindly. It can obtain some partial results, but never profound and definitive results. It is here that the limits of the natural, 'spontaneous' potential of the working-class movement are most strikingly revealed because, lacking scientific knowledge of the nature and social function of ideology, the 'spontaneous' ideological struggle of the working class is conducted on the basis of an ideology subjected to the insurmountable influence of the ideology of the bourgeois class. It is in the domain of ideological struggle that the necessity of an external intervention - <I>that of science</I> - is felt above all. This intervention is revealed to be even more important given that, as we have just seen, ideological struggle accompanies all other forms of struggle, and inasmuch as it is thus absolutely <I>decisive</I> for all forms of working-class struggle, since the <I>inadequacy of the ideological conceptions</I> of the working class left to itself produces anarchist, anarcho-syndicalist and reformist conceptions of its economic and political struggle. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We can sum up this analysis as follows. Independent of any influence by Marx's scientific theory, the very nature of the working-class movement commits it to a triple struggle: economic struggle, political struggle, ideological struggle. In the unity of these three distinct struggles, the general orientation of the struggle is fixed by the working class's representation of the nature of society and its evolution, the nature of the goals to be attained, and the means to be employed to wage the struggle successfully. The general orientation depends, then, on the ideology of the working-class movement. It is <I>this ideology</I> that directly governs the conception the working class has of its ideological struggle, and thus the manner in which it conducts the struggle to transform existing ideology; it is the ideology of the working class that directly governs its conception of its economic and political struggles, of their relations, and thus of the manner in which it conducts these struggles. At this level, everything depends on the <I>content of the ideology</I> of the working-class movement. Now, we know that this ideology remains a prisoner of the fundamental categories (religious, juridical, moral, political) of the dominant bourgeois class, <I>even in the way the 'spontaneous' ideology of the working class expresses its opposition to the dominant bourgeois ideology.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Accordingly, everything depends on the <I>transformation</I> of the ideology of the working class, on the transformation which can extricate working-class ideology from the influence of bourgeois ideology and 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 38</B></FONT><P>

submit it to a new influence - that of the <I>Marxist science of society.</I> It is precisely upon this point that the intervention of Marxist science in the working-class movement, and the union of Marxist science and the working-class movement, are founded and justified. And it is the very nature of ideology and its laws that determines the appropriate means to assure the transformation of the 'spontaneous' reformist ideology of the working-class movement into a new ideology, of a scientific and revolutionary character. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The necessity of this <I>transformation</I> of existing ideology, first of all in the working class itself, and then in the social strata that are its natural allies, allows us to comprehend the nature of the <I>means</I> of this transformation - <I>ideological struggle</I> and <I>theoretical formation.</I> These means constitute <I>two decisive links</I> in the union of Marxist theory and the working-class movement, and thus in the practice of the Marxist working-class movement. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <I>Ideological struggle</I> can be defined as struggle waged <I>in the objective domain of ideology</I>, <I>against</I> the domination of bourgeois ideology, <I>for</I> the transformation of existing ideology (the ideology of the working class, the ideology of the classes which may become its allies), in a way that serves the objective interests of the working-class movement in its struggle for revolution, and then in its struggle for the construction of socialism. Ideological struggle is a struggle <I>in</I> ideology; to be conducted on a correct theoretical basis, it presupposes knowledge of Marx's scientific theory as its absolute condition - it presupposes, then, <I>theoretical formation.</I> These two links - ideological struggle and theoretical formation - while both decisive, are thus not on the same plane; they imply a relation of domination and dependence. It is <I>theoretical formation</I> that governs ideological struggle, that is the theoretical and practical foundation of ideological struggle. In everyday practice, theoretical formation and ideological struggle constantly and necessarily intertwine. One may therefore be tempted to confuse them and misjudge their difference in principle, as well as their hierarchy. This is why it is necessary, from the theoretical perspective, to insist at once on the <I>distinction in principle</I> between <I>theoretical formation</I> and <I>ideological struggle</I>, and on the <I>priority in principle of theoretical formation</I> over ideological struggle. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is through theoretical formation that Marx's scientific doctrine has been able to penetrate the working-class movement; it is by permanent theoretical education that it continues to penetrate, and to reinforce itself in, the working-class movement. Theoretical formation is an essential task of Communist organizations, a permanent task, which must be pursued without respite and must be incessantly updated, taking account of the development and enrichment of Marxist scientific theory.

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 39</B></FONT><P>

It is easy to understand how absolutely indispensable this theoretical formation was in the past in winning the working-class movement to the scientific theory of Marx. Its importance is perhaps less clear <I>today</I>, when Marxist theory directly inspires the most important working-class organizations and the entire life of socialist countries. Nevertheless, despite these spectacular historical results, our theoretical task is not finished, and never can be. When we say that the ideology of the working class has been transformed by Marxist theory, this cannot mean that the working class, which was otherwise 'spontaneously' reformist, has become definitively Marxist today. Only the vanguard of the working class, its most conscious part, possesses a Marxist ideology. The great mass of the working class is still in part subject to an ideology of a reformist character. And among the vanguard of the working class itself, which forms the Communist Party, there exists great unevenness in the degree of theoretical consciousness. Among the vanguard of the working class only the best militants have a genuine theoretical formation - in the area of historical materialism at least - and it is among them that theoreticians and researchers capable of advancing Marxist scientific theory can be recruited. This constant unevenness in the degree of theoretical consciousness underlies the demand for a continually renewed and updated effort of theoretical formation in today's Marxist organizations. This reality also dictates an exact conception of theoretical formation, defined as rigorously as possible. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  By <I>theoretical formation</I>, we understand the process of education, study and work by which a militant is put in possession - <I>not only of the conclusions</I> of the two sciences of Marxist theory (historical materialism and dialectical materialism), <I>not only of their theoretical principles</I>, not only of some detailed analyses and demonstrations - but of <I>the totality</I> of the theory, of all its content, all its analyses and demonstrations, all its principles and all its conclusions, in their indissoluble scientific bond. We literally understand, then, a <I>thorough study and assimilation</I> of all the scientific works of primary importance on which the knowledge of Marxist theory rests. We might use a striking formula of Spinoza's to represent this objective: Spinoza said that a science solely of conclusions is not a science, that a true science is a science of premisses (principles) and conclusions in the integral movement of the demonstration of their necessity. Far from being an initiation to simple conclusions, or to principles on the one hand and conclusions on the other, theoretical formation is the thorough assimilation of the demonstration of conclusions on the basis of principles, the assimilation of the profound life of science in its spirit, in its very methods; it is a formation that endows those who receive and acquire it with the very scientific spirit that constitutes science, without which science would not be born, and 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 40</B></FONT><P>

would be unable to develop. Theoretical formation is thus something entirely different from simple economic, political or ideological formation. These must be preliminary stages of theoretical formation; they must be clarified by theoretical formation and founded upon it, but cannot be confused with it, because they are only <I>partial</I> stages of it. Practically speaking, there is no real theoretical formation without the study of Marxist science (theory of history, Marxist philosophy) in its purest existence - <I>not only in the texts of Lenin</I>, <I>but also in the work on which all Lenin's texts were based, and to which they constantly refer: Capital.</I> There is no real theoretical formation without an attentive, reflective and thorough study of the most important text of Marxist theory that we possess, a text which is far from having yielded to us all its riches. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Doubtless, theoretical formation thus defined may be considered an ideal - not accessible to everyone, given the great theoretical difficulties of reading and studying <I>Capital</I>, the degree of intellectual formation of militants, and the limited time we have to dedicate ourselves to this work. We can, and absolutely must, concretely envisage the successive and progressive degrees of theoretical formation, and strike a balance between them, according to people and circumstances. But arranging and realizing this balance itself presupposes the effective recognition of theoretical formation, its nature and its necessity; <I>it presupposes an absolutely clear knowledge of the ultimate objective of theoretical formation </I>: to form militants capable of one day becoming men and women of science. To attain this goal one cannot aim too high, and by aiming well and truly it will be possible to define precisely the degrees and appropriate means of progression conducive to this objective. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Why attach such importance to theoretical formation? Because it represents the <I>decisive intermediary link</I> by which it is possible both to develop Marxist theory itself, and to develop the influence of Marxist theory on the entire practice of the Communist Party and thus on the profound transformation of the ideology of the working class. It is this double reason that justifies the exceptional importance which Communist Parties have attributed in their past history, and must attribute in their present and future history, to theoretical formation. It is, in fact, by means of well-conceived theoretical formation that Communist militants - whatever their social origin - can become intellectuals in the strong sense of the term - that is, men and women of science, capable one day of advancing Marxist theoretical research. It is also the precise knowledge of Marxist science which <I>theoretical</I> formation represents that makes it possible to define and implement, on the basis of Marxist-Leninist science, the Party's economic and political activity and its ideological struggle (its objectives and its means).

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 41</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The Party is not content to <I>proclaim</I> its loyalty to the principles of Marxist-Leninist science. What radically distinguishes the Party from other working-class organizations is not this simple proclamation; it is the concrete, practical <I>application</I> of Marxist scientific theory - in the Party's forms of organization, in its means of action, in its scientific analyses of concrete situations. Not content with proclaiming principles, but applying them in action - this is what distinguishes the Party from other workers' organizations. What finally distinguishes the Party is that - even while recognizing the specificity and necessity of theory, of theoretical practice and theoretical research, and the proper conditions of their existence and exercise - the Party refuses to reserve the knowledge of theory as a monopoly for some specialists, leaders and intellectuals, thereby relegating its practical <I>application</I> to other militants. On the contrary, consistent with Marxist theory itself, the Party wants to unite theory with its practical application as widely as possible, for the good of theory and practice alike. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  That is why it must want to extend the broadest possible <I>theoretical formation</I> to the greatest possible number of militants; it must want to educate them constantly in theory, to make them militants in the full sense of the term - capable of analysing and understanding the situation in which they have to act, and thus of helping the Party to define its politics; and also capable, in their own practice, of making new observations and new experiences that will serve as already elaborated raw material on which other, more theoretically formed militants and the best Marxist theoreticians and researchers will work. To say that the entire orientation, and all the principles of action, of the Party rest on Marxist-Leninist theory; to say that practical experience of the political action of the masses and of the Party is indispensable to the development of theory - this is to affirm a fundamental truth which makes sense only if it takes a <I>concrete form</I>, if a <I>real and fruitful bond</I> is created in both directions - through necessary organizational measures - between theory and its development on the one hand, and the economic, political and ideological practice of the Party on the other. Creation of this bond is the Party's task. And the first, absolutely decisive, link of this bond is constituted by the most thorough <I>theoretical formation</I> of the greatest possible number of militants. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In all these matters, it is as imperative to conceive the <I>overall unity</I> of the organic process that relates scientific theory and revolutionary practice in both directions as it is to conceive the specific <I>distinction</I> of the different moments, and the articulation of this unity. Such a double conception is indispensable, as we have just seen, for <I>positive</I> reasons that are at once theoretical and practical. It is equally imperative to be on guard against <I>negative</I> confusions both in the domain of theory and 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 42</B></FONT><P>

in that of practice. We will fall into <I>idealism</I> pure and simple if theory is severed from practice, if theory is not given a practical existence - not only in its application, but also in the forms of organization and education that assure the passage of theory into practice and its realization in practice. We will fall into the same idealism if theory is not permitted, in its specific existence, to nourish itself from all the experiences, from all the results and real discoveries, of practice. But we will fall into another, equally grave form of idealism - <I>pragmatism</I> - if we do not recognize the irreplaceable specificity of <I>theoretical practice</I>, if we confuse theory with its application, if - not in words, but in <I>deeds</I> - we treat theory, theoretical research and theoretical formation as purely and simply auxiliary to practice, as 'servants of politics', if we construe theory as pure and simple commentary on immediate political practice. In these two forms of idealism, it can clearly be seen that disastrous practical consequences correspond to the errors of conception, consequences that can - as the history of the working-class movement has shown and still shows - gravely distort not only the working class's own practice, which may succumb to sectarianism or opportunism, but also theory itself, which may be doomed to the stagnation and regression of dogmatic or pragmatic idealism.

<P>
The correct distinction between theoretical formation and ideological struggle is thus essential in order to avoid falling into confusions which <I>all ultimately come down to taking ideology for science</I>, <I>and thus reducing science to ideology.</I> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  At the end of our analysis, then, we rejoin the cardinal principle with which we began: <I>the distinction between science and ideology.</I> Without this distinction it is impossible to understand the specificity of Marxism as a science, the nature of the union of Marxism and the working-class movement, and all the theoretical and practical consequences that flow therefrom. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It would be as well to remember that this analysis cannot pretend to be exhaustive; that it had to proceed by simplification and schematization; that it leaves a number of important problems unresolved. We hope that it may nevertheless furnish a correct idea of the decisive importance of the distinction between science and ideology, and of the light that this distinction sheds on a whole series of theoretical and practical problems which working-class and popular Marxist organizations have to confront and resolve in their struggle for the revolution, and for the transition to socialism.

I would like to expound, in some rapid pages, some of the difficulties encountered by any work of theoretical exposition of Marxist principles, before proceeding to an inventory of the resources - some well known, others sometimes misunderstood - at our disposal.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
<B>
1.&nbsp;Difficulties
</B>

<P>
Whatever the simplicity of its language and the clarity of its exposition, any Marxist theoretical treatise presents some specific and inevitable difficulties: inevitable because they pertain to the specific nature of theory or, more precisely, <I>theoretical discourse.</I>

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
 A.&nbsp;<I>Difficulty of the Terminology of Theoretical Discourse</I>

<P>
Marxism is at once a science (historical materialism) and a philosophy (dialectical materialism). Scientific discourse and philosophical discourse have their own requirements: they use the words of everyday language, or composite expressions constructed with the words of everyday language, but these words always function <I>otherwise</I> than they do in everyday language. In theoretical language, words and expressions function as <I>theoretical concepts.</I> To be precise, this implies that the meaning of words in such a language is not fixed by their ordinary usage but by the relations between theoretical concepts within a conceptual system. It is these relations that assign to words, designating concepts, their theoretical meaning. The peculiar difficulty of theoretical terminology pertains, then, to the fact that its <I>conceptual</I>  meaning must always be discerned behind the usual meaning of the word, and is always different from the latter. Now this difficulty is concealed for the unaware reader when the theoretical term purely and simply <I>reproduces</I> an ordinary term. For example, everyone thinks they immediately know what Marx means when he uses so ordinary a word as 'labour'. Yet it requires a great effort to discern, behind the common (ideological) obviousness of this word, the Marxist <I>concept</I> of labour - or better still, to see that the word 'labour' can designate <I>several</I> distinct concepts - the concepts of the labour process, labour power, concrete labour, abstract labour, etc.

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 46</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  When it is clear - that is, when it is firmly fixed and well marked off - a theoretical terminology assumes the precise function of preventing confusion between the normal meaning of words and the theoretical (conceptual) meaning of the same words. It performs this role above all by forging <I>composite expressions</I> that prevent the ideological confusion: thus labour process, abstract labour, mode of production, relations of production, etc.; in each of these expressions one finds only ordinary words (labour, concrete, abstract, mode, production, relations, etc.). It is their specific <I>conjunction</I> that produces a new, precise meaning, which is the theoretical concept. Something can be obtained from a theoretical discourse only on condition that it produces these specific expressions, which designate theoretical concepts. This is why, on our own account, we have had to propose some new expressions, as and when necessary, to designate concepts indispensable to the definition of our object (e.g. knowledge-effect, mode of theoretical production, etc.). We have done this with the greatest care, but we had to do it.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
B.&nbsp;<I>Difficulty of Theoretical Discourse</I>

<P>
The terminological difficulty is itself only the index of another, more profound difficulty, which has to do with the <I>theoretical</I> nature of our discourse. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  What is a theoretical discourse? In the most general sense, it is a discourse that results in the <I>knowledge</I> of an object. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  At this point, in order to make what follows intelligible, we must offer a few clarifications, anticipating theoretical developments that will be published later. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We shall say that, in the strong sense of the term, only particular real and concrete objects exist. At the same time, we shall say that the ultimate purpose of any theoretical discourse is 'concrete' knowledge (Marx) of these particular real and concrete objects. This is the sense in which abstract history or history in general does not exist (in the strong sense of the term) but only the real, concrete history of those concrete objects that are the particular concrete social formations we can observe in the accumulated experience of humanity. It is in this sense that production in general, abstract production, does not exist (Marx),<FONT SIZE=-2>[1]</FONT> but only this or that concrete-real conjunction-combination of hierarchically structured modes of production in this or that determinate social formation: the France of 1848 (Marx, <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/EBLB52.html">The Eighteenth Brumaire</A></I>, <I>Class</I>

<I>Struggles in France </I>); the Russia of 1905 or 1917 (Lenin); etc. All knowledge, and hence any theoretical discourse, has as its ultimate goal the knowledge of these particular concrete real objects: either their individuality (the structure of a social formation) or the modes of this individuality (the successive conjunctures in which this social formation exists). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  However - and this is the decisive point - we know that knowledge of these particular, concrete, real objects is not an immediate given, nor a simple abstraction, nor the <I>application</I> of general concepts to specific data. These are the positions of empiricism and idealism. Knowledge of particular, concrete, real objects is the result of an entire <I>process</I> of production of knowledge, whose outcome is what Marx calls 'the synthesis of many determinations' - this synthesis being the 'concrete knowledge' of a concrete object (1857 <I>Introduction </I>).<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp47">2</A>]</FONT> What does this 'synthesis', as Marx calls it, consist in? And what are these 'determinations'? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This synthesis consists in the correct combination-conjunction of two <I>types</I> of elements (or determinations) of knowledges, which, for the sake of clarity, we will for the moment call <I>theoretical</I> elements (in the strong sense) and <I>empirical</I> elements - or, in other terms, <I>theoretical</I> concepts (in the strong sense) and <I>empirical</I> concepts.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp47">3</A>]</FONT> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Theoretical concepts (in the strong sense) bear on abstract-formal determinations or objects. Empirical concepts concern the determinations of the singularity of concrete objects. Thus, we will say that the concept of <I>mode of production</I> is a theoretical concept which concerns the mode of production in general - an object which does not <I>exist</I> in the strong sense but is indispensable to the knowledge of any social formation, since every social formation is structured by the combination of several modes of production. In the same way, we will say that the concept of the <I>capitalist</I> mode of production is a theoretical concept, that it concerns the capitalist mode of production in general - an object that has no existence in the strong sense (in the strong sense, the capitalist mode of production does not exist, but only social formations dominated by the capitalist mode of production) but is none the less indispensable for the knowledge of any social formation characterized by the domination of what we call the capitalist mode of production, etc. The same goes for all Marx's theoretical concepts: mode of production, productive forces (or technical relations of production), social relations

of production, the political instance, the ideological instance, the concept of determination in the last instance by the economy, the concept of the articulation of instances, the concept of social formation, the concept of conjuncture, the concept of practice, of theory, etc. These concepts do not give us concrete knowledge of concrete objects, but knowledge of the <I>abstract-formal</I> determinations or elements (we will say objects) that are indispensable to the production of concrete knowledge of concrete objects. In saying that these are <I>abstract-formal</I> objects, we are only noting the terminology used by Marx himself, who in <I>Capital</I>, engaged in 'abstraction' and produced knowledge of 'forms' and 'developed forms'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp48">4</A>]</FONT> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Empirical concepts bear on the determinations of the singularity of concrete objects - that is, on the <I>fact</I> that such a social formation presents such and such a configuration, traits, particular arrangements, which characterize it as <I>existing.</I> Empirical concepts thus add something essential to concepts that are theoretical in the strong sense: precisely the determinations of the existence (in the strong sense) of concrete objects. It might be thought that with this distinction we have reintroduced, under the guise of theoretical concepts, something resembling empiricism - namely, <I>empirical</I> concepts. This term (which will be modified in subsequent works to avoid any ambiguity) must not lead us into error. Empirical concepts are not pure <I>givens</I>, not the pure and simple tracing, not the pure and simple immediate reading, of reality. They are themselves the result of a whole process of knowledge, containing several levels or degrees of elaboration. Of course, these empirical concepts express the absolute requirement that no concrete knowledge can do without observation, experiment, and the data they provide (this corresponds to the gigantic empirical research, bearing on 'the facts', of Marx, Engels and Lenin, and to the concrete <I>investigations and inquiries</I> that sustained every 'concrete analysis of a concrete situation' for all the great leaders of the working-class movement. But at the same time they are irreducible to the pure data of an immediate empirical investigation. An investigation or an observation is in fact never passive: it is possible only under the direction and control of theoretical concepts directly or indirectly active in it - in its rules of observation, selection, classification, in the <I>technical</I> setting that constitutes the field of observation or experiment. Thus, an investigation or an observation, even an experiment, first of all only furnishes the <I>materials</I> which are then worked up into the <I>raw material</I> of a subsequent labour

of transformation that is finally going to produce <I>empirical</I> concepts. By 'empirical concepts', then, we do not mean the initial <I>material</I> but the result of successive elaborations; we mean the result of a process of knowledge, itself complex, wherein the initial material, and then the raw material obtained, are transformed into empirical concepts by the effect of the intervention of <I>theoretical concepts</I> - present either explicitly, or at work within this transformative process in the form of experimental settings, rules of method, of criticism and interpretation, etc.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp49">5</A>]</FONT> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  In no case is the relation of theoretical concepts to empirical concepts a relation of exteriority (theoretical concepts are not 'reduced' to empirical data), or a relation of deduction (empirical concepts are not deduced from theoretical concepts), or a relation of subsumption (empirical concepts are not the complementary <I>particularity</I> - the specific cases - of the <I>generality</I> of theoretical concepts). Rather, it should be said (in a sense close to Marx's expression when talking about the 'realization of surplus-value') that empirical concepts 'realize' theoretical concepts in the concrete knowledge of concrete objects. The dialectic of this 'realization' - which has nothing to do with the Hegelian concept of the speculative 'realization' of the Idea in the concrete - will obviously demand sustained clarification, which can be produced only on the basis of a theory of the practice of the sciences, and of their history. Be that as it may, we can say that the concrete knowledge of a concrete object indeed appears to us as the 'synthesis' of which Marx spoke: a synthesis of the requisite theoretical concepts (in the strong sense) combined with elaborated empirical concepts. There is no concrete knowledge of a concrete object without the necessary recourse to the knowledge of those specific objects that correspond to the abstract-formal concepts of theory in the strong sense. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For the moment, these specific points suffice for introducing an important distinction between the possible objects of a theoretical discourse. If we retain the distinction just advanced between abstract-formal objects and concrete-real objects, we may say that a theoretical discourse can, according to its <I>level</I>, bear either on abstract and formal objects, or on concrete and real objects. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For example, the <I>scientific</I> analysis of a concrete historical reality - the French social formation in 1966 - will indeed constitute a theoretical discourse in the general sense, since it provides us with a knowledge. But in that case, it will be said that the discourse concerns a <I>real-concrete</I>

object. On the other hand, Marx's <I>Capital</I> does not analyse a social formation (a real concrete society), but <I>the capitalist mode of production </I>; it will be said that it concerns a <I>formal</I> or <I>abstract</I> object. We can conceive of a large number of theoretical discourses bearing on formal or abstract objects: on the concept of mode of production, for example; or on the instances that constitute a mode of production (economic, political, ideological); or on the forms of transition from one mode of production to another; etc. A discourse on the general principles of Marxist theory also bears on a formal or abstract object: it does not treat some concrete object (this social formation, that conjuncture of the class struggle) but the principles - i.e. the theoretical concepts - of Marxism, formal-abstract objects. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If all discourses that produce knowledge of an object can be called, in general, theoretical, we must accordingly make a very important distinction between discourses concerning real-concrete objects, on the one hand, and discourses concerning formal-abstract objects, on the other. It will be helpful to designate as theoretical discourse, or <I>theory in the strong sense</I>, discourses bearing on formal-abstract objects. This distinction is necessary: on the one hand, the first kind of discourse (concrete) presupposes the existence of the second (abstract); on the other, the <I>scope</I> of the second kind of discourse (abstract) infinitely exceeds the object of the first kind. This is quite clear in the case of Marx's theoretical discourse in <I>Capital.</I> The <I>theory</I> of the capitalist mode of production (a formal-abstract object) - theory in the strong sense - in fact permits knowledge of a great number of real-concrete objects, in this case knowledge of all social formations, all real societies, structured by the capitalist mode of production. On the other hand, the (concrete) knowledge of a real object (e.g. France in 1966) does not <I>ipso facto</I> allow knowledge of another real object (England in 1966) unless one makes recourse to the <I>theory</I> (in the strong sense) of the capitalist mode of production - that is, unless one extracts from the first concrete knowledge the abstract knowledge at work therein. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  From these remarks - difficult, to be sure, but clear, I hope - we can draw two conclusions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  First, that a discourse on the general principles of Marxism is, in its very limits, a <I>theoretical</I> discourse <I>in the strong sense</I>, since it does not address some real-concrete object (e.g. the class struggle in France, or the history of the 'cult of personality', etc.), but a formal-abstract object: the fundamental principles of Marxism, considered independently of any real-concrete object. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Second, that the specificity of <I>theory in the strong sense</I> is precisely to be concerned with a formal-<I>abstract</I> object or objects - that is, not to produce 'concrete' knowledge of real-concrete objects, but knowledge

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 51</B></FONT><P>

of formal-abstract or theoretical objects (in the strong sense), of concepts of theoretical relations and conceptual systems, which then can and must intervene, at a second stage, to work towards the knowledge of real-concrete objects. To say that a theoretical knowledge, or theory in the strong sense, concerns formal-abstract objects, concepts and theoretical conceptual systems means that it possesses the specific capacity to provide the theoretical instruments indispensable to the concrete knowledge of a whole series of <I>possible</I> real-concrete objects. In having formal-abstract objects for its object, theory in the strong sense thus bears on <I>possible</I> real objects: both on some current, present social formation or 'concrete situation' (Lenin) here and now, but also on some other past or future social formation or concrete situation, in some other place - as long as those real objects do indeed come under the abstract concepts of the theory in question. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Such is the difficulty of <I>theory.</I> We must never lose sight of the fact that, understood in the strong sense, theory is never reducible to the real examples invoked to <I>illustrate</I> it, since it goes beyond any given real object, since it concerns all <I>possible</I> real objects within the province of its concepts. The difficulty of theory in the strong sense derives, then, from the abstract and formal character not just of its concepts, but of its objects. To do Marxist theory in the strong sense, to define the fundamental theoretical principles of Marxism, is to work on abstract objects, to define abstract objects for example, the following abstract objects: materialism, historical materialism, dialectical materialism, science, philosophy, dialectic, mode of production, relations of production, labour process, abstract labour, concrete labour, surplus-value, the structure of the economic, the political, the ideological and theoretical mode of production, theoretical practice, theoretical formation, union of theory and practice, etc., etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Naturally, the knowledge of formal-abstract objects has nothing to do with a speculative and contemplative knowledge concerning 'pure' ideas. On the contrary, it is solely concerned with <I>real</I>  objects; it is meaningful <I>solely</I> because it allows the forging of theoretical instruments, formal and abstract theoretical concepts, which permit production of the knowledge of real-concrete objects. Of course, this knowledge of formal-abstract objects does not fall from the sky or from the 'human spirit'; it is the product of a <I>process of theoretical labour</I>, it is subject to a material history, and includes among its determinant conditions and elements non-theoretical practices (economic, political and ideological) and their results. But, once produced and constituted, the formal-theoretical objects can and must serve as the object of a theoretical labour in the strong sense, must be analysed, thought in their necessity, their internal relations, and developed in order to draw from 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 52</B></FONT><P>

them all the consequences - that is, all their wealth. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Marx provided us with an example of such work in <I>Capital </I>: there, an analysis of a formal-abstract object (the capitalist mode of production) is used to develop all its '<I>forms </I>', and to draw out all its consequences. It is because Marx accomplished this theoretical work, in the strong sense - i.e., produced knowledge of the formal-abstract object that is the capitalist mode of production, of all its '<I>forms </I>' and consequences - that we can <I>know</I> what happens in <I>real</I> objects - social formations which fall under the capitalist mode of production. We must go still further. In working on the theoretical object <I>capitalist mode of production</I>, Marx also and at the same time worked on a more general theoretical object: the concept of <I>mode of production.</I> This permits us, in turn, to work on this object, then on other objects, knowledge of which the concept makes possible - modes of production other than the capitalist mode of production, the feudal mode of production, the socialist mode of production, etc. - and even on an object required by Marx's thought, although he never arrived at it: the concept of <I>theoretical mode of production</I> and subsidiary concepts. This, on the condition that we know that in working on these other concepts of modes of production, we are still working on formal-abstract objects. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Such is the fundamental difficulty of <I>theory</I>, of any theoretical discourse, in the strong sense. Naturally, this difficulty offends common sense, because it introduces a paradoxical innovation: the idea that one can attain the knowledge of real-concrete objects only on the condition of working also and at the same time on formal-abstract objects. Therewith, this difficulty introduces the idea of a very specific form of existence: that of formal-abstract objects, distinct from the form of existence of real-concrete objects. It is not <I>easy</I> to grasp this idea, which is the very idea of theory in the strong sense. Above all, it is not <I>easy</I> to take this idea into account, practically and constantly, when reading a theoretical text. It requires a real effort to resist the temptations of empiricism (for which only real-concrete objects exist), to adopt the critique of its ideological 'facts', genuinely to criticize them, and to situate oneself at the level of <I>theory</I> - i.e. of its formal-abstract objects.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
C.&nbsp;<I>Difficulty of Theoretical Method</I>

<P>
Another difficulty specific to theory pertains not to its object but to <I>the way</I> in which it treats its object - that is, to its <I>method.</I> It is not enough, in fact, that a discourse treats a theoretical (formal-abstract) object for it to be called theoretical in the strong sense. A theoretical object can, for example, just as well be treated by an ideological or pedagogical discourse. What distinguishes these discourses is their mode of treating

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 53</B></FONT><P>

their theoretical object, their <I>method.</I> For example, a discourse like Stalin's little treatise (on dialectical and historical materialism),<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp53">6</A>]</FONT> which played a big role, since it taught Marxism to millions of militants over dozens of years, treats its object by a pedagogical method. It expounds the fundamental principles of Marxism, and in a generally correct manner. It offers the essential definitions, and above all makes the essential distinctions. It has the merit of being clear and simple, and thus accessible to the broad masses. But it exhibits the great defect of <I>enumerating</I> the principles of Marxism, without demonstrating the necessity of the 'order of exposition' (Marx) - that is, without demonstrating the internal necessity that links these principles, these concepts. Now the order (of exposition), which connects these concepts to each other, pertains to their necessary relations, these relations to their very properties: this order constitutes their <I>system</I>, which gives its real meaning to each of the concepts. For example, if the <I>distinction</I> between Marxist science (historical materialism) and Marxist philosophy (dialectical materialism) is clearly marked in Stalin's text, their internal relation and the specific necessity of their relation are not really thought through and demonstrated. For example, if the principles of materialism and of the dialectic are indeed affirmed, their internal, necessary relation is neither expounded nor demonstrated in its specific content. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  For practical, <I>de facto</I> reasons a pedagogical method of exposition can assuredly leave certain of these relations - if not the necessary system that links the concepts and gives them their sense - in the shade. For <I>de jure</I> reasons, a theoretical method of exposition cannot do this. It must rigorously expound the necessity of these relations; that is its purpose. Marx was perfectly conscious of this in <I>Capital</I>, when he said that the '<I>method of exposition </I>', as distinct from the method of investigation (or method of research and discovery) was an integral part of all scientific (we can add: and philosophical) discourse - that is, of all theoretical discourse.<FONT SIZE=-2>[7]</FONT> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The difficulty of a theoretical discourse in the strong sense derives, on the one hand, from the formal-abstract nature of its object, and on the other, from the rigour of its 'order' - that is, its method of exposition. What was said of the object must equally be said of the method: like the object, it is necessarily formal-abstract. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Of course, this does not mean that a theoretical discourse must constantly remain at the level of theoretical abstraction alone. It can be illustrated by a great many possible 'concrete' examples. Here again,

Marx showed us the way in <I>Capital </I>: he continually <I>illustrates</I> his analysis of the capitalist mode of production with examples drawn from a real-concrete object, the nineteenth-century British social formation. We have a perfect right to resort to this method of illustration, which is pedagogically sound and may play an important role in certain conditions. But we may do this only on the condition that we carefully distinguish the theoretical analysis of our theoretical (abstract) object from all its concrete 'illustrations', that we know that the object of theory in the strong sense cannot be reduced to, or <I>confused with</I>, the real objects used to illustrate it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  If care is not taken to treat illustrations for what they are - illustrations only, and not concrete knowledges in the sense we have defined along with Marx - one risks falling into misunderstandings, like the celebrated misunderstanding to which many historians who read <I>Capital</I> fall victim. A historian looks for the concrete knowledge of a concrete object: some social formation in some conjuncture or in the dialectic of conjunctures that cover an entire period. Now <I>Capital apparently</I> contains some chapters of concrete history: on labour in England and the history of manufacture and industry; on primitive accumulation, etc. One may be tempted to see in this the Marxist theory of history at work in empirical concepts produced and displayed before our very eyes. Now if these chapters have so fascinated historians, it is precisely because they are not chapters of concrete Marxist history in the proper sense; it is because they bear a fraternal resemblance to the empirical chronological descriptions in which ordinary ideological history abounds. Marx does not in fact present them to us as chapters of a Marxist history, but as simple <I>illustrations</I> of  <I>theoretical</I> concepts: the concepts of absolute and relative surplus-value, and of the non-capitalist origin of capitalism. In these pseudo-chapters of concrete history, he confined himself to giving us what he had to: facts designed to illustrate - that is, to repeat in empirical reality - a concept (labour in England) or partial genealogies (the transition from primitive accumulation to large-scale industry). As has been powerfully demonstrated,<FONT SIZE=-2>[8]</FONT> these are elements for a concrete history - either materials or raw material for a Marxist history - but not chapters of Marxist history. If we want examples of concrete Marxist history, we must look for them where they are to be found: in Marx's historical works (<I>The Eighteenth Brumaire</I>, etc.), or in Lenin's historical analyses (<I><A HREF="../Lenin/DCR99tc.html">The Development of Capitalism in Russia</A></I>, etc.) and the great political analyses from 1917 to 1922.

the confusions between a concrete illustration of a theoretical concept and Marxist history.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>
D.&nbsp;<I>Final Difficulty: the Revolutionary Novelty of the Theory</I>

<P>
To conclude this section on difficulties, we must offer yet another reason - the most important - for the difficulty of Marxist theoretical work. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  A theoretical text on Marx contains another difficulty besides that which pertains to the theoretical nature of its object or its method. This further difficulty is the revolutionary novelty of <I>Marxist</I> theory. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We have seen what threatens the <I>words</I> used by a theoretical discourse: a rapid reading may construe them as having the same meaning they would possess in everyday life, when they actually have an entirely different meaning - that of <I>theoretical concepts.</I> We have seen what threatens the object of a theoretical discourse in the strong sense: a rapid reading can take this object as a real-concrete object, when it actually possesses an entirely different nature - that of a formal-abstract object. In these two cases, the specificity of theoretical language (terminology) and of the theoretical object is reduced and destroyed by the intervention of familiar 'obvious facts': those of 'everyday' ideology - i.e., of empiricist ideology. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We cannot have any illusions about this: it cannot be otherwise for Marxist theory. It is not only Marxist theory's sworn adversaries who loudly proclaim that it has <I>contributed nothing new </I>; it is also Marxism's partisans, when they read Marx's texts and 'interpret' Marxist theory through the established 'self-evident truths', those of the reigning ideological theories. To take only two examples, Marxists who <I>spontaneously</I> - without difficulties, scruples, or hesitation - read and interpret Marxist theory within the schemes of <I>evolutionism</I> or <I>humanism in fact</I> declare that Marx contributed nothing new - at least in philosophy and, by implication, in science - regarding the method of conceiving theoretical objects, and hence their structure. These Marxists reduce the prodigious philosophical novelty of Marx's thought to existing, ordinary, 'obvious' forms of thought - that is, to forms of the dominant theoretical ideology. In order clearly to perceive and grasp the revolutionary novelty of Marxist philosophy and its scientific consequences, it is necessary lucidly to resist this ideological reduction, to combat the ideology that supports it, and to state what distinguishes the specificity of Marx's thought, what makes it a revolutionary thought, not only in politics, but also in theory. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This is where the last difficulty resides. For it is not easy to break with the 'self-evident truths' of theoretical ideologies like evolutionism or 'humanism', which have dominated all of Western thought for two hundred years. It is not easy to say that Marx was not Hegelian 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 56</B></FONT><P>

(Hegelianism is the 'rich man's' evolutionism), that Marx was not evolutionist, that Marx was not theoretically 'humanist'; it is not easy to show <I>positively how</I> Marx, because he is neither Hegelian nor 'humanist', is something else entirely, something which must then be <I>defined.</I> And when one tries to show this, it is not easy to make it understood and have it acknowledged. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Any theoretical text, however limited, that treats Marxist principles <I>inevitably</I> contains this fundamental difficulty. Unless we are going to cede to the false 'self-evidence' of the dominant theoretical ideologies (whether evolutionism, humanism, or other forms of idealism) and thus betray the most precious aspect of Marx's thought - what makes it <I>theoretically</I> revolutionary - we must confront this difficulty, and struggle against the ideologies that continually threaten to suffocate, reduce and destroy Marxist thought. This is not an imaginary difficulty; it is an objective historical difficulty, as real in its way as the difficulties of revolutionary practice. The world does not undergo 'fundamental' change <I>easily </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp56">9</A>]</FONT> - neither the social world, nor the world of thought. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We know that a revolution is first of all required for the social world to 'change fundamentally'. But after the revolution, it is further necessary to undertake an extremely long, arduous struggle, in politics and ideology, to establish and consolidate the new society, and make it prevail. The same goes for the world of thought. Following a theoretical revolution, another extremely long and arduous struggle is required, in theory and ideology, to establish the new thought, have it recognized and make it prevail, especially if a form of thought that founds a new ideology and a new political practice is involved. Prior to the success of this struggle, the revolution in society, like the revolution in thought, runs a very great risk: of being smothered by the old world and, directly or indirectly, falling back under its sway. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It will be understood why, again today, it would require a real effort to represent accurately the theoretical revolution accomplished by Marx in philosophy and in science, against the old ideologies that tend constantly to submit this revolution to their own law - that is, to smother and destroy it. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This is why, although one certainly wants to take account of the bad reasons (errors, omissions, awkwardness and limits), any theoretical work will also have good reasons, inevitable and necessary reasons, for sometimes being <I>difficult</I> - reasons that pertain on the one hand to the theoretical nature of its object and its method, and on the other to the revolutionary novelty of Marx's thought.

<P>
But another question arises here. When we propose to attempt to define and expound the principles of Marxism, we do not claim to invent them but to resume them, to analyse and develop them. In order to be available for definition and exposition, these principles must already exist and be at our disposal, in some way or another. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This condition seems obvious. We are reflecting on what Marx gave us. In order to speak of the principles of Marxist theory and practice, it seems sufficient, then, to obtain these principles <I>from where they are to be found </I>: in Marxist theory and Marxist practice. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Yet this response, in its simplicity, poses a certain number of important problems, which touch on the very nature of the principles of Marxism.

  1.&nbsp;We will first of all obtain Marxist principles where they are produced and set forth: in the theoretical works of Marx and his important disciples. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Yet we need only know a little about these works to see that reading them immediately raises a certain number of difficulties. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The first of these difficulties concerns the works of Marx himself. In fact, there are some very tangible theoretical differences between Marx's first works (the so-called 'philosophical' or 'Early' works) and the later works, such as the <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/CM47.html">Manifesto</A></I>, the <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/PP47.html">Poverty of Philosophy</A></I>, the <I>Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</I>, <I>Capital</I>, etc. Similarly, there are tangible differences in object between these two groups of works. For example, Marx talks directly and at length about philosophy and ideology in the works of his youth and in <I>The German Ideology</I>, but talks of these very little, if at all, in <I>Capital.</I> If we want to obtain some Marxist principles concerning philosophy or ideology, to which texts do we refer? To the texts that speak of these directly and explicitly, whatever their date, or to other, subsequent texts that have the great inconvenience of speaking very little, or not at all, about such concerns? 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  To obtain the principles of Marxism from Marx, then, we must have posed and resolved this preliminary problem: which of Marx's texts can be taken as Marxist? In other words, we must have asked Marx himself a simple and perfectly natural question: from what moment, from which work, did Marx - who, like any bourgeois intellectual of the 1840s necessarily thought in the dominant (idealist) ideology - break with that ideology, at what moment did he lay the foundations of his revolutionary theory? It is evident that if we take the content and the letter of the texts prior to this rupture and this revolution as Marxist - for example, the idealist and humanist texts of his youth - we remain fascinated by 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 58</B></FONT><P>

the fetishism of the <I>signature</I>, and regress to a pre-Marxist position; it is not Marx's signature but Marx's 'thought', in the strong sense, which authenticates a text as Marxist. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   To identify the pre-Marxist and the Marxist texts, clearly to distinguish these two series of texts - this is a project that presupposes an entire labour of critique on Marx's work itself. This indispensable critical work has been commenced.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp58">10</A>]</FONT> It must be understood that any discourse on Marxist theory <I>presupposes</I> this preliminary work of critique. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   If we take this preliminary work seriously, this implies that we are then able to answer a second question: can we derive certain Marxist principles from the Marxist works of Marx (e.g. <I>Capital </I>), even if these works do not directly or explicitly treat or state these principles? By what right, and via what procedures, may we do this? Let us consider, for example, the Marxist conception of <I>philosophy </I>: the question of philosophy abounds in the Early Works, and in <I>The German Ideology</I>, but little, if anything, is said about it in <I>Capital.</I> If we know that the works of Marx's youth are not 'Marxist', we will not take their formulations on philosophy as Marxist; we will not be able to retain them. We will turn to <I>Capital</I> in search of what defines Marxist philosophy. Now, <I>Capital</I> does not give us the principles of Marxist philosophy in person, since it does not treat philosophy; the capitalist mode of production, not philosophy, is its object. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Nevertheless, Marxist philosophy is very much present in <I>Capital</I>, which is a '<I>realization </I>' of it. We will say, then, that Marxist philosophy can be found there, because it is <I>at work</I> there. We will say that Marxist philosophy exists in <I>Capital 'in the practical state'</I>, that it is present in the theoretical practice of <I>Capital</I> - to be precise, in the way the object of <I>Capital</I> is conceived, in the <I>way</I> its problems are posed, in the <I>way</I> they are treated and resolved. The expression '<I>in the practical state </I>' should not mislead us. In this case, the expression designates a mode of existence of philosophy in a <I>scientific</I> work, in a theoretical practice, thus a <I>theoretical</I> mode of existence, and not (something we shall encounter shortly) a mode of existence in a <I>political</I> and historical work, hence 'practical' in the usual sense of the term. The existence of Marxist philosophy '<I>in the practical state </I>' in <I>Capital</I> designates the particular modality of the existence of the object, the problems, the scientific and thus theoretical method, of <I>Capital.</I> To say that Marxist philosophy is found in a practical state in <I>Capital</I> signifies, then, that the content of Marxist philosophy is indeed present in <I>Capital</I>, but that it lacks its

theoretical <I>form.</I> Dialectical materialism (Marxist philosophy) is not dealt with there in its own right, as a distinct entity independent of historical materialism (science of history), but in, by, and through this chapter of historical materialism, which analyses the essence of the capitalist mode of production. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is the existence of Marxist philosophy 'in the practical state' in <I>Capital</I> that authorizes us to 'derive' the Marxist conception of philosophy from <I>Capital.</I> If Marxist philosophy were not present in  Capital</I>, we could not derive it therefrom. If it were present there, not only in its content but also in its form, spelled out explicitly, we would not need to 'derive' it. Since it is present therein in the 'practical state' (content), but not in the theoretical state (form), we must endow its content with its proper form. To do that we must identify its content, and give it its corresponding form. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This work is a real theoretical work: not merely a work of simple <I>extraction</I>, <I>abstraction</I> in the empiricist sense, but a work of elaboration, transformation and production, which requires considerable effort. At least we can carry out this work, once we know that Marxist philosophy can really exist, in actuality, <I>in the practical state</I>, independently of its form and thus of its <I>theoretical</I> formulation. And when we affirm this possibility, we should know that we are affirming not only a fact ('it is thus') but a fundamental principle of Marxism itself, a principle that ultimately concerns the relation between a philosophy and a science, the relation between theory and practice: the principle which holds that philosophy exists first of all in the <I>practice</I> of the sciences, before existing for itself. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Everyone will understand that what has just been said regarding the principles of Marxist philosophy applies to a great many other principles of Marxism: we often find ourselves obliged to 'derive' them, by a protracted labour of theoretical elaboration, transformation and production, from the 'practical state' in which they are given to us in the texts of Marx and his successors. What applies to certain essential principles (e.g. philosophy, the union of theory and practice, etc.) obviously applies, <I>a fortiori</I>, to their consequences. Marx did not 'say everything', not only because he did not have the time, but because to 'say everything' makes no sense for a scientist: only a religion can pretend to 'say everything'. On the contrary, a scientific theory, by definition, always has <I>something else</I> to say, since it exists only in order to discover, in the very solution of problems, as many, if not more, problems than it resolves. Thus, in order to define certain Marxist concepts and their consequences, we will often have to 'derive' them from the works of Marx and his successors, and to extend their effects by a complex labour of theoretical elaboration and production. 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 60</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This indispensable and difficult work has been begun elsewhere, in a rudimentary and imperfect form.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp60">11</A>]</FONT> But we must understand that any discourse on Marxist theory presupposes this work, without which we would go no further than resetting and rededicating the 'foundation stone' (Lenin)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp60">12</A>]</FONT> laid by Marx. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Of course - and this is an absolutely determinant remark - we are not alone before Marx's works, and before <I>Capital.</I> The work of elaboration to which I have just alluded has been under way for a long time, and its results are to be found in the theoretical works of Marx's main disciples. For example, we find something in Engels and Lenin that explicitly and directly takes up certain of the principles which are found only in the 'practical state' in <I>Capital.</I> <I><A HREF="../M&amp;E/AD78.html">Anti-D&uuml;hring</A></I>, <I>The Dialectics of Nature</I>, and <I><A HREF="../Lenin/MEC08NB.html">Materialism and Empirio-criticism</A></I> allow us to pose in much more explicit terms the problem of the nature of Marxist philosophy, of the relation between theory and practice, etc., that remained implicit in <I>Capital.</I> The same applies to other principles pertaining to historical materialism - for example the concept of <I>social formation</I>, the concept of the <I>combination of several modes of production in every social formation </I>: Lenin formulated these, 'deriving' them from Marx through a rigorous theoretical examination, etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Any work on Marxist theory must commence by carefully identifying and recording the results we owe to Marx and to his successors, and furthering this effort within the objective and subjective limits of possibility. Of course, we must apply the same method of theoretical 'extraction-elaboration' to the works of Marx's successors. We will thus come to 'derive' such-and-such theoretical elements present in the 'practical state' in these works, in order to impart an adequate theoretical form to their theoretical content. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It will be understood that this work - if it is not a simple 'extraction', but a genuine elaboration - is rarely limited to the production of a made-to-order <I>form</I>, just the right match for a ready-and-waiting <I>content.</I> To believe that it is simply a matter of <I>identifying</I> an already adequate content, in order then to provide it with the appropriate form, as one chooses a suit according to the size of a customer, is insufficient. There is no pure content. Any content is always already given in a certain form. To give an adequate form to a theoretical content existing 'in a practical state' almost always presupposes, then, two conjoint operations: the critical rectification of the old form and the production of the new, in one and the same process. This means that the production

</FONT>

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 61</B></FONT><P>

of the new, <I>more</I> adequate, theoretical form presupposes the critique of the old - the perception of its inadequacy and of the reasons for that inadequacy. This means that a work of theoretical elaboration - even one bearing on theoretical contents existing in a theoretical discourse in the 'practical state' - presupposes a critical rectification of what is given in the practical state. There is nothing surprising about this: this is how any theoretical discipline proceeds in its development. A science or philosophy that is new, even revolutionary, always begins somewhere - in a certain universe of extant, and thus historically and theoretically determined, concepts and words; it is by means of the available concepts and terms that any new, even revolutionary, theory must find what it requires in order to think and express its radical novelty. Even in order to think <I>against</I> the content of the old universe of thought, any new theory is condemned to think its new content in <I>certain</I> of the forms of the existing theoretical universe which it is going to overturn. Neither Marx nor his successors escaped this condition, which governs the dialectic of all theoretical production. This is why we have not only to remove the pre-Marxist content of the thought of the young Marx, but also to criticize, in the name of the logic and coherence of the system of Marxist principles, certain of the <I>forms</I> in which the new content is presented. Evidently, this rule also applies to certain <I>forms</I> of existence of Marxist theoretical principles 'in the practical state' in the mature works of Marx and his successors. This is why any production of an adequate form for a theoretical content 'in the practical state' is in fact, at the same time, a critical <I>rectification</I> of the old form, wherein this content existed 'in the practical state'. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The important thing to grasp here is that this operation of critical rectification is not imposed <I>from without</I> on the works of Marx and his successors, but results from the <I>application</I> of these works <I>to themselves </I>; very specifically, it results from the <I>application</I> of their more elaborated forms to their less elaborated forms - or, if one prefers, of their more elaborated concepts to their less elaborated concepts, or again, of their theoretical system to certain terms of their discourse, etc. This operation reveals some 'blanks', 'plays on words', lacunae, inadequacies, which rectification can then reduce. All this work proceeds concurrently: it is by bringing to light the most elaborated forms and concepts, the theoretical system, etc., that rectification can be carried out, and it is rectification that foregrounds forms, concepts and systems which determine its objects. Is it necessary to give some examples? It is the <I>application</I> of the conceptual system of <I>Capital</I> to the conceptual system of the young Marx's <I>Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts</I> that makes visible the theoretical break between the two texts; it is in this way, to be quite precise, by the application of the 

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 62</B></FONT><P>

concept of 'wage labour' (which figures in <I>Capital </I>) to the concept of 'alienated labour' (which figures in the Paris <I>Manuscripts </I>), that the ideological, non-scientific character of the concept of 'alienated labour' - and thus of the concept of 'alienation' that supports it - becomes visible. In the same way, within <I>Capital</I> itself, it is by the <I>application</I> of the well-defined concepts of labour process, labour-power, concrete labour, abstract labour, wage labour, etc., to the concept of '<I>labour </I>' (also found in <I>Capital </I>), that one discovers this concept of 'labour' (by itself) to be, <I>in Capital</I>, only a word, one of the old <I>forms</I> belonging to the conceptual system of classical political economy and Hegelian philosophy. Marx made use of it, but to lead to some new concepts which, in <I>Capital</I> itself, render this form superfluous and constitute its critique. It is extremely important to know this in order to avoid taking this word (labour) for a Marxist concept; otherwise, as many current examples attest, one may be tempted to erect upon it all the idealist and spiritualistic interpretations of Marxism as philosophy of labour, of the 'creation of man by man', of humanism, etc. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Such, then, is the <I>first response</I> that can be given to the question: where are we to obtain the principles of Marxism? - <I>from the theoretical works of Marx and his successors.</I> On condition, first of all, of having accurately identified those works of Marx that are Marxist. On condition, next, of knowing that Marxist principles can be given to us in those works either in person, in an adequate theoretical form, or in another form, in the practical state. On condition, finally, of knowing that to 'derive' certain of the principles of Marxism from the works of Marx and his successors, especially when those principles are there in a practical state, presupposes an elaboration that must sometimes take the form of a work of critical <I>rectification.</I>

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  2.&nbsp;All this, however, concerns only the <I>theoretical</I> works among the classics of Marxism. We must now speak of something else: the <I>practical</I> works of Marxism - that is, the political practice of the organizations of class struggle born of the union of Marxist theory and the workers' movement, and its results. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  We have shown that Marxist principles can exist 'in the practical state' in the <I>theoretical</I> works of Marxism. Now it must be shown that they can also exist 'in the practical state' in the <I>practical</I> works of Marxism. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The political practice of Communist Parties can in fact contain, in the practical state, certain Marxist principles, or certain of their theoretical consequences, which are not to be found in existing theoretical analyses. From the viewpoint of the <I>theoretical content</I> itself, the political practice of organizations of class struggle can thus find itself - in certain cases

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 63</B></FONT><P>

and on certain points, and sometimes very considerably - <I>in advance</I> of existing theory. One can then 'derive', from the political practice that contains them, theoretical elements in advance of the state of existing theory. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Of course, it is not a matter of just any 'spontaneous' practice, but of the practice of revolutionary parties that base their organization and their action on Marxist theory. Of course, it is not a matter of just any of these practices 'based' on Marxist theory, but of a practice whose relation to Marxist theory is correct.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp63">13</A>]</FONT> With this dual qualification in mind, the political practice of a revolutionary party, the structure of its organization, its objectives, the forms of its action, its leadership of the class struggle, its historical achievements, etc., constitute the <I>realization</I> of Marxist theory in determinate real-concrete conditions. As these principles are theoretical, if this realization is <I>correct</I>, it inevitably produces results of <I>theoretical</I> value. Among these results, some simply represent the application of theoretical principles already known and stated by theory; others, by contrast, can represent theoretical elements - some new theoretical effects or even principles - that do not figure in the actual state of theory. Under the conditions just mentioned, it is in this way that the political practice of revolutionary Marxist parties can contain, <I>in the practical state</I>, theoretical elements, effects, or principles <I>in advance</I> of existing theory. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This is why, to the question: where do we find the principles of Marxism?, we can answer: <I>at once</I> in the  theoretical</I> works or the classics of Marxism, and in the <I>practical</I> works of the Communist Parties. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Let us clarify what is meant by the 'practical works' or political practice of Communist Parties. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   These can be <I>political</I> analyses of the concrete situation, <I>resolutions</I> fixing the party line, political discourses defining it and commenting on it, <I>programmatic slogans</I> recording political decisions or drawing out their conclusions. These can be <I>actions</I> undertaken, the <I>way</I> they are conducted as well as the results obtained. These can be <I>forms of organization</I> of the class struggle, the distinction between its different levels and between the corresponding different organizations. These can be <I>methods of leadership</I> of the class struggle and of the union with the masses, the <I>way</I> problems of the union of theory and practice in the

<A NAME="fnp63">
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>
<FONT SIZE=-1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
13.&nbsp;Take, for example, the political practice of the parties of the Second International at the beginning of the twentieth century: its mechanistic, economistic and evolutionist relationship to Marxist theory was essentially <I>false.</I> Hence one will not find in it positive <I>theoretical effects</I> in the 'practical state' but negative, regressive effects whose theoretical examination would be valuable, as long as it is conceived as the examination of a form of historical <I>pathology.</I>
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 64</B></FONT><P>

Party, between the leadership and the base, between the Party and the masses, etc., are resolved. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  These are so many <I>forms</I> of the political practice of the Communist Parties. It is these forms that may contain, in the practical state, new theoretical elements or effects, which can 'realize' and thus produce <I>principles</I> as yet absent from theory itself. These new theoretical elements must be sought not only in analyses, decisions, political discourses or actions undertaken, but also in the forms of organization, and in the methods of leadership of the class struggle. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Let us take an example. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  It is normal to look for the development of the theoretical principles of Marxism in the <I>theoretical</I> works of Lenin. Everyone knows what Lenin contributed to the working-class movement with his theory of imperialism. Yet he contributed still more. And if we wish to identify the most important <I>theoretical</I> events produced since Marx and Engels, we must look not so much in Lenin's <I>theoretical</I> texts as in his political texts. Lenin's deepest and most fertile theoretical discoveries are contained, above all, in his <I>political</I> texts, in what constitutes, then, the 'r&eacute;sum&eacute;' of his <I>political practice.</I> To take only <I>one</I> example, Lenin's political texts (analyses of the situation and its variations, decisions taken and analyses of their effects, etc.) give us, with dazzling insistence, <I>in the practical state</I>, a <I>theoretical</I> concept of capital importance: the concept of the 'present moment' or 'conjuncture'. This concept (or principle), produced by Lenin in the activity of a Marxist party, in order to lead its struggle, is an absolutely fundamental Marxist principle, not only for historical materialism but also - as will be shown below - for dialectical materialism; yet it did not explicitly figure in existing Marxist theory. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Only a little attention is needed to grasp the decisive import of this new theoretical concept. Not only does it retrospectively cast light on the distinctiveness of the Marxist theory of history, on the forms of <I>variation in dominance</I> within the social structure on the basis of determination in the last instance by the economic, and thus on historical periodization (that 'cross' of the historians); not only does it for the first time permit the enunciation of a theory - that is, a genuine conceptualization - of the possibility of political action, detached at last from the false antinomies of 'freedom' and 'necessity' (the 'play' of the variations in dominance in the conjuncture), and of the real conditions of political practice, in designating its object (the balance of class forces engaged in the struggle of the 'present moment'); not only does it allow us to think the articulation of the different instances whose combination of overdetermined effects can be <I>read</I> in the conjuncture - but it also allows us to pose, in a concrete manner, the problem of the union of theory and

<P ALIGN=right>&nbsp;<BR><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 65</B></FONT><P>

practice - that is, one of the most profound questions of dialectical materialism, not only in the domain of political practice but also in the domain of theoretical practice (for, in its relation with the non-theoretical, and especially the political, conjuncture, the theoretical conjuncture defines the link that allows us to think, in the necessity of its 'play', the nature of theoretical practice). 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  That a principle of such theoretical fecundity and importance was contained in the practical state in Lenin's political analyses and interventions from 1917 to 1923 is an incontestable fact. That this principle remained in a practical state, no one being sufficiently advised to 'derive' it from Lenin's political works, is, unfortunately, also a fact. A theoretical treasure was there, within reach, in Lenin's political works; no one 'discovered' it, and it remained sterile. Even the officially proclaimed primacy of practice, and of political practice, did not inspire systematic research on Lenin's political works. There have certainly been important lessons drawn from them in the practice of the Communist Parties. But, leaving aside Stalin's <I>Questions of Leninism</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp65">*</A>]</FONT> no systematic theoretical work was derived, bearing on Lenin's political principles. Moreover, there has been no systematic theoretical work drawn from Lenin's political practice, bearing on the theoretical concepts of historical materialism and dialectical materialism and thus on the important theoretical, even philosophical, discoveries produced by Lenin's <I>political practice.</I> In the same way, a number of theoretical concepts remained in the 'practical state' in the works of Marx himself. To what do we owe this regrettable situation, whose effects can be painfully felt today? Without a doubt, to the urgency of the political tasks of the working-class movement, which was not allowed the leisure of calm study by its class enemy. But also to the conception of Marxism constructed by 'intellectuals of the working class', cut off as they were either from its real practice or from the practice that produced its theory, and thus subject, despite their political loyalty, to bourgeois ideologies - empiricism, evolutionism, humanism, pragmatism - which they projected on to the great classical texts, as they did on to the great deeds of the working-class movement. Be that as it may, this situation lays a precise task before us: to draw from Marx, from Lenin, and from the great Communist leaders, not only what they said in their theoretical works, but also whatever these works contain in the practical state, as well as whatever their political works contain by way of theoretical discoveries. An urgent task. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  Thus, important theoretical events do not always or exclusively occur in theory: it happens that they also occur in <I>politics</I>, and that as a result, in certain of its sectors, political practice finds itself in advance of theory. It happens that theory does not take notice of these theoretical

events, which occur outside its official, recognized field, even though they are decisive, in many respects, for its own development.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp66">14</A>]</FONT> 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   If, to reprise an excellent formula (applied to Galileo by Georges Canguilhem), we declare that the peculiarity of theory is to '<I>speak the truth </I>' [<I>dire le vrai </I>], in the strong sense of the word - to isolate, define, state and demonstrate it with theoretical arguments; thus in a <I>discourse</I> subject, as Marx wished, to a rigorous 'order of exposition' - we must note, at the same time, that one can '<I>be in the truth </I>' [<I>&ecirc;tre dans le vrai </I>], without therewith being able to 'speak the truth'.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="PSPS90i.html#fnp66">15</A>]</FONT> This distinction may be understood in a very broad sense: one 'is in the truth' not only when one 'tells' it but also when one produces a theoretical content 'in the practical state', without at the same time producing its theoretical form, the form of its 'telling', or of its theoretical discourse. We have seen that one can thus be in the truth <I>in theory</I> itself, without in the same breath being able to <I>speak</I> the truth therein. It is thus that Marxist philosophy is found in the practical state in <I>Capital: Capital</I> is indeed in Marxist philosophy, without also being able to 'speak' it, without producing its rigorous discourse. We have just seen that one could thus 'be in the truth' in political practice, without being able to 'speak' this truth there, in the strong sense of theoretical discourse. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This possibility of being in the truth without saying the truth, the distinction between a theoretical content in the practical state and a theoretical content in the theoretical state - all these propositions are not conveniences or devices of an expository <I>rhetoric </I>; they are propositions that directly concern Marxism itself, because they involve the relation of theory and practice, they affirm the 'primacy of practice' - in theory as well as in practice - and, most crucially, they also show us the variations of this relation, which can oscillate between the extremes of a false relation and a correct relation. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Just because a new theoretical content can exist in the practical state in Marxist theory or in the practice of Communist Parties, it does not follow that everything existing there in a 'practical state' has a theoretical value. It is not true that one is in the truth solely by virtue of the fact that one is in 'practice', just as it is not true that one is in the truth solely by virtue of the fact that one decides to 'speak' it - that is, solely by virtue of the fact that one has a discourse with a 'theoretical' appearance, or

14.&nbsp;To take another example, it is clear that Marxist theory has still not drawn all that it should from the theory-practice and leadership-masses dialectic contained in Lenin's decision to adopt the slogan of 'Soviets', or his analysis of the transition phases of the revolutionary period.<BR>

that one 'does' theory. If this were true, all chatterboxes would be scientists, as Feuerbach said. One can 'do' bad practice, just as one can 'do' bad theory. In the practical as in the theoretical order, we have a renowned example, to which Lenin drew our attention: the theoretical and political revisionism of the Second International. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
  But this example leaves us with a final theoretical problem: in the theoretical practice of Marxism, as in its political practice, what conditions must be observed to assure a <I>correct union</I> of theory and practice - that is, to assure this union against the deviations to which it is exposed? The answer to this question depends on a <I>general</I> theory of the union of theory and practice, both in the field of theoretical practice and in the field of political practice, and on a theory of the <I>articulation</I> of these two fields; this theory can be <I>general</I> only on condition that it includes the theory of the extreme limits of the variability of this union (false union, correct union). We are no longer bereft of the means with which to pose and resolve this difficult and urgent problem: we have at our disposal the entire experience of the ideological struggle (Engels's and Lenin's struggle against theoretical dogmatism and revisionism) and of the political struggle (against political dogmatism and revisionism) of the Communist Parties. There, again, we have at our disposal an experience that undoubtedly contains, in the practical state, historical protocols of the greatest theoretical import. We need only go to work.

  In this work, the resources far outweigh the difficulties.
