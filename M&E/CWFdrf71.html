</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Four months after the commencement of the war, when the Government of Defence had thrown a sop to [the] Paris National Guard by allowing them to show their fighting capabilities at Buzenvall,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en112">112</A>]</FONT> the Government considered the opportune moment come to prepare Paris for capitulation. To the assembly of the <I>maires</I> of Paris for capitulation, Trochu in presence of and supported by Jules Favre and some others of his colleagues, revealed at last <I>his " plan. </I>" He said literally: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The first question, addressed to me by my colleagues <I>on the evening of the 4th September</I>, was this: Paris, can it stand, with any chance of success, a siege against the Prussian army? <I>I did not hesitate to answer in the negative.</I> Some of my colleagues here present will warrant the truth of these my words, and <I>the persistence of my opinion</I>, I told them in these very terms that, under the existing state of things, the attempt of Paris to maintain a siege against the Prussian army would be <I>a folly.</I> Without doubt, I added, this might be <I>a heroical folly</I>, but it would be nothing else. . . . <I>The events have not given the lie to my prevision. </I>" 
</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 112</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Trochu's plan, from the very day of the proclamation of the Republic, was <I>the capitulation of Paris and of France.</I> In point of fact he was the commander-in-chief of the Prussians. In a letter to Gambetta, Jules Favre himself confessed so much that the enemy to be put down, was not the Prussian soldier, but the Paris (revolutionary) "demagogue." The high-sounding promises to the people by the Government of Defence were therefore as many deliberate lies. The "plan" they systematically carried out by entrusting the defence of Paris to Bonapartist generals, by disorganizing the National Guard and by organizing famine under<A NAME="p112"> the maladministration of Jules Ferry. The attempts of the Paris workmen on the 5th of October, the 31st of October, etc., to supplant these traitors by the Commune, were put down as conspiracies with the Prussian!<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en113">113</A>]</FONT> After the capitulation the mask was thrown off (cast aside). The <I>capitulards</I> became a government by the grace of Bismarck. Being his prisoners, they stipulated with him a general armistice, the conditions of which disarmed France and rendered all further resistance impossible. Resuscitated at Bordeaux as the Government of the Republic, these very same <I>capitulards</I> through Thiers, their ex-Ambassador, and Jules Favre, their Foreign Minister, fervently implored Bismarck in the name of the majority of the so-called National Assembly, and long before the rise of Paris, to disarm, and occupy Paris, and put down "its <I>canaille</I>," as Bismarck himself on his return from France to <I>Berlin</I> sneeringly told his admirers at Frankfurt. This occupation of Paris by the Prussians -- such was the last word of the "plan" of the Government of Defence. The cynical effrontery with which, since their instalment at Versailles, the same men fawn upon and appeal to the armed intervention of Prussia, has dumbfounded even the venal press of Europe. The heroic exploits of the Paris National Guard, since they fight no longer 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 113</B></FONT><P>

<I>under</I> but <I>against</I> the <I>capitulards</I>, has forced even the most sceptical to brand the word "traitor" on the brazen fronts of the Trochu, Jules Favre <I>et</I> Co. The documents seized by the Commune, have, at last, furnished the juridical proofs of their high treason. Amongst these papers there are letters of the Bonapartist <I>sabreurs</I>, to whom the execution of Trochu's "plan" had been confided, in which these infamous wretches crack jokes at and make fun of their own "defence of Paris" (cf., for instance, the letter of <I>Alphonse Simon Guiod</I>, supreme commander of the artillery of the army of defence of Paris and Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, to <I>Suzanne</I>, General of division of artillery, published by the <I>Journal officiel</I> of the Commune). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is, therefore evident, that the men who now form the government of Versailles, can only be saved from the fate of convicted traitors by civil war, the death of the Republic and a monarchical <I>restauration</I> [restoration] under the shelter of Prussian bayonets. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But -- and this is most characteristic of the men of the Empire, as well as of the men who but on its soil and within its atmosphere could grow into mock-tribunes of the people -- the victorious Republic would not only brand them as traitors, it would have to surrender them as common felons to the criminal court. Look only at <I>Jules Favre</I>, <I>Ernest Picard</I>, and <I>Jules Ferry</I>, the great men, under Thiers, of the Government of Defence! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A series of authenticated judiciary documents spreading over about 20 years, and published by M. Milli&egrave;re, a representative to the National Assembly, proves that <I>Jules Favre</I>, living in adulterous concubinage with the wife of a drunkard resident at Algiers, had, by a most complicated concatenation of daring forgeries, contrived to grasp in the name of his 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 114</B></FONT><P>

bastards, a large succession that made him a rich man and that the connivance only of the Bonapartist tribunals saved him from exposure in a law-suit undertaken by the legitimate claimants. Jules Favre, then, this unctuous mouthpiece of family, religion, property, and order, has long since been forfeited to the <I>Code p&eacute;nal.</I> Lifelong penal servitude would be his unavoidable lot under every honest government. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <I>Ernest Picard</I>, the present Versailles Home Minister, appointed by himself on the 4th of September, Home Minister of the Government of Defence,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp114">*</A>]</FONT> after he had tried in vain to be appointed by Louis Bonaparte, this Ernest Picard is the brother of one <I>Arthur Picard.</I> When, together with Jules Favre and Co., he had the impudence to propose this worthy brother of his as a candidate in the Seine-et-Oise for the <I>Corps l&eacute;gislatif</I>, the imperialist government published two documents, a report of the Prefecture of Police (13 July,<FONT SIZE=-2>[**]</FONT> 1867) stating that this Arthur Picard was excluded from the <I>Bourse</I> as an "<I>escroc </I>" [swindler], and another document of the <I>11 December 1868</I>, according to which Arthur had confessed the theft of 300,000 frs., committed by him as a director of one of the branches of the <I>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</I>, Rue Palestro, No. 5. Ernest made not only his worthy Arthur the <I>editor-in-chief</I> of a paper of his own, the <I>Electeur libre</I>, founded under the Empire and continued to this day, a paper, in which the Republicans are daily denounced as "robbers, bandits, and <I>partageux</I> [appropriators]," but once become the Home Minister of the "De-

* In his final manuscript, Marx made a revision: Ernest Picard was Minister of Finance of the Government of National Defence and the <I>Electeur libre</I> was the paper of the Finance Office (see p. 45).<BR>

fence," Ernest employed Arthur as his financial medium between the Home Office to [<I>read</I> and] the Stock Exchange, there to discount the State secrets entrusted to him. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The whole "financial" correspondence between Ernest and Arthur has fallen into the hands of the Commune. Like the lachrymose Jules Favre, Ernest Picard, the Joe Miller of the Versailles Government, is a man forfeited to the <I>Code p&eacute;nal</I> and the galleys. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To make up this trio, <I>Jules Ferry</I>, a poor breadless barrister before 4 September, not content to organize the famine of Paris, had contrived to job a fortune out of this famine. The day on which he would have to give an account of his peculations during the Paris siege would be his day of judgment! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No wonder then that these men who can only hope to escape from the hulks in a monarchy, protected by Prussian bayonets, who but in the turmoil of civil war can win their <I>ticket of leave</I>, that these desperadoes were at once <I>chosen</I> by Thiers and accepted by the Rurals as the safest tools of the counter-revolution! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   No wonder that when in the beginning of April captured National Guards were exposed at Versailles to the ferocious outrages of Pi&eacute;tri's "lambs" and the Versailles mob, M. Ernest Picard, "with his hands in his trousers pockets, walked from group to group cracking jokes," while "on the balcony of the Prefecture Madame Thiers, Madame Jules Favre and a bevy of similar <I>dames</I>, looking in excellent health and spirits," exulted in that disgusting scene. No wonder then, that while one part of France winces under the heels of the conquerors, while Paris, the heart and head of France, daily sheds streams of its best blood in self-defence against the home traitors . . . , the Thiers, Favres <I>et</I> Co. indulge in revelries at the Palace of Louis XIV, such, for instance, as the grand <I>f&ecirc;te</I> given by Thiers 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 116</B></FONT><P>

in honour of Jules Favre on his return from Rouen (whither he had been sent to conspire with (fawn upon) the Prussians). It is the cynical orgy of evaded felons.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  If the Government of Defence first made Thiers their Foreign Ambassador, going a-begging at all courts of Europe, there to barter a king for France for their intervention against Prussia, if, later on, they sent him on a travelling tour through out the French provinces, there to conspire with the <I>Ch&acirc;teaux</I> and secretly prepare the general elections which, together with the capitulation, would take France by surprise -- Thiers, on his side, made them his ministers and high functionaries. They were safe men. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is one thing rather mysterious in the proceedings of Thiers, his recklessness in precipitating the revolution of Paris. Not content to goad Paris by the anti-Republican demonstrations of his Rurals, by the threats to <I>decapitate</I> and <I>decapitalize</I> Paris, by Dufaure's (Thiers' Minister of Justice) law of the 10th of March on the <I>&eacute;ch&eacute;ances</I> of bills [bills falling due] which impended bankruptcy on the Paris commerce, by appointing Orleanist ambassadors, by the transfer of the <I>Assembl&eacute;e</I> to Versailles, by an imposition of a new tax<A NAME="p116"> on newspapers, by the confiscation of the Republican Paris journals, by the revival of the state of siege, first proclaimed by Palikao<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en61">61</A>]</FONT> and annulled with the downfall of the imperialist government on the 4th of September, by appointing Vinoy, the <I>D&eacute;cembriseur</I> and ex-senator, Governor of Paris, <I>Valentin</I>, the imperialist gendarme, Prefect of Police, and Aurelle de Paladines, the Jesuit general, commander-in-chief of the Paris National Guard -- he opened the civil war with feeble forces, by Vinoy's attack on the buttes Montmartre, by the attempt first to rob the National Guards of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 117</B></FONT><P>

cannon which belonged to them and which were only left to them by the Paris convention, because they were their property, and thus to disarm Paris. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Whence this feverish eagerness <I>d'en finir</I> [to finish it off]? To disarm and put down Paris was of course the first condition of a monarchical counter-revolution, but an astute intriguer like Thiers could only risk the future of the difficult enterprise in undertaking it without due preparation, with ridiculously insufficient means, except under the sway of some overwhelmingly urgent wave. The motive was this. By the agency of Pouyer-Quertier, his Finance Minister, Thiers had concluded a loan of two milliards to be paid immediately down, and some more milliards to follow at certain terms. In this loan transaction a truly royal <I>pot de vin</I> (drink money) was reserved for those grand citizens -- Thiers, Jules Favre, Ernest Picard, Jules Simon, Pouyer-Quertier, etc. But there was one hitch in the transaction. Before definitively sealing the treaty, the contractors wanted one guarantee -- the <I>tranquillization of Paris.</I> Hence the reckless proceedings of Thiers. Hence the savage hatred against the Paris workmen, perverse enough to interfere with this fine job. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As to the Jules Favres, Picards, etc., we have said enough to prove them the worthy accomplices of such a jobbery. As to Thiers himself, it is notorious that during his two ministries under Louis Philippe he realized 2 millions, and that during his premiership (dating March 1840) he was taunted from the tribune of the Chamber of Deputies with his <I>Bourse</I> peculations, in answer to which he shed tears, a commodity he disposes of as free]y as Jules Favre and the celebrated comedian Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick Lema&icirc;tre. It is no less notorious that the first measure taken by M. Thiers to save France from the financial ruin, fastened upon her by the war, was -- to endow himself with a yearly 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 118</B></FONT><P>

His first step, as M. Thiers' Finance Minister, was to denounce that "hateful" treaty and to pronounce the necessity of re-establishing the old protective duties for his own shop. His second step was the patriotic attempt to strike Alsace by the re-established old protective duties on the pretext that in this case no international treaty stood in the way of their re-introduction. By this master-stroke his own shop at Rouen would have got rid of the dangerous competition of the rival shops at M&uuml;lhausen. His last step was to make a present to his son-in-law, M. Roche-Lambert, of the <I>receveur</I>-generalship [general tax-collector's office] of the Loiret, one of the rich booties falling into the lap of the <I>governing</I> bourgeois, and which Pouyer-Quertier had found so much fault with his imperialist predecessor, M. Magne, endowing his own son with that big jobbing place. This Pouyer-Quertier was then exactly the man for the perpetration of the above said job.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  Dufaure wants to put down Paris by press prosecutions in the provinces. Monstrous to bring journals before a jury because preaching "<I>conciliation. </I>" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Dufaure plays a great part in the Thiers intrigue. By his law of the 10th of March, he roused all the indebted commerce of Paris. By his law on Paris house rents, he menanced all Paris. Both laws were to punish Paris for having saved the honour of France and delayed the surrender to Bismarck for 6 months. Dufaure is an Orleanist, and a "Liberal," in the parliamentary sense of the word. Consequently, he has always been the minister of repression and of the state of siege. 
<A NAME="p120">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He accepted his first <I>portefeuille</I> on the 13 May, 1839, after the defeat of the <I>d&egrave;rni&egrave;re prise d'armes</I> [latest armed uprising] <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en117">117</A>]</FONT> Of the Republican party, was therefore the minister of the pitiless repression of the July government of that day.

   On the 2nd June 1849,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en118">118</A>]</FONT> Cavaignac, forced on the October (1848) to raise the state of siege, called into his ministry two<A NAME="p120b"> ministers of Louis Philippe (<I>Dufaure</I>, for the Interior, and <I>Vivien </I>). He appointed them on the demand of the <I>Rue</I> [de] <I>Poitiers </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en119">119</A>]</FONT> (Thiers), which demanded guarantees. He thus hoped to secure the support of the dynastics for the impending election of president. Dufaure employed the most illegal means to secure Cavaignac's candidature. Intimidation and electoral corruption had never been exercised on a larger scale. Dufaure inundated France with defamatory prints against the other candidates, and especially of Louis Bonaparte, what [<I>read</I>which] did not prevent him to become later on Louis Bonaparte's minister. Dufaure became again the minister of <I>the state of siege of 13 June 1849</I> (against the demonstration of the National Guard against the bombardment of Rome, etc., by the French army). He is now again the minister of the state of

siege, proclaimed at Versailles (for department of Seine-et-Oise). Power given to Thiers to declare any department whatever in a state of siege. Dufaure, as in 1839, as in 1849, wants new repressive laws, new press laws, a law to "abridge the formalities of the courts-martial." In a circular to the <I>Procureurs g&eacute;n&eacute;raux</I> [Attorney-Generals] he denounces the cry of "<I>conciliation </I>" as a press crime to be severely prosecuted. It is characteristic of the French magistrature that only one single <I>Procureur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</I> (that of Mayenne)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp121">*</A>]</FONT> wrote to Dufaure to

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   With respect to the law of 10 March and the law of house rents, it ought to be remarked that both Dufaure's and Picard's (both advocates) best clients are amongst the house proprietors and the <I>big bourses</I> averse to losing anything by the siege of Paris.

Rouge, 4 o'clock, 18th), General Lecomte and Cl&eacute;ment Thomas were taken prisoner and shot by the same excited soldiers of the 81st of the line. It was a summary act of Lynch justice performed despite the instances of some delegates of the <I>Central Committee.</I> Lecomte, an epauletted cut-throat, had four times commanded his troops, on the Place Pigalles, to charge an unarmed gathering of women and children. Instead of shooting the people, the soldiers shot him. Cl&eacute;ment Thomas, an ex-quartermaster, a "general," extemporized [on] the eve of the June massacres (1848) by the men of the <I>National</I>, whose <I>g&eacute;rant</I> [manager] he had been, had never dipped his sword in the blood of any other enemy but that of the Paris working class. He was one of the sinister plotters who deliberately provoked the June insurrection and one of its most atrocious executioners. When, on the 31st October, 1870, the Paris proletarian National Guards surprised the "Government of Defence" at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville and took them prisoner, these men who had [been] appointed by themselves, these <I>gens de paroles</I> [<I>men of their word </I>], as one of them, Picard, called them recently, gave their <I>word of honour</I> that they would make place to [<I>read</I> for] the <I>Commune.</I> Thus allowed to escape scot-free, they launched Trochu's Bretons on their too-confident captors. One of them, however, <I>M. Tamisier</I>, resigned his dignity as commander-in-chief of the National Guard. He refused to <I>break</I> his word of honour. Then the hour had again struck for Cl&eacute;ment Thomas. He was appointed, in Tamisier's place, commander-in-chief of the National Guard. He was the true man for Trochu's "plan." "He never made war upon the Prussians," he made war upon the National Guard, whom he disorganized, disunited, calumniated, weeding out all its officers hostile to Trochu's "plan," setting one set of National Guards against the other and whom he sacrificed in "sorties," so planned as to cover them with

ridicule. Haunted by the spectres of his June victims, this man, without any official charge, must needs again reappear on [the] theatre of war of the 18th of March, where he scented another massacre of the Paris people. He fell a victim of Lynch justice in the first moment of popular exasperation. The men who had surrendered Paris to the tender mercies of the <I>D&eacute;cembriseur</I> Vinoy, in order to kill the Republic and pocket the <I>pots de vin</I>, [tips], stipulated by the Pouyer-Quertier contract, shouted now: Assassins, Assassins! Their howl was re-echoed by the press of Europe so eager for the blood of the "proletarians." A farce of hysterical "sensibleness" was enacted in the rural <I>Assembl&eacute;e</I>, and now as before, the corpses of their friends were most welcome weapons against their enemies. Paris and the Central Committee were made responsible for an accident out of their control. It is known, how in the days of June 1848, the "men of Order" shook Europe with the cry of indignation against the insurgents because of the assassination of the Archbishop of Paris.<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> Even at that time they knew perfectly well from the evidence of M.

The Versailles Government had hardly realized a first military success, when Captain Desmar&ecirc;t, who at the head of his gendarmes assassinated the chivalrous Flourens, has been decorated by Thiers. Flourens had saved the lives of the "defence men" on the 31st October. Vinoy the runaway (runagate), was appointed Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, because he had our brave comrade Duval when taken prisoner, shot inside the redoubts,<A NAME="p124"> because as a second instalment, he had shot some dozen captive troops of the line who had joined the Paris people, and inaugurated this civil war by the "methods of December."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en122">122</A>]</FONT> General Galliffet -- "the husband of that charming Marchioness whose costumes at the masked balls were one of the wonders of the Empire," as a London penny-a-liner delicately puts it, -- "surprised" near Rueil a captain, lieutenant, and private of National Guards, had them at once shot, and immediately published a proclamation to glorify himself on the deed.

                                    The Assembly and the Paris Revolution
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The Assembly, summoned at the dictate of the foreign invader, was, as is clearly laid down in the Versailles convention of the 29th January, but elected for one single purpose: To decide the continuation of war or settle the conditions of peace. In their calling the French people to electoral urns, the <I>capitulards</I> of Paris themselves plainly defined that specific mission of the Assembly and this accounts to a great part for its very constitution. The continuation of the war having become impossible through the very terms of the armistice humbly accepted by the <I>capitulards</I>, the Assembly had in fact but to register a disgraceful peace and for this specific performance the worst men of France were [the] best. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Republic was proclaimed on the 4th of September, not by the pettifoggers who installed themselves at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville as a Government of Defence, but by the Paris people. It was acclaimed throughout France without a single dissentient voice. It conquered its own existence by a five months' war whose cornerstone was the prolonged resistance of Paris. Without this war, carried on by the Republic and in the name of the Republic, the Empire would have been restored by Bismarck after the capitulation of Sedan, the pettifoggers with M. Thiers at their head would have had to capitulate not for Paris, but for personal guarantees against a voyage to Cayenne, and the Rural Assembly would never have been heard of. It met only by the grace of the Republican revolution, inchoated at Paris. Being no constituent Assembly, as M. Thiers himself has re- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 130</B></FONT><P>

peated to nauseousness, it would, if not as a mere chronicler of the passed incidents of the Republican Revolution, not even have had the right to proclaim the <I>destitution</I> [removal] of the Bonaparte's dynasty. The only legitimate power, therefore, in France is the <I>Revolution</I> itself, centring in Paris. That Revolution was not made against Napoleon the Little, but against the social and political conditions, which engendered the Second Empire, which received their last finish under its sway, and which, as the war with Prussia glaringly revealed, would leave France a cadaver, if they were not superseded by the regenerating powers of the French working-class Revolution. The attempts of the Rural Assembly holding only an attorney's power to the Revolution to sign the disastrous bond<A NAME="p130"> handed over by its present "Executive" to the foreign invader, its attempt to treat the Revolution as its own <I>capitulard</I> is, therefore, a monstrous usurpation. Its war against Paris is nothing but a cowardly Chouannerie<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en129">129</A>]</FONT> under the shelter of Prussian bayonets. It is a bare conspiracy to assassinate France, in order to save the privileges, the monopolies and the luxuries of the degenerate, effete, and putrefied classes that have dragged her to the abyss from which she can only be saved by the herculean hand of a truly Social Revolution.

  Even before he became a "statesman," M. Thiers had proved his lying powers as a historian. But the vanity, so characteristic of dwarfish men, has this time betrayed him into the sublime of the ridiculous. His army of Order, the dregs of the Bonapartist<A NAME="p130a"> <I>soldatesca</I> [soldiery] freshly reimported, by the grace of Bismarck, from Prussian prisons, the Pontifical Zouaves,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en92">92</A>]</FONT> the Chouans<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en91">91</A>]</FONT> of Charette, the Vend&eacute;ens of Cathelineau, the "municipals"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en130">130</A>]</FONT> of Valentin, the <I>ex-sergents de ville</I> of Pi&eacute;tri

and the Corsican gendarmes of Valentin, who under L. Bonaparte were only the spies of the army but under M. Thiers form its warlike flower, the whole under the supervision of epauletted <I>mouchards</I> and under the command of the runaway Decembrist marshals who had no honour to lose -- this motley, ungainly, hangdog lot M. Thiers dubs "<I>the finest army France ever possessed </I>"! If he allows the Prussians still to quarter at St. Denis, it is only to frighten them by the sight of the "finest army" of Versailles.

    Small state rogueries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Everlasting suggester of parliamentary intrigues M. Thiers was never anything else but an "able" journalist and a clever word-"fencer," a master of parliamentary roguery, a virtuoso in perjury, a craftsman in all the small stratagems, base perfidies, and subtle devices of parliamentary party-warfare. This mischievous gnome charmed the French bourgeoisie during half a century because he is the truest intellectual expression of their own class corruption. When in the ranks of the opposition, he over and over rehearsed his stale homily of the "libert&eacute;s n&eacute;cessaires,"<A NAME="p131"> to stamp them out when in power. When out of office, he used to threaten Europe with the sword of France. And what were his diplomatic performances in reality? To pocket in 1841 the humiliation of the London treaty,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en131">131</A>]</FONT> to hurry on the war with Prussia by his declamations against German unity, to compromise France in 1870 by his begging tour at all the courts of Europe, to sign in 1871 the Paris capitulation to accept a "peace at any price" and implore from Prussia a concession -- leave and means to get up a civil war in his own downtrodden country. To a man of his stamp the underground agencies of modern society remained of course always un- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 132</B></FONT><P>

known; but even the palpable changes at its surface he failed to understand. For instance, any deviation from the old French protective system he denounced as a sacrilege and, as a minister of Louis Philippe, went the length of treating disdainfully the construction of railways as a foolish chimera and even under Louis Bonaparte he eagerly opposed every reform of the rotten French army organization. A man without ideas, without convictions, and without courage. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    A professional "Revolutionist" in that sense, that in his eagerness of display, of wielding power and putting his hands into the National Exchequer, he never scrupled, when banished to the banks<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp132">*</A>]</FONT> of the opposition, to stir the popular passions and provoke a catastrophe to displace a rival; he is at the same time a most shallow man of routine, etc. The working class he reviled as "<I>the vile multitude. </I>" One of his former colleagues in the legislative assemblies, a contemporary of his, a capitalist and however a member of the Paris Commune, <I>M.

  Banded with the Republicans before the Revolution of July, he slipped into his first ministry under Louis Philippe by thrusting Laffitte, his old protector. His first deed was to throw his old collaborator Armand Carrel into prison. He insinuated himself with Louis Philippe as a spy upon, and the gaol-<I>accoucheur</I> of,<A NAME="p133a"> the Duchess of Berry, but his activity centred in the massacre of the insurgent Paris Republicans in the Rue Transnonain and the September Laws against the press,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en47">47</A>]</FONT> to be then cast aside as an instrument become blunted. Having intrigued himself again into power in 1840, he planned the Paris fortifications, opposed as an attempt on the liberty of Paris by the whole democratic party, except the bourgeois Republicans of the <I>National.</I> M. Thiers replied to their outcry from the tribune of the <I>Chambre des d&eacute;put&eacute;s </I>: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>

d'abord, c'est calomnier un gouvernement quel qu'il soit de supposer qu'll puisse un jour chercher &agrave; se maintenir en bombardant la capitale. Quoi? Apr&egrave;s avoir perce de ses bombes la voute des Invalides ou du Panth&eacute;on, apr&egrave;s avoir inond&eacute; de ses feux la demeure de vos familles, il se pr&eacute;senterait &agrave; vous pour vous demander la confirmation de son existence! <I>Mais il serait cent tois plus impossible apr&egrave;s la victoire qu'auparavant. </I>" [Chamber of Deputies: "What? To fancy that any works of fortification could ever endanger liberty. . . . That is to depart completely from reality. And first of all it is a slander on a <I>government whatever it might be like</I> to suppose that it could some day attempt to maintain itself by bombarding the capital. What? After having breached the vault of the H&ocirc;tel des Invalides or of the Panth&eacute;on with its shells, after having inundated your houses with its fire, it would present itself before you to demand confirmation of its existence! <I>But such a government would be a hundred times more impossible after the victory than before. </I>"]

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Indeed, neither the government of Louis Philippe nor that of the Bonapartist Regency dared to withdraw from Paris and bombard it. This employment of the fortifications was reserved to M. Thiers, their original plotter.

    When King Bomba<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en49">49</A>]</FONT> of Naples bombarded Palermo in January 1848, M. Thiers again declared in the Chamber of Deputies: 

   "Vous savez, Messieurs, ce qui se passe &agrave; Palerme: vous avez tous tressailli d'horreur en apprenant que, pendant 48 heures, une grande ville a &eacute;t&eacute; bombard&eacute;e. Par qui? Etait-ce par un ennemi &eacute;tranger, exer&ccedil;ant les droits de la guerre? Non, Messieurs, par <I>son propre gouvernement.</I> Et pourquoi? <I>Parce que cette ville infortun&eacute;e demandait des droits.</I> Eh bien! pour la demande de ses droits il y a eu 48 heures de bombardement.

C'est un service &agrave; rendre &agrave; l'humanit&egrave; que de venir, du haut de la plus grande tribune peut-&ecirc;tre de l'Europe, faire retentir <I>quelques paroles d'indignation contre de tels actes.</I> Messieurs, lorsque, il y a 50 ans, les Autrichiens, exer&ccedil;ant les droits de la guerre, pour s'&eacute;pargner les longueurs d'un si&egrave;ge, voulurent bombarder Lille, lorsque plus tard les Anglais, qui exer&ccedil;aient aussi les droits de la guerre, bombard&egrave;rent Copenhague, et tout r&eacute;cemment, <I>quand le r&eacute;gent Espartero</I>, qui avait rendu des services &agrave; son pays, <I>pour r&eacute;primet une insurrection</I>, <I>a voulu bombarder</I>

<I>Barcelone</I>, dans tous les partis, il y a eu une g&eacute;n&eacute;rale indignation." ["You know, gentlemen, what is happening at Palermo. You, all of you, shake with horror on hearing that a large town has been bombarded for 48 hours. By whom? Was it by a foreign enemy exercising the rights of war? No, gentlemen, it was by <I>its own Government.</I> And why? <I>Because that unfortunate town demanded its rights.</I> Well, then, for demanding its rights, it has got 48 hours of bombardment. Allow me to appeal to European public opinion. It is doing a service to mankind to stand up and make reverberate <I>some words of indignation against such acts</I> from perhaps the greatest tribune of Europe. Gentlemen, 50 years ago when the Austrians, exercising the rights of war, wanted to bombard Lille in order to spare it a long siege, when later the English, who also exercised the rights of war, bombarded Copenhagen, and recently, <I>when the Regent Espartero</I>, who had rendered services to his country, <I>wanted to bombard Barcelona in order to suppress an insurrection</I>, indignation was general in all political parties."] 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Little more than a year later, Thiers acted the most fiery apologist of the bombardment of Rome by the troops of the French Republic, and exalted his friend, General Changarnier, for sabring down the Paris National Guards protesting against this breach of the French Constitution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    A few days before the Revolution of February 1848, fretting at the long exile from place to which Guizot had condemned him, [and] scenting the growing commotion of the masses, which he hoped would enable him to oust his rival and impose himself upon Louis Philippe, <I>Thiers</I> exclaimed in the Chamber of Deputies: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>Je suis du parti de la r&eacute;volution</I>, tant en <I>France</I> qu'en <I>Europe.</I> Je souhaite que le gouvernement de la r&eacute;volution reste dans les mains des hommes mod&eacute;r&eacute;s. . . .

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  To put down the February Revolution was his exclusive occupation from the day when the Republic was proclaimed to the <I>coup d'&eacute;tat.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The first days after the February explosion he anxiously hid himself, but the Paris workmen despised him too much to hate him. Still, with his notorious cowardice, which made Armand Carrel answer to his boast "he would one day die on [the] banks of the Rhine": "Thou wilt die in a gutter" -- he dared not play a part on the public stage before the popular forces were broken down through the massacre of the insurgents of June. He confined himself first to the secret direction of the conspiracy of the <I>r&eacute;union</I> [party] of the Rue de Poitiers which resulted in the <I>Restauration</I> of the Empire, until the stage had become sufficiently clear to reappear publicly on it.

  During the siege of Paris, on the question whether Paris was about to capitulate, Jules Favre answered that, to utter the word capitulation, the bombardment of Paris was wanted! This explains his melodramatic protests against the Prussian bombardment, indicating the latter was a mock-bombardment, while the Thiers bombardment is a stern reality.

   He is for 40 years on the stage. He has never initiated a single useful measure in any department of state or life. Vain, sceptical, epicurean, he has never written or spoken for things. In his eyes the things themselves are mere pretexts for the display of his pen or his tongue. Except his thirst for place and pelf and display there is nothing real about him, not even his chauvinism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In the true vein of vulgar professional journalists he now sneers in his bulletins [at] the bad looks of his Versailles prisoners, now communicates that the Rurals are "&agrave; leur aise [at

   Paris -- the "Paris" of the mass of the Paris people fighting against him is not "Paris." "Paris -- that is the rich, the capitalist, the idle" (why not the cosmopolitan stew?). This is the Paris of M. Thiers. The real Paris, working, thinking, fighting Paris, the Paris of the people, the Paris of the Commune is a "vile multitude." There is the whole case of M. Thiers, not only for Paris, but for France. The Paris that showed its courage in the "pacific procession" and Saisset's escapade, that throngs now at Versailles, at Rueil, at St. Denis, at St. Germain-en-Laye, followed by the <I>cocottes</I> sticking to the "man of religion, family, order, and property" (the Paris of the really "dangerous," of the exploiting and lounging classes) ("the <I>franc-fileurs </I>"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en89">89</A>]</FONT>) and amusing itself by looking by the telescope at the battle going on, for whom "the civil war is but an agreeable diversion" -- that is the Paris of M. Thiers (as the emigration of Coblenz was the France of M. de Calonne). In his vulgar journalist vein he knows not even to observe sham dignity, but he murders the wives and girls and children, found under the ruins of Neuilly, not to swerve from the etiquette of "legitimacy." He must needs illuminate the municipal elections he has ordered in France by the conflagration of Clamart, burnt by petroleum bombs. The Roman historians finish off

Nero's character by telling us that the monster gloried in being a rhymester and a comedian. But lift a mere professional journalist and parliamentary mountebank like Thiers to power, and he will outnero Nero. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He acts only his part as the blind tool of class interests in allowing the Bonapartist "generals" to revenge themselves on Paris; but he acts his personal part in the little byplay of bulletins, speeches, addresses, in which the vanity, vulgarity, and lowest taste of the journalist creep out.

  He compares himself with Lincoln and the Parisians with the rebellious slaveholders of the South.

Paris was for all purposes of internal defence and [opposing] foreign aggression fully secured by its armed National Guard, but Thiers superadded at once [to] the capitulation of Paris to the foreigner, the character of the capitulation of Paris to himself and Co. This stipulation was a stipulation for civil war. That war itself he opens not only with the passive permission of Prussia, but by the facilities she lends him, by the captive French troops she magnanimously despatches him from German dungeons! In his bulletins, in his and Favre's speeches in the Assembly, he crawls in the dust before Prussia and threatens Paris every eight days with her intervention, after having failed to get it, as stated by Bismarck himself.

  After the break-down of Prussia (Tilsit peace 1807), its government felt that it could only save itself<A NAME="p140"> and the country by a great social regeneration (revolution).

Still there were great social changes, doing away with the worst privileges of the ruling classes and changing the economical basis of the old society. They felt that the great malady could only be cured by heroic measures. They felt that they could only answer to the victors by social reforms, by calling into life elements of popular regeneration. The French catastrophe of 1870 stands unparalleled in the history of the modern world! It showed official France, the France of Louis Bonaparte, the France of the ruling classes and their State parasites -- a putrescent cadaver. And what is the first attempt of the infamous men, who had got at her government by a surprise of the people and who continue to hold it by a conspiracy with the foreign invader, what is [their] first attempt?

to summon all the old Legitimist spectres, beaten by the July Revolution, the fossil swindlers of Louis Philippe, beaten by the Revolution of February, and celebrate an orgy of counter-revolution! Such heroism in exaggerated self-debasement is unheard of in the annals of history! But, what is most characteristic, instead of arousing a general shout of indignation on the part of official Europe and America, it evokes a current of sympathy and of fierce denunciation of Paris! This proves that Paris, true to its historical antecedents, seeks the regeneration of the French people in making it the champion of the regeneration of old society, making the social regeneration of mankind the national business of France! It is the emancipation of the producing class from the exploiting classes, their retainers and their State parasites, who prove the truth of the French adage, that "les valets du diable sont pires que le diable himself." ["the devil's valets are worse than the devil himself."] Paris has hissed<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> the flag of mankind!

  The different fractions of the French bourgeoisie had successively <I>their reigns</I>, the great landed proprietors under the <I>Restoration</I> (the old Bourbons), the capitalists under the parliamentary monarchy of July (Louis Philippe), while its Bonapartist and Republican elements kept rankling in the background. Their party feuds and intrigues were of course carried on on pretexts of <I>public welfare</I>, and a popular revolution having got rid of these monarchies, the other set in.

All this changed with the Republic (February). All the fractions of the bourgeoisie combined together in the <I>Party of Order</I>, that is the party of proprietors and capitalists, bound together to maintain the economic subjugation of labour and the repressive State machinery supporting it. Instead of a monarchy, whose very name signified the prevalence of one bourgeois fraction over the other, a victory on one side and a defeat on the other (the triumph of one side and the humiliation of the other), the <I>Republic</I> was the anonymous joint-stock company of the combined bourgeois fractions, of all the <I>exploiteurs</I> of the people clubbed together, and indeed, Legitimists, Bonapartists, Orleanists, bourgeois Republicans, Jesuits and Voltairiens, embraced each other -- no longer hidden by the shelter of the crown, no longer able to interest the people in their party feuds by masquerading them into [<I>read</I> as] struggles for popular interest, no longer subordinate the one to the other. Direct and confessed antagonism of their class rule to the emancipation of the producing masses -- <I>order</I>, the name for the economical and political conditions of their class rule and the servitude of labour, this anonymous or Republican form of the bourgeois <I>r&eacute;gime</I> -- this bourgeois Republic, this Republic of the <I>Party of Order</I> is the most <I>odious</I> of all political <I>r&eacute;gimes.</I> Its direct business, its only <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I> is to crush down the people. It is the <I>terrorism</I> of class rule. The thing is done in this way. The people having fought and made the Revolution, proclaimed the Republic, and made room for a National Assembly, the bourgeois, whose known Republican professions are a guarantee for their "Republic," are pushed on the foreground of the stage by the majority of the Assembly, composed of the vanquished and professed enemies of the Republic. The Republicans are entrusted with the task to goad the people into the trap of an insurrection, to be crushed by fire 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 143</B></FONT><P>

and sword. This part was performed by the party of the <I>National</I> with Cavaignac at their head after the Revolution of February (by the June Insurrection). By their crime against the masses, these Republicans lose then their sway. They have done their work and, if yet allowed to support the <I>Party of Order</I> in its general struggle against the proletariat, they are at the same time displaced from the government, forced to fall back in the last ranks, and only allowed "on sufferance." The combined Royalist bourgeois then become the father of the Republic, the true rule of the "Party of Order" sets in. The material forces of the people being broken for the time being, the work of reaction -- the breaking down of all the concessions conquered in four revolutions -- begins piece by piece. The people is stung to madness not only by the deeds of the <I>Party of Order</I>, but by the cynical effrontery with which it is treated as the vanquished, with which in its own name, in the name of the Republic, that low lot rules it supreme. Of course, that spasmodic form of <I>anonymous</I> class despotism cannot last long, can only be a transitory phasis. It knows that it is seated on a revolutionary volcano. On the other hand, if the Party of Order is united in its war against the working class, in its capacity of the <I>Party of Order</I>, the play of intrigue of its different fractions, the one against the other, each for the prevalence of its peculiar interest in the old order of society, each for the restoration of its own pretender and personal ambitions, sets in in full force as soon as its rule seems secured (guaranteed) by the destruction of the material revolutionary forces. This combination of a common war against the people and a common conspiracy against the Republic, combined with the internal feuds of its rulers, and their play of intrigues, paralyses society, disgusts and bewilders the masses of the middle class and "troubles" business, keeps them in a chronic state of disquie- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 144</B></FONT><P>

tude. All the conditions of despotism are created (have been engendered) under this <I>r&eacute;gime</I>, but despotism without quietude, despotism with parliamentary anarchy at its head. Then the hour has struck for a <I>coup d'&eacute;tat</I>, and the incapable lot has to make room for any lucky pretender, making [an] end of the <I>anonymous</I> form of class rule. In this way Louis Bonaparte made an end of the bourgeois Republic after its 4 years of existence. During all that time Thiers was the "&acirc;me damn&eacute;e" [tool] of the Party of Order, that in the name of the Republic made war upon the Republic, a class war upon the people, and, in reality, created the Empire. He played exactly the same part now as he played then, only then but as a parliamentary intriguer, now as the Chief of the Executive. Should he not be conquered by the Revolution, he will now as then be a baffled tool. Whatever counter-vailing government will set in, its first act will be to cast aside the man who surrendered France to Prussia and bombarded Paris. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thiers had many grievances against Louis Bonaparte. The latter had used him as a tool and a dupe. He had frightened him (shocked his nerves) by his arrest after the <I>coup d'&eacute;tat.</I> He had annulled him by putting down the parliamentary <I>r&eacute;gime</I>, the only one under which a mere State parasite, like Thiers, a mere talker, can play a political part. Last [but] not least Thiers, having been the historic shoeblack of Napoleon, had so long described his deeds, as to fancy he had enacted them himself. The legitimate caricature of Napoleon I was in his eyes not Napoleon the Little, but little Thiers. With all that there was no infamy committed by L. Bonaparte which had not been backed by Thiers, from the occupation of Rome by the French troops to the war with Prussia. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Only a man of his shallow head can fancy for one moment, that a Republic with his head on its shoulders, with a National

  There is nothing more grotesquely horrid than a Tom Pouce affecting to play the (acting the part [of]) Timur Tamerlane. With him the deeds of cruelty are not only a matter of business, but a thing of theatrical display (stage effect) of phantastical vanity. To write "his" bulletins, to show "his" severity, to have "his" troops, "his" strategy, "his" bombardments, "his" petroleum bombs, to hide "his" cowardice under the cold-bloodedness with which he allows the Decembrist blacklegs to take their revenge on Paris! This kind of heroism in exaggerated baseness! He exults in the important part he plays and the noise he makes in the world! He quite fancies to be a great man: and how gigantic (titanic) he, the dwarf, the parliamentary dribbler, must look in the eyes of the world! In [the] midst [of] the horrid scenes of this war, one cannot help smiling at the ridiculous capers Thiers Vanity cuts! M. Thiers is a man of lively imagination, there runs an artist's vein through his blood, and an artist's vanity able to gull him into a belief in his own lies, and a belief in his own grandeur.

It is evident that it is only the Versailles army, government and [the] Chinese wall of lies, that stand between Paris and the provinces. If that wall falls, they will unite with it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is most characteristic, that the same men (Thiers <I>et</I> Co.) who in May 1850 abolished by a parliamentary conspiracy (Bonaparte aided them, to get them into a snare, to have them at his mercy, and to proclaim himself after the <I>coup d'&eacute;tat</I> as the restorer of the universal suffrage against the Party of Order and its Assembly) <I>the universal suffrage</I>, because under the Republic it might still play them freaks, are now its fanatical adepts, make it their "legitimate" title against Paris, after it had received under<A NAME="p153"> Bonaparte such an organization as to be the mere plaything in the hand of the Executive, a mere machine of cheat, surprise, and forgery on the part of the Executive.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
  It may be asked how these superannuated parliamentary mountebanks and intriguers like Thiers, Favre, Dufaure, Garnier-Pag&egrave;s (only strengthened by a few rascals of the same stamp) continue to reappear, after every revolution, on the surface, and usurp the executive power -- these men that always exploit and betray the Revolution, shoot down the people that made it, and sequester the few liberal concessions 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 154</B></FONT><P>

conquered from former governments (which they opposed themselves)? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The thing is very simple. In the first instance, if very unpopular, like Thiers after the February Revolution, popular magnanimity spares them. After every successful rising of the people the cry of conciliation, raised by the implacable enemies of the people, is re-echoed by the people in the first moments of the enthusiasm at its own victory. After this first moment men like Thiers and Dufaure eclipse themselves as long as the people holds material power, and work in the dark. They reappear as soon as it is disarmed, and are acclaimed by the bourgeoisie as their <I>chefs-de-file</I> [file-leaders]. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Or, like Favre, Garnier-Pag&egrave;s, Jules Simon, etc. (recruited by a few younger ones of similar stamp) and Thiers himself after the 4th of September, [they] were the "respectable" Republican opposition under Louis Philippe; afterwards the parliamentary opposition under L. Bonaparte. The reactionary <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> they have themselves initiated when raised to power by the Revolution, secure for them the ranks of the opposition, deporting, killing, exiling the true revolutionists. The people forget their past, the middle class look upon them as their men, their infamous past is forgotten, and thus they reappear to recommence their treason and their work of infamy.

M. Thiers, says the <I>Times</I> correspondent, was weak when he ought to have been firm (the coward is always weak as long as <I>he has to apprehend danger for himself </I>), and firm when everything was to be gained by some concessions. (The rascal is always firm, when the employment of material force bleeds France, gives great airs to himself, but when he, personally, is safe. This is his whole cleverness. Like Anthony, Thiers is an "honest man.")

</FONT></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Nightwork of journeymen bakers suppressed</I> (<I>20 April </I>). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>The private jurisdiction</I>, usurped by the seigneurs of mills, etc. (manufacturers), (employers, great and small), being at the same time judges, executors, gainers and parties in the disputes, that right of <I>a penal code of their own</I>, enabling them to rob the labourers' wages by fines and deductions as punishment, etc., abolished in public and private work shops; penalties impended upon the employers in case they infringe upon this law; <I>fines and deductions</I> extorted since the 18th of March to be paid back to the workmen (<I>27 April </I>). Sale of pawned articles at pawnshops suspended (<I>29 March </I>). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A great lot of workshops and manufactories have been closed in Paris, their owners having run away. This is the old method of the industrial capitalists, who consider themselves entitled, "by the spontaneous action of the laws of political economy," not only to make a profit out of labour, as the condition of labour, but to stop it altogether and throw the workmen on the pavement -- to produce an artificial crisis whenever a victorious revolution threatens the "order" of their "system." The Commune, very wisely, has appointed a 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 157</B></FONT><P>

Communal commission which, in co-operation with delegates chosen by the different trades, will inquire into the ways of handing over the deserted workshops and manufactories to co-operative workmen societies with some indemnity for the capitalist deserters (<I>16 April </I>); (this commission has also to make statistics of the abandoned workshops). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Commune has given order to the <I>mairies</I> to make no distinction between the femmes called illegitimate, the mothers and widows of National Guards, as to the indemnity of 75 centimes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The public prostitutes till now kept for the "men of Order" at Paris, but for their "safety" kept in personal servitude under the arbitrary rule of the police; the Commune has liberated the prostitutes from this degrading slavery, but swept away the soil upon which, and the men by whom, prostitution flourishes. The higher prostitutes -- the <I>cocottes</I> -- were of course, under the rule of Order, not the slaves, but the masters of the police and the governors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There was, of course, no time to reorganize public instruction (education); but by removing the religious and clerical element from it, the Commune has taken the initiative in the mental emancipation of the people. It has appointed a commission for the organization <I>de l'enseignement</I> [of education] (primary (elementary) and professional) (<I>28 April </I>). It has ordered that all tools of instruction, like books, maps, paper, etc., be given gratuitously by the schoolmasters, who receive them in their turn from the respective <I>mairies</I> to which they belong. No schoolmaster is allowed on any pretext to ask payment from his pupils for these instruments of instruction (<I>28 April </I>). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Pawnshops </I>: toute reconnaissance du mont-de-pi&eacute;t&eacute; ant&eacute;rieure au 25 avril 1871, portant engagement d'effets d'habillement, de meubles, de linge, de livres, d'objets de literie

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   &eacute;ch&eacute;ances (Payment of bills of exchange due) (<I>expiration of bills </I>): all prosecutions for bills of exchange, fallen due, suspended (<I>12 April </I>). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   All commercial papers of that sort to be repaid in (repayments spread over) two years, to begin next July 15, the debt being not chargeable with interest. The total amount of the sums due divided in 8 <I>equal coupures</I> [<I>portions </I>] <I>payable by trimester</I> (first trimester to be dated from July 15). Only on these partial payments when fallen due judicial prosecutions permitted (<I>16 April </I>). The Dufaure laws on leases and bills of exchange entailed the bankruptcy of the majority of the respectable shopkeepers of Paris. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The notaries, <I>huissiers</I>, auctioneers, bumbailiffs and other judicial officers making till now a fortune of their functions, transformed into agents of the Commune receiving from it fixed salaries like other workmen.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  As the professors of the Ecole de m&eacute;decine have run away, the Commune appointed a commission for the foundation of <I>free universities</I> no longer State parasites; given to the students that had passed their examination, means to practise independent of Doctor titles (titles to be conferred by the faculty). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Since the judges of the <I>Civil Tribunal of the Seine</I>, like the other magistrates always ready to function under any class government, had run away, Commune appointed an advocate to do the most urgent business until the reorganization of tribunals on the basis of general suffrage (<I>26 April </I>).

  <I>Conscription abolished.</I> In the present war every able man (National Guard) must serve. This measure excellent to get rid of all traitors and cowards hiding in Paris. (<I>29 March </I>). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Games of hazard suppressed</I> (<I>2 April </I>). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Church separated from State; the religious budget suppressed; all clerical estates declared national properties (<I>3 April </I>). The Commune, having made inquiries consequent upon private information, found that beside the old guillotine the "<I>government of order </I>" had commanded the construction of a new guillotine (more expeditious and portable) and paid in advance. The Commune ordered both the old and the new guillotines to be burned publicly on the 6th of April. The Versailles journals, re-echoed by the press of Order all over the world, narrated the Paris people, as a demonstration against the bloodthirstiness of the Communards, had burnt these guillotines! (<I>6 April.</I>) All political prisoners were set free at once after the Revolution of the 18th of March. But the Commune knew that under the <I>r&eacute;gime of L. Bonaparte</I> and his worthy successor the Government of Defence, many people 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 160</B></FONT><P>

were simply incarcerated on no charge whatever as political suspects. Consequently it charged [one] of its members -- Protot -- to make inquiries. By him 150 people [were] set free who, being arrested since six months, had not yet under gone any judicial examination; many of them, already arrested under Bonaparte, had been for a year in prison without any charge or judicial examination (<I>9 April </I>). This fact, so characteristic of the Government of Defence, enraged them. They asserted the Commune had liberated all felons. But who liberated convicted felons? The forger Jules Favre. Hardly got into power, he hastened to liberate <I>Pic and Taillefer</I>, condemn ed for theft and forgery in the affair of the <I>Etendard.</I> One of these men, Taillefer, daring to return to Paris, has been reinstated in his convenient abode. But this is not all. The Versailles Government has delivered, in the <I>Maisons centrales</I> [prisons] all over France, convicted thiefs on the condition of entering M. Thiers' army.

   In regard to these decrees of reprisals to be remarked:

<I>the Paris clergy.</I> The Archbishop and the cure de [la] Madeleine have only written to Thiers because averse to "<I>the effusion of their own blood </I>," in their quality as hostages. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Secondly: After the publication by the Commune of the decree of reprisals, the taking of hostages, etc., the atrocious treatment of the Versailles prisoners by Pi&eacute;tri's lambs and Valentin's gendarmes did not cease, but the assassination of the captive Paris soldiers and National Guards was stopped to set in with renewed fury so soon as the Versailles Government had convinced itself that the Commune was too humane to execute its decree of the 6th of April. Then the assassination set in again wholesale. The Commune did not execute one hostage, not one prisoner, not even some gendarme officers who under the disguise of National Guards had entered Paris as spies and were simply arrested.

  13 soldiers of the line made prisoners at the railway station of Clamart were shot off-hand, and all prisoners wearing the line uniforms who arrive in Versailles will be executed whenever doubts about their identity are cleared up.

   The different movements at Paris in the beginning of October aimed at the establishment of the Commune, as a measure of defence against the foreign invasion, as the realization of the rise of the 4th of September.

As they had slipt into power the 4th of September by a surprise, they were now enabled to give it a mock sanction by a plebiscite of the true Bonapartist pattern during days of reactionary terror.

  The victorious establishment at Paris of the Commune in the beginning of November 1870 (then already initiated in the great cities of the [country] and sure to be imitated all over France) would not only have taken the defence out of the hands of traitors, and imprinted its enthusiasm [on it] as the present heroic war of Paris shows, it would have altogether changed the character of the war. It would have become the war of Republican France, hissing<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp166">*</A>]</FONT> the flag of the Social Revolution of the 19th century, against Prussia, the banner bearer of the conquest and counter-revolution. Instead of sending the hackneyed old intriguer a-begging at all courts of Europe, it would have electrified the producing masses in the old and the new world. By the <I>escamotage</I> of the Commune on October 31, the Jules Favre <I>et</I> Co. secured the capitulation of France to Prussia and initiated the present civil war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But this much is shown: The Revolution of the 4th September was not only the reinstalment of the Republic because the place of the usurper had become vacant by his capitulation at Sedan -- it not only conquered that Republic from the foreign invader by the prolonged resistance of Paris although fighting under the leadership of its enemies -- that Revolution was working its way in[to] the heart of the working classes. The Republic had ceased to be a name for a thing of the past. It was impregnated with a new world. Its real tendency, veiled from the eye of the world through the deceptions, the lies and the vulgarizing of a pack of intriguing lawyers and word fencers, came again and again to the surface in the spasmodic movements of the Paris working classes (and the South of France) whose watchword was always the same, the <I>Commune </I>!

the Empire and the conditions of its existence -- first essayed in the cities of Southern France, again and again proclaimed in spasmodic movements during the siege of Paris and <I>escamot&eacute;s</I> [conjured away] by the sleights of hands of the Government of Defence and the Bretons of Trochu, the "plan of capitulation" hero -- was at last victoriously installed on the 26th March, but it had not suddenly sprung into life on that day. It was the unchangeable goal of the workmen's revolution. The capitulation of Paris, the open conspiracy against the Republic at Bordeaux, the <I>coup d'&eacute;tat</I> initiated by the nocturnal attack on Montmartre, rallied around it all the living elements of Paris, no longer allowing the defence men to limit it to the insulated efforts of the most conscious and revolutionary portions of the Paris working class. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Government of Defence was only undergone as a <I>pis aller</I> [makeshift] of the first surprise, a necessity of the war. The true answer of the Paris people to the Second Empire, the Empire of Lies, was the Commune. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus also the rising of all living Paris -- with the exception of the pillars of Bonapartism and its official opposition, the great capitalists, the financial jobbers, the sharpers, the loungers, and the old State parasites -- against the Government of Defence does not date from the 18th of March, although it conquered on that day its first victory against the <I>conspiration</I> [conspiracy]; it dates from the 31 January<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT>, from the very day of the capitulation. The National Guard -- that is all the armed manhood of Paris -- organized itself and really ruled Paris from that day, independently of the usurpatory government of the <I>capitulards</I> installed by the grace of Bismarck. It refused to deliver its arms and artillery, which was

its property and only left them in the capitulation[?] because its property.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp168">*</A>]</FONT> It was not the magnanimity of Jules Favre that saved these arms from Bismarck, but the readiness of armed Paris to fight for its arms against Jules Favre and Bismarck. In view of the foreign invader and the peace negotiations Paris would not complicate the situation. It was afraid of civil war. It observed a mere attitude of defence and content with the de facto self-rule of Paris. But it organized itself quietly and steadfastly for resistance. (Even in the terms of the capitulation itself the <I>capitulards</I> had unmistakably shown their tendency to make the surrender to Prussia at the same time the means of their domination over Paris. The only concession of Prussia they insisted upon, a concession, which Bismarck would have imposed upon them as a condition, if they had not begged it as a concession -- was 40,000 soldiers for subduing Paris. In the face of its 300,000 National Guards -- more than sufficient for securing Paris from an attempt by the foreign enemy, and for the defence of its internal order -- the demand of these 40,000 men -- a thing which was besides avowed -- could have no other purpose.) On its existing military organization it grafted a political federation according to a very simple plan. It was the alliance of all the Guard <I>nationale</I>, put in connection the one with the other <I>by the delegates</I> of each company, appointing in their turn the delegates of the <I>bataillons</I>, who in their turn appointed general delegates, generals of legions, who were to represent an <I>arrondissement</I> and to co-operate with the delegates of the 19 other <I>arrondissements.</I> Those 20 delegates, chosen by the majority of the <I>bataillons</I> of the National

Never were elections more sifted, never delegates fuller representing the masses from which they had sprung. To the objection of the outsiders that they were unknown -- in point of fact, that they only were known to the working classes, but no old stagers, no men illustrious by the infamies of their past, by their chase after pelf and place -- they proudly answered: "So were the 12 Apostles," and they answered by their deeds.

</FONT></CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp                    
  The centralized State machinery which, with its ubiquitous and complicated military, bureaucratic, clerical and judiciary organs, entoils (inmeshes) the living civil society like a boa constrictor, was first forged in the days of absolute monarchy as a weapon of nascent modern society in its struggle of emancipation from feudalism. The seignorial privileges of the medieval lords and cities and clergy were transformed into the attributes of a unitary State power, displacing the feudal dignitaries by salaried State functionaries, transferring the arms from medieval retainers of the landlords and the corporations of townish citizens to a standing army, substituting for the checkered (party-coloured) anarchy of conflicting medieval powers the regulated plan of a State power, with a systematic and hierarchic division of labour. The first French Revolution with its task to found national unity (to create a nation) had to break down all local, territorial, townish and provincial independence. It was, therefore, forced to develop, what absolute monarchy had commenced, the centralization and organization of State power, and to expand the circumference and the at- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 170</B></FONT><P>

tributes of the State power, the number of its tools, its independence, and its supernaturalist sway of real society, which in fact took the place of the medieval supernaturalist heaven, with its saints. Every minor solitary interest engendered by the relations of social groups was separated from society itself, fixed and made independent of it and opposed to it in the form of State interest, administered by State priests with exactly determined hierarchical functions. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This parasitical [excrescence upon] civil society, pretending to be its ideal counterpart, grew to its full development under the sway of the first Bonaparte. The Restoration and the Monarchy of July added nothing to it but a greater division of labour, growing at the same measure in which the division of labour within civil society created new groups of interest, and, therefore, new material for State action. In their struggle against the Revolution of 1848, the Parliamentary Republic of France and the governments of all continental Europe, were forced to strengthen, with their measures of repression against the popular movement, the means of action and the centralization of that governmental power. All revolutions thus only perfected the State machinery instead of throwing off this deadening incubus. The fractions and parties of the ruling classes which alternately struggled for supremacy, considered the occupancy (control) (seizure) and the direction of this immense machinery of government as the main booty of the victor. It centred in the creation of immense standing armies, a host of State vermin, and huge national debts. During the time of the absolute monarchy it was a means of the struggle of modern society against feudalism, crowned by the French Revolution, and under the first Bonaparte it served not only to subjugate the Revolution and annihilate all popular liberties, it was an instrument of the French Revolution to strike abroad, to create 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 171</B></FONT><P>

for France on the Continent instead of feudal monarchies more or less States after the image of France. Under the Restoration and the Monarchy of July it became not only [a] means of the forcible class domination of the middle class, and [<I>read</I> but] a means of adding to the direct economic exploitation a second exploitation of the people by assuring to their [i.e., the middle class] families all the rich places of the State household. During the time of the revolutionary struggle of 1848 at last it served as a means of annihilating that Revolution and all aspirations at the emancipation of the popular masses. But the State parasite received only its last development during the Second Empire. The governmental power with its standing army, its all directing bureaucracy, its stultifying clergy and its servile tribunal hierarchy had grown so independent of society itself, that a grotesquely mediocre adventurer with a hungry band of desperadoes behind him sufficed to wield it. It did no longer want the pretext of an armed Coalition of old Europe against the modern world founded by the Revolution of 1789. It appeared no longer as a means of class domination, subordinate to its parliamentary ministry or legislature. Humbling under its sway even the interests of the ruling classes, whose parliamentary show work it supplanted by self-elected <I>Corps l&eacute;gislatifs</I> and self-paid senates, sanctioned in its absolute sway by universal suffrage, the acknowledged necessity for keeping up "order," that is the rule of the landowner and the capitalist over the producer, cloaking under the tatters of a masquerade of the past the orgies of the corruption of the present and the victory of the most parasite fraction, the financial swindler, the <I>debauchery</I> of all the reactionary influences of the past let loose -- a pandemonium of infamies -- the State power had received its last and supreme expression in the Second Empire. Apparently the final victory of this governmental power over 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 172</B></FONT><P>

society, it was in fact the orgy of all the corrupt elements of that society. To the eye of the uninitiated it appeared only as the victory of the Executive over the Legislative, of [<I>read</I> as] the final defeat of the form of class rule pretending to be the autocracy of society [by] its form pretending to be a superior power to society. But in fact it was only the last degraded and the only possible form of that class ruling, as humiliating to those classes themselves as to the working classes which they kept fettered by it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The 4th of September was only the revindication of the <I>R&eacute;publique</I> against the grotesque adventurer that had assassinated it. The true antithesis to <I>the Empire itself</I> -- that is, to the State power, the centralized executive, of which the Second Empire was only the exhausting formula -- was <I>the Commune.</I> This State power forms in fact the creation of the middle class, first [as] a means to break down feudalism, then [as] a means to crush the emancipatory aspirations of the producers, of the working class. All reactions and all revolutions had only served to transfer that organized power -- that organized force of the slavery of labour -- from one hand to the other, from one fraction of the ruling classes to the other. It had served the ruling classes as a means of subjugation and of pelf. It had sucked new forces from every new change. It had served as the instrument of breaking down every popular rise<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> and served it to crush the working classes after they had fought and been ordered to secure its transfer from one part of its oppressors to the others. This was, therefore, a revolution not against this or that, legitimate, constitutional, republican or imperialist form of State power. It was a revolution against the State itself, of this supernaturalist abortion of society, a resumption

by the people for the people of its own social life. It was not a revolution to transfer it from one fraction of the ruling classes to the other, but a revolution to break down this horrid machinery of class domination itself. It was not one of those dwarfish struggles between the executive and the parliamentary forms of class domination, but a revolt against both these forms, integrating each other, and of which the parliamentary form was only the deceitful bywork of the Executive. The Second Empire was the final form of this State usurpation. The Commune was its definite negation, and, therefore, the initiation of the Social Revolution of the 19th century. Whatever therefore its fate at Paris, it will make <I>le tour du monde</I> [a trip round the world]. It was at once acclaimed by the working class of Europe and the United States as the magic word of delivery. The glories and the antediluvian deeds of the Prussian conqueror seemed only hallucinations of a bygone past. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>It was only the working class that could</I> formulate by the word "Commune" and initiate by the fighting Commune of Paris -- this new aspiration. Even the last expression of that State power in the Second Empire, although humbling for the pride of the ruling classes and casting to the winds their parliamentary pretensions of self-government, had been only the last possible form of their class rule. While politically dispossessing them, it was the orgy under which all the economic and social infamies of their <I>r&eacute;gime</I> got full sway. The middling bourgeoisie and the petty middle class were by their economical conditions of life excluded from initiating a new revolution and induced to follow in the track of the ruling classes or [to become] the followers of the working class. The peasants were the passive economical basis of the Second Empire, of that last triumph of a <I>State</I> separate of and independent from society. Only the proletarians, fired by a new social task to accomplish 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 176</B></FONT><P>

by them for all society, to do away with all classes and class rule, were the men to break the instrument of that class rule -- the State, the centralized and organized governmental power usurping to be the master instead of the servant of society. In the active struggle against them by the ruling classes, supported by the passive adherence of the peasantry, the Second Empire, the last crowning at the same time as the most signal prostitution of the State -- which had taken the place of the medieval Church -- had been engendered. It had sprung into life against them. By them it was broken, not as a peculiar form of governmental (centralized) power, but as its most powerful expression, elaborated into seeming independence from society, and, therefore, also its most prostitute reality, covered by infamy from top to bottom, having centred in absolute corruption at home and absolute powerlessness abroad. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But this one form of class rule had only broken down to make the Executive, the governmental State machinery the great and single object of attack to the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Parliamentarism in France had come to an end. Its last term and fullest sway was the Parliamentary Republic from May 1848 to the <I>coup d'&eacute;tat.</I> The Empire that killed it, was its own creation. Under the Empire with its <I>Corps l&eacute;gislatif</I> and its Senate -- in this form it has been reproduced in the military monarchies of Prussia and Austria -- it had been a mere farce, a mere bywork of despotism in its crudest form. Parliamentarism then was dead in France and the workmen's revolution certainly was not to awaken it from this death. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The <I>Commune</I> -- the reabsorption of the State power by society as its own living forces instead of as forces controlling and subduing it, by the popular masses themselves, forming their own force instead of the organized force of their suppression -- the political form of their social emancipation, instead 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 175</B></FONT><P>

of the artificial force (appropriated by their oppressors) (their own force opposed to and organized against them) of society wielded for their oppression by their enemies. The form was simple like all great things. The reaction of former revolutions -- the time wanted for all historical developments, and in the past always lost in all revolutions, in the very days of popular triumph, whenever it had rendered its victorious arms, to be turned against itself -- first by displacing the army by the National Guard.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp175">*</A>]</FONT>

The general suffrage, till now abused either for the parliamentary sanction of the Holy State Power, or a play<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp176">*</A>]</FONT> in the hands of the ruling classes, only employed by the people to sanction (choose the instruments of) parliamentary class rule once in many years, [is] adapted to its real purposes, to choose by the Communes their own functionaries of administration and initiation.

daylight, with no pretensions to infallibility, not hiding itself behind circumlocution offices, not ashamed to confess blunders by correcting them. Making in one order the public functions -- military, administrative, political -- <I>real workmen's functions</I>, instead of the hidden attributes of a trained caste; (keeping order in the turbulence of civil war and revolution) (initiating measures of general regeneration). Whatever the merits of the single measures of the Commune, its greatest measure was its own organization, extemporized with the foreign enemy at one door, and the class enemy at the other, proving by its life its vitality, confirming its thesis by its action. Its appearance was a victory over the victors of France. Captive Paris resumed by one bold spring the leadership of Europe, not depending on brute force, but by taking the lead of the social movement, by giving body to the aspirations of the working class of all countries. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   With all the great towns organized into Communes after the model of Paris, no government could repress the movement by the surprise of sudden reaction. Even by this preparatory step the time of incubation, the guarantee of the movement, came. All France [would be] organized into self-working and self-governing Communes, the standing army replaced by the popular militias, the army of State parasites removed, the clerical hierarchy displaced by the schoolmaster, the State judge transformed into Communal organs, the suffrage for the national representation not a matter of sleight of hand for an all-powerful government but the deliberate expression of organized Communes, the State functions reduced to a few functions for general national purposes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Such is the <I>Commune -- the political form of the social emancipation</I>, of the liberation of labour from the usurpations (slaveholding) of the monopolists of the means of labour, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 178</B></FONT><P>

created by the labourers themselves or forming the gift of nature. As the State machinery and parliamentarism are not the real life of the ruling classes, but only the organized general organs of their dominion, the political guarantees and forms and expressions of the old order of things, so the Commune is not the social movement of the working class and therefore of a general regeneration of mankind, but the organized means of action. The Commune does not [do] away with the class struggles, through which the working classes strive to [<I>read</I> for] the abolition of all classes and, therefore, of all classes [class rule] (because it does not represent a peculiar interest, it represents the liberation of "labour," that is the fundamental and natural condition of individual and social life which only by usurpation, fraud, and artificial contrivances can be shifted from the few upon the many), but it affords the rational medium in which that class struggle can run through its different phases in the most rational and humane way. It could start violent reactions and as violent revolutions. It begins the <I>emancipation of labour</I> -- its great goal -- by doing away with the unproductive and mischievous work of the State parasites, by cutting away the springs which sacrifice an immense portion of the national produce to the feeding of the State monster on the one side, by doing, on the other, the real work of administration, local and national, for working men's wages. It begins therefore with an immense saving, with economical reform as well as political transformation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Communal organization once firmly established on a national scale, the catastrophes it might still have to undergo, would be sporadic slaveholders' insurrections, which, while for a moment interrupting the work of peaceful progress, would only accelerate the movement, by putting the sword into the hands of the Social Revolution. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 179</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The working class know that they have to pass through different phases of class struggle. They know that the superseding of the economical conditions of the slavery of labour by the conditions of free and associated labour can only be the progressive work of time (that economical transformation), that they require not only a change of distribution, but a new organization of production, or rather the delivery (setting free) of the social forms of production in present organized labour (engendered by present industry), of [<I>read</I> from] the trammels of slavery, of [<I>read</I> from] their present class character, and their harmonious national and international co-ordination. They know that this work of regeneration will be again and again relented<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp179">*</A>]</FONT> and impeded by the resistance of vested interests and class egotisms. They know that the present "spontaneous action of the natural laws of capital and landed property" can only be superseded by "the spontaneous action of the laws of the social economy of free and associated labour" by a long process of development of new conditions, as was the "spontaneous action of the economic laws of slavery" and the "spontaneous action of the economical laws of serfdom." But they know at the same time that great strides may be [made] at once through the Communal form of political organization and that the time has come to begin that movement for themselves and mankind.

The liquidation of the war costs is to be decided by the civil war. The Commune represents on this vital point not only the interests of the working class, the petty middle class, in fact, all the middle class with the exception of the <I>bourgeoisie</I> (the wealthy capitalists) (the rich landowners, and their State parasites).

parasitical and costly State machinery, the Commune will give him a cheap government. The Party of Order will continue [to] grind him down by the townish usurer, the Commune will free him of the incubus of the mortgages lasting upon his plot of land. The Commune will replace the parasitical judiciary body eating the heart of his income -- the notary, the <I>huissier</I>, etc. --  [by] Communal agents doing their work at workmen's salaries, instead of enriching himself out of the peasant's work. It will break down this whole judiciary cobweb which entangles the French peasant and gives abodes to the judiciary bench and <I>maires</I> of the bourgeois spiders that suck its blood! The Party of Order will keep him under the rule of the gendarme, the Commune will restore him to independent, social and political life! The Commune will enlighten him by the rule of the schoolmaster, the Party of Order force upon him the stultification by the rule of the priest! But the French peasant is above all a man of reckoning! He will find it exceedingly reasonable that the payment of the clergy will no longer [be] exacted from him by the tax-collector, but will be left to the "spontaneous action" of his religious instinct!

   The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte President of the Republic, but the Party of Order (during the anonymous <I>r&eacute;gime</I> of the Republic under the assembly <I>constituante</I> and <I>l&eacute;gislative </I>) was the creator of the Empire! What the French peasant really wants, he commenced to show in 1849 and 1852 by opposing his <I>maire</I> to the government's prefect, his schoolmaster to the<A NAME="p181"> government's parson, himself to the government's gendarme! The nucleus of the reactionary laws of the Party of Order in 1849 -- and peculiarly in January and February 1850<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en85">85</A>]</FONT> --  were specifically directed against the French peasantry! If the French peasant had made Louis Bonaparte President of the Republic because in his tradition all the ben- 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 182</B></FONT><P>

efits he had derived from the first Revolution were phantastically transferred on the first Napoleon, the armed risings of peasants in some departments of France and the gendarme hunting upon them after the <I>coup d'&eacute;tat</I> proved that that delusion was rapidly breaking down! The Empire was founded on the delusions artificially nourished into power and [on] traditional prejudices, the Commune would be founded on his living interests and his real wants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The hatred of the French peasant is centring on the "Rurals," the men of the <I>Ch&acirc;teau</I>, the men of the milliard of indemnity and the townish capitalist, masqueraded into [<I>read</I> as] a landed proprietor, whose encroachment upon him marched never more rapidly than under the Second Empire, partly fostered by artificial State means, partly naturally growing out of the very development of modern agriculture. The "Rurals" know that three months' rule of the Republican Empire in France would be the signal of the rising of the peasantry and the agricultural proletariat against them. Hence their ferocious hatred of the Commune! What they fear even more than the emancipation of the townish proletariat is the emancipation of the peasants. The peasants would soon acclaim the townish proletariat as their own leaders and seniors. There exists of course in France as in most continental countries a deep antagonism between the townish and rural producers, between the industrial proletariat and the peasantry. The aspirations of the proletariat, the material basis of its movement is labour organized on a grand scale, although now despotically organized, and the means of production centralized, although now centralized in the hands of the monopolist, not only as a means of production, but as a means of the exploitation and enslavement of the <I>producteur</I> [producers]. What the proletariat has to do is to transform the present capi-

talist character of that organized labour and those centralized means of labour, to transform them from the means of class rule and class exploitation into forms of free associated labour and social means of production. On the other hand, the labour of the peasant is insulated and the means of production are parcelled, dispersed. On these economical differences rests superconstructed<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp183">*</A>]</FONT> a whole world of different social and political views. But this peasantry proprietorship has long since outgrown its normal phase, that is, the phase in which it was a reality, a mode of production and a form of property which responded to the economical wants of society and placed the rural producers themselves into normal conditions of life. It has entered its period of decay. On the one side a large <I>prol&eacute;tariat foncier</I> (rural proletariat) has grown out of it, whose interests are identical with those of the townish wages labourers. The mode of production itself has become superannuated by the modern progress of agronomy. Lastly -- the peasant proprietorship itself has become nominal, leaving to the peasant the delusion of proprietorship and expropriating him from the fruits of his own labour. The competition of the great farm producers, the blood-tax, the State tax, the usury of the townish mortgagee and the multitudinous pilfering of the judiciary system thrown around him, have degraded him to the position of a Hindoo ryot, while expropriation -- even expropriation from his nominal proprietorship -- and his degradation into a rural proletarian is an everyday fact. What separates the peasant from the proletarian is, therefore, no longer his real interest, but his delusive prejudice. If the Commune, as we have shown, is the only power that can give him

Being immediately benefited by the Communal Republic, he would soon confide in it.

  We have seen that the Paris proletarian fights for the French peasant, and Versailles fights against him; that the greatest anxiety of the <I>Ruraux</I> is that Paris be heard by the peasant and no longer separated by [<I>read</I> from] him through the blockade; that at the bottom of its war upon Paris is the attempt to keep the peasantry as its bondman and treat him as before as its <I>mati&egrave;re</I> "taillable &agrave; merci et mis&eacute;ricorde" [its object "liable to pay taxes at its mercy and behest"]. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For the first time in history the petty and <I>moyenne</I> middle class [petty and middle bourgeoisie] has openly rallied round the workmen's Revolution, and proclaimed it as the only means of their own salvation and that of France! It forms with them the bulk of the National Guard, it sits with them in the Commune, it mediates for them in the Union r&eacute;publicaine! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The principal measures taken by the Commune are taken for the salvation of the middle class -- the debtor class of Paris against the creditor class! That middle class had rallied in the June insurrection (1848) against the proletariat under the banners<A NAME="p185"> of the capitalist class, their generals, and their State parasites. It was punished at once on the 19 September 1848 by the rejection of the "concordats &agrave; l'amiable."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en79">79</A>]</FONT> The victory over the June insurrection showed itself at once also as the victory of the creditor, the wealthy capitalist over the debtor, the middle class. It insisted mercilessly on its pound of flesh. On the 13th June, 1849 the National Guard of that middle class was disarmed and sabred down by the army of the bourgeoisie!

During the Empire, [as a result of] the dilapidation of the State resources, upon which the wealthy capitalist fed, this middle class was delivered to the plunder of the stock-jobber, the railway kings, the swindling associations of the Cr&eacute;dit mobilier, etc., and expropriated by capitalist association (joint-stock company). If lowered in its political position, attacked in its economical interests, it was morally revolted by the orgies of that <I>r&eacute;gime.</I> The infamies of the war gave the last shock and roused its feelings as Frenchmen. [Considering] the disasters bestowed upon France by that war, its crisis of national breakdown and its financial ruin, this middle class feels that not the corrupt class of the would-be slaveholders of France, but only the manly aspirations and the herculean power of the working class can come to the rescue! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   They feel that only the working class can emancipate them from priest rule, convert science from an instrument of class rule into a popular force, convert the men of science themselves from the panderers to class prejudice, place-hunting State parasites, and allies of capital into free agents of thought! Science can only play its genuine part in the Republic of Labour.

  This civil war has destroyed the last delusions about [the] "Republic," as the Empire [destroyed] the delusion of unorganized "universal suffrage" in the hands of the State gendarme and the parson. All vital elements of France acknowledge that a Republic is only in France and Europe possible as a "Social Republic," that is a Republic which disowns the capital and landowner class of the State machinery to supersede it by the Commune, that frankly avows "social emancipation" as the

The other Republic can be nothing but the <I>anonymous</I> terrorism of all monarchical fractions, of the combined Legitimists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists to land in an Empire <I>quelconque</I> [of any kind] as its final goal, the <I>anonymous</I> terror of class rule which having done its dirty work will always burst into an Empire!

   The professional Republicans of the Rural Assembly are men who really believe, despite the experiments of 1848-51, despite the civil war against Paris -- the <I>Republican form</I> of class despotism [to be] a possible, lasting form, while the "Party of Order" demands it only as a form of conspiracy for fighting the Republic and reintroducing its only adequate form, monarchy or rather imperialism, as the form of class despotism. In 1848 these voluntary dupes were pushed in the foreground till, by the insurrection of June, they had paved the way for the <I>anonymous</I> rule of all fractions of the would-be slaveholders in France. In 1871, at Versailles, they are from [the] beginning pushed in the background, there to figure as the "Republican" decoration of Thiers' rule and sanction by their presence the war of the Bonapartist generals<A NAME="p187"> upon Paris!

Revolution has in common with all its predecessors. The new feature is that the people, after the first rise, have not disarmed themselves and surrendered their power into the hands of the Republican mountebanks of the ruling classes, that, by the constitution of the <I>Commune</I>, they have taken the actual management of their Revolution into their own hands and found at the same time, in the case of success, the means to hold it in the hands of the people itself, displacing the State machinery, the governmental machinery of the ruling classes by a governmental machinery of their own. This is their ineffable crime! Workmen infringing upon the governmental privilege of the upper 10,000 and proclaiming their will to break the economical basis of that class despotism which for its own sake wielded the organized State force of society! This is it that has thrown the respectable classes in Europe as in the United States into the paroxysm of convulsions and accounts for their shrieks of abomination [that] it is blasphemy, [and for] their fierce appeals to assassination of the people and the billingsgate of abuse and calumny from their parliamentary tribunes and their journalistic servants' hall!

As to their measures, they must, by the nature of things, be principally confined to the military defence of Paris and its <I>approvisionnement</I> [supply]!

These benevolent patronizers, profoundly ignorant of the real aspirations and the real movement of the working classes, forget one thing. All the socialist founders of sects belong to a period in which the working class themselves were neither sufficiently trained and organized by the march of capitalist society itself to enter as historical agents upon the world's stage, nor were the material conditions of their emancipation sufficiently matured in the old world itself. Their misery existed, but the conditions of their own movement did not yet exist. The utopian founders of sects, while in their criticism of present society clearly describing the goal of the social movement, the supersession of the wages system with all its economical conditions of class rule, found neither in society itself the material conditions of its transformation, nor in the working class the organized power and the <I>conscience</I> [consciousness] of the movement. They tried to compensate for the historical conditions of the movement by phantastic pictures and plans of a new society in whose propaganda they saw the true means of salvation. From the moment the working-men class movement became real, the phantastic utopias evanesced, not because the working class had given up the end aimed at by these Utopists, but because they had found the real means to realize

them, but in their place came a real insight into the historic conditions of the movement and a more and more gathering force of the military organization of the working class. But the last 2 ends of the movement proclaimed by the Utopians are the last ends proclaimed by the Paris Revolution and by the International. Only the means are different and the real conditions of the movement are no longer clouded in utopian fables. These patronizing friends of the proletariat, in glossing over the loudly proclaimed socialist tendencies of this Revolution, are therefore but the dupes of their own ignorance. It is not the fault of the Paris proletariat, if for them the utopian creations of the prophets of the working-men movement are still the "Social Revolution," that is to say, if the Social Revolution is for them still "utopian."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp

   The <I>chauvinism</I> of the bourgeoisie is only a vanity, giving a national cloak to all their own pretensions. It is a means, by permanent armies, to perpetuate international struggles, to subjugate in each country the producers by pitching them against their brothers in each other country, a means to prevent the international co-operation of the working classes, the first condition of their emancipation. The true character of that chauvinism (long since become a mere phrase) has come out during the war of defence after Sedan, everywhere paralysed by the chauvinist bourgeoisie in the capitulation of France,<A NAME="p192"> in the civil war carried on under that high priest of chauvinism, Thiers, on Bismarck's sufferance! It came out in the petty police intrigue of the Anti-German League,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en162">162</A>]</FONT> [in the] foreigners hunting in Paris after the capitulation. It was hoped that the Paris people (and the French people) could be stultified into the passion of national hatred and by factitious outrages to the foreigner forget its real aspiration and its home betrayers!

   How has this factitious movement disappeared (vanished) before the breath of revolutionary Paris! Loudly proclaiming

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And while their bourgeois chauvins have dismembered France, and act under the dictatorship of the foreign invasion, the Paris workmen have beaten the foreign enemy by striking at their own class rulers, have abolished fractions, in conquering the post as the vanguard of the workmen of all nations!

   The genuine patriotism of the bourgeoisie -- so natural for the real proprietors of the different "national" estates -- has faded into a mere sham consequent upon the cosmopolitan character imprinted upon their financial, commercial, and industrial enterprise.

On the other hand, the government, the rural magnate, the gendarme and the priest, into whose hands the whole influence of the provinces was thus thrown by the centralized State machinery centring at Paris, brought this influence to bear for the government and the classes whose government it was, not against [the] Paris [of] the government, the parasite, the capitalist, the idle, the cosmopolitan stew, but against the Paris of the workman and the thinker. In this way, by the government centralization with Paris as its base, the peasants were suppressed by the Paris of the government and the capitalist and the Paris of the workmen was suppressed by the provincial power handed<A NAME="p194"> over into the hands of the enemies of the peasants.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
   Mr. Thiers, in his tour through the provinces, managed the elections, and above all, his own manifold elections. But there was one difficulty. The Bonapartist provincials had for the moment become impossible. (Besides, he did not want them, nor did they want him.) Many of the old Orleanist stagers had merged into the Bonapartist lot. It was, therefore, necessary, to appeal to the rusticated Legitimist landowners who had kept quite aloof from politics and were just the men to be duped. They have given the apparent character to the Versailles Assembly, its character of the "<I>Chambre introuvable </I>" of Louis XVIII, its "Rural" character. In their vanity, they believed, of course, that their time had at last come with the downfall of the Second Bonapartist Empire and under the shelter of foreign invasion, as it had come in 1814 and 1815. Still they are mere dupes. So far as they act, they can only act as elements of the "Party of Order," and its "anonymous" terrorism as in 1848-1851. Their own party effusions lend only the comical character to that association. They are, therefore, forced to suffer as president the jail-<I>accoucheur</I> of the Duchess of Berry and as their ministers the pseudo-Republicans of the Government of Defence. They will be pushed aside as soon as they have done their service. But -- a trick of history -- by this curious combination of circumstances they are forced to attack Paris because of revolting against "the <I>R&eacute;publique une et indivisible </I>" 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 196</B></FONT><P>

[the Republic, one and indivisible] (Louis Blanc expresses it so, Thiers calls it unity of France) while their very first exploit was to revolt against unity by declaring for the "decapitation and decapitalization" of Paris, by wanting the Assembly to throne in a provincial town. What they really want is to go back to what preceded the centralized State machinery, become more or less independent of its prefects and its ministers, and put into its place the provincial and local domainial influence of the <I>Ch&acirc;teaux.</I> They want a reactionary <I>decentralization</I> of France. What Paris wants is to supplant that centralization which has done its service against feodality, but has become the mere unity of an artificial body, resting on gendarmes, red and black armies, repressing the life of real society, lasting as an incubus upon it, giving Paris an "apparent omnipotence" by enclosing it and leaving the provinces outdoor* -- to supplant this unitarian France which exists besides the French society, by the political union of French society itself through the Communal organization. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The true partisans of breaking up the unity of France are therefore the Rurals, opposed to the united State machinery so far as it interferes with their own local importance (seignorial rights), so far as it is the antagonist of feudalism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What Paris wants is to break up that factitious unitarian system, so far as it is the antagonist of the real living union of France and a mere means of Class rule.

negation to that system. They can of course not comprehend that the social transformation the working class aim at is the necessary, historical, unavoidable birth<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp197">*</A>]</FONT> of the present system itself. They talk in deprecatory tones of the threatened abolition of "property," because in their eyes their present class form of property -- a transitory historical form -- is property itself, and the abolition of that form would therefore be the abolition of property. As they now defend the "charity" of capital rule and the wages system, if they had lived in feudal times or in times of slavery they would have defended the feudal system and the slave system, as founded on the nature of things, as a spontaneous outgrowth[?] springing from nature; [they would have] fiercely declaimed against their "abuses," but at the same time from the height of their ignorance answering to the prophecies of their abolition by the dogma of their "charity" weighed by "moral checks" ("constraints"). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   They are as right in their appreciation of the aims of the Paris working classes, as is M.

  How the breath of the popular revolution has changed Paris! The Revolution of February was called the revolution of moral contempt. It was proclaimed by the cries of the people, "<I>A bas les grands voleurs! A bas les assassins! </I>" ["Down with the big thieves! Down with the assassins!"] Such was the sentiment of the people. But as to the bourgeoisie, they wanted broader sway for corruption! They got it under Louis Bonaparte's (Napoleon the Little's) reign. Paris, the gigantic town, the town of historic initiative, was transformed in[to] the <I>maison dor&eacute;e</I> ["gilded house" -- brothel] of all the idlers and swindlers of the world, into a cosmopolitan stew! After the exodus of the "better class of people," the Paris of the working class reappeared, heroic, self-sacrificing, enthusiastic in the sentiment of its herculean task! No cadavers in the Morgue, no insecurity of the streets. Paris was never more quiet within. Instead of the <I>cocottes</I>, the heroic women of Paris! Manly, stern, fighting, working, thinking Paris!

   Roused on the one hand by Jules Favre's call to civil war in the Assembly -- he told that the Prussians had threatened to interfere, if the Parisians did not give in at once -- encouraged by the forbearance of the people and the passive attitude towards them of the Central Committee, the "Party of Order" at Paris resolved on a <I>coup de main</I>, which came off on the 22 March under the etiquette of a <I>Peaceful Procession</I>, a peaceable demonstration against the Revolutionary Government. And it was a peaceful demonstration of a very peculiar character. "The whole movement seemed a surprise. There were no preparations to meet it." "A riotous mob of gentlemen," in their first rank the familiars of the Empire, the Heeckeren, Co&euml;tlogon, and H. de P&egrave;ne, etc., ill-treating and disarming National Guards detached from advanced sentinels (sentries), who fled to the Place Vend&ocirc;me whence the National Guards march at once to the Rue Neuve-des-

Down with the Committee!", insult the guards, grasp at their muskets, shoot with a revolver citizen <I>Maljournal</I> (<I>lieutenant d'&eacute;tat-major de la place </I>) (<I>membre du Comit&eacute; central</I>) [(lieutenant of the staff at the Place) (member of the Central Committee)]. General Bergeret calls upon them to withdraw (disband) (retire). During about 5 minutes the drums are beaten and the sommations (replacing the English reading of the Riot Act) made. They reply by cries of insult. Two National Guards fall severely wounded. Meanwhile their comrades hesitate and fire into the air. <I>The rioters try to forcibly break through the lines and to disarm them.</I> Bergeret commands fire and the cowards fly. The <I>&eacute;meute</I> [riot] is at once dispersed and the fire ceases. Shots are fired from houses on the National Guards. Two of them, Wahlin and Fran&ccedil;ois are killed, eight are wounded. The streets through which the "pacific" disband are strewn with revolvers and sword-canes (many of them picked up in the Rue de la Paix). Vicomte de Molinet, killed from behind (by his own people), [is] found with a <I>dagger</I> fixed by a chain. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Rappel was beaten.</I> A number of cane-swords, revolvers, and daggers lay on the streets by which the "unarmed" demonstration had passed. Pistol-shots were fired before the insurgents received orders to fire on the crowd. The manifestors were the aggressors (witnessed by General Sheridan from a window). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This was then simply an attempt to do by the reactionists of Paris, armed with revolvers, cane-swords, and daggers, what Vinoy had failed to do with his <I>sergents de ville</I>, soldiers, cannon and <I>mitrailleuse.</I> That the "lower orders" of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 208</B></FONT><P>

Paris allowed themselves not even to be disarmed by the "gentlemen" of Paris, was really too bad! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When on the 13th June, 1849 the National Guards of Paris made a really "unarmed" and "pacific" procession to protest against a crime, the attack on Rome by the French troops, General Changarnier was praised by his intimate Thiers for sabring and shooting them down. The state of siege was declared, new laws of repression, new proscriptions, a new reign of terror! Instead of all that, the Central Committee and the workmen of Paris strictly kept on the defensive, during the encounter itself, allowed the assailers (the gentlemen of the dagger), to return quietly home, and, by their indulgence, by not calling them to account for this daring enterprise, encouraged them so much that two days later, under the leadership of Admiral Saisset, sent from Versailles, [they] rallied again and tried again their hands at civil war. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And this Vend&ocirc;me Affair evoked at Versailles a cry of "assassination of unarmed citizens," reverberating throughout the world. Be it remarked that even Thiers, while eternally reiterating the assassination of the two generals, has not once dared to remind the world of this "assassination of unarmed citizens." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   As in the medieval times the knight may use any weapon whatever against the plebeian, but the latter must not dare even to defend himself.

   The Republic proclaimed on the 4th [of] September by the Paris workmen, was acclaimed through all France without a single voice of dissent. Its right of life was fought for by a 5 months' defensive war (centring in) based upon the resistance of Paris. Without that war of defence waged in the name of the Republic, William the Conqueror<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> would have restored the Empire of his "good brother" Louis Bonaparte. The cabal of barristers, with Thiers for their statesman, and Trochu for their general,<FONT SIZE=-2>[**]</FONT> installed themselves at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville

at a moment of surprise, when the real leaders of [the] Paris working class were still shut up in Bonapartist prisons and the Prussian army was already marching upon Paris. So deeply were the Thiers, the Jules Favres, the Picards then imbued with the belief in the historical leadership of Paris that they founded their claim as the Government of National Defence upon their having been chosen in the elections to the <I>Corps l&eacute;gislatif</I> in 1869. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In our second address on the late war, five days after the advent of those men, we told you what they were.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp212">*</A>]</FONT> If they had seized the government without consulting Paris, Paris had proclaimed the Republic in the teeth of their resistance. And their first step was to send Thiers begging about at all courts of Europe there to buy if possible foreign mediation, bartering the Republic for a king. Paris did bear with their <I>r&eacute;gime</I> (assumption of power), because they highly professed on their solemn vow to wield that power for the single purpose of <I>national defence.</I> Paris, however, could not be (was not to be) seriously defended without arming the working class, organizing them into a National Guard, and training them through the war itself. But Paris armed was the Social Revolution armed. The victory of Paris over the Prussians would have been a victory of the Republic over French class rule. In this conflict between national duty and class interest the Government of National Defence did not hesitate one moment to turn into a Government of National Defection. In a letter to Gambetta, Jules Favre confessed that what Trochu stood in defence of [<I>read</I> against], was not the Prussian soldier, but the Paris workman. Four months after the commencement of the siege when they thought the opportune

moment come for breaking the first word of capitulation, Trochu, in the presence of Jules Favre and others of his colleagues, addresses the <I>r&eacute;union</I> [meeting] of the <I>maires</I> of Paris in these terms: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The first question, addressed to me by my colleagues on the very evening of the 4th Sept. was this: Paris, can it with any chance of success, stand a siege against the Prussian army? I did not hesitate to answer in the negative. Some of my colleagues here present will warrant the truth of my words, and <I>the persistence of my opinion.</I> I told them, in these very terms, that under the existing state of things, the attempt of Paris to maintain a siege against the Prussian army, would be a folly. Without doubt, I added, it might be a heroic <I>folly</I>, but it would be nothing more. . . . <I>The events</I> (managed by himself) <I>have not given the lie to my prevision. </I>" 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (This little speech of Trochu was after the armistice, published by M. Corbon, one of the <I>maires</I> present. Thus on the very evening of the proclamation of the Republic, Trochu's "plan," known to his colleagues, [was] nothing else but the <I>capitulation of Paris and France.</I> To cure Paris of its "heroic folly," it had to undergo a treatment of decimation and famine, long enough to screen the usurpers of the 4th of September from the vengeance of the December men. If national defence had been more than a false pretence for "government," its self-appointed members would have abdicated on the 5th of September, publicly revealed Trochu's "plan" and called upon the Paris people to at once surrender to the conqueror or take the work of defence in its own hands. Instead of this the imposters published high-sounding manifestoes wherein Trochu, "the governor will never capitulate," and Jules Favre, the Foreign Minister, "not cede a stone of our fortresses, nor a foot of our territory." Through the whole time of the siege Trochu's plan was systematically carried out. In fact the vile Bonapartist cut-throats, to whose trust they gave 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 214</B></FONT><P>

the generalship of Paris, cracked in their intimate correspondence ribald jokes at the well-understood farce of the defence. (See, f.i., the correspondence of <I>Alphonse Simon Guiod</I>, supreme commander of the artillery of the army of defence of Paris and Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, to <I>Suzanne</I>, general of division of artillery, published by the <I>Journal officiel</I> of the Commune.) The mask of imposture was dropped at the capitulation of Paris. The "<I>Government of National Defence </I>" unmasked (resurged) itself as the "<I>government of France by Bismarck's prisoners </I>" -- a part which Louis Bonaparte himself, at Sedan, had considered too infamous even for a man of his stamp. On their wild flight to Versailles, after the events of the 18th March, the <I>capitulards</I> have left in the hands of Paris<A NAME="p214"> the documentary evidence of their treason, to destroy which, as the Commune says in its <I>Manifesto to the Provinces</I>, "they would not recoil from battering Paris into a heap of ruins washed in a sea of blood."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en42">42</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Some of the most influential members of the Government of Defence had moreover urgent private reasons of their own to be passionately bent upon such a consummation. Look only at Jules Favre, Ernest Picard, and Jules Ferry! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Shortly after the conclusion of the armistice, <I>M. Milli&egrave;re</I>, one of the representatives of Paris to the National Assembly, published a series of authentic legal documents in proof that <I>Jules Favre</I>, living in concubinage with the wife of a drunkard, resident at Algiers, had by a most daring concoction of forgeries, spread over many years, contrived to grasp, in the name of the children of his adultery, a large succession which made him a rich man, and that, in a lawsuit undertaken by the legitimate heirs, he only escaped exposure through the connivance of the Bonapartist tribunals. Since those dry legal documents were not to be got rid of by any horsepower of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 215</B></FONT><P>

rhetorics, Jules Favre, in the same heroism of self-abusement, remained for once tongue-tied until the turmoil of the civil war allowed him to brand the Paris people in the Versailles assembly as a band of "escaped convicts" in utter revolt against family, religion, order and property! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   ([<I>The </I>] <I>Pic Affair </I>). This very forger had hardly got into power when he sympathetically hastened to liberate two brother forgers, Pic and Taillefer, who had been under the Empire itself convicted to the hulks for theft and forgery. One of these men, Taillefer, daring to return to Paris after the instalment of the Commune, was at once returned to a convenient abode; and then Jules Favre told all Europe that Paris was setting free all the felonious inhabitants of her prisons! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Ernest Picard</I>, appointed by himself the Home Minister<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> of the French Republic on the 4th of September, after having striven in vain to become the Home Minister of Louis Bonaparte, is the brother of one <I>Arthur Picard</I>, an individual, expulsed from the Paris <I>Bourse</I> as a blackleg (Report of the Prefecture of Police, <I>d.d.</I> 13 July,<FONT SIZE=-2>[**]</FONT> 1867) and convicted on his own confession of a theft of 300,000 francs while a director of one of the branches of the <I>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</I> (see Report of the Prefecture of Police, 11 December, 1868). Both these reports have been still published at the time of the Empire. This Arthur Picard was made by Ernest Picard the <I>r&eacute;dacteur en chef</I> [chief editor] of his <I>Electeur libre</I> to act during the whole siege as his financial go-between, discounting at the <I>Bourse</I> the State secrets in the trust of Ernest and safely speculating

on the disasters of the French army, while the common jobbers were misled by the false news, and official lies, published in the <I>Electeur libre</I>, the organ of the Home Minister. The whole financial correspondence between that worthy pair of brothers has fallen into the hands of the Commune. No wonder that Ernest Picard, the Joe Miller of the Versailles Government, "with his hands in his trousers pockets, walked from group to group cracking jokes," at the first batch of Paris National Guards, made prisoners and exposed to the ferocious outrages of Pi&eacute;tri's lambs. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>Jules Ferry</I>, a penniless barrister before the 4th of September, contrived as the <I>Maire</I> of Paris, to job during the siege a fortune out of the famine which was to a great part the work of his maladministration. The documentary proofs are in the hands of the Commune. The day on which he would have to give an account of his maladministration would be his day of judgment. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   These men therefore are the deadly foes of the working men's Paris, not only as parasites of the ruling classes, not only as the betrayers of Paris during the siege, but above all as common felons who only in the ruins of Paris, this stronghold of the French Revolution, can hope to find their <I>tickets of leave.</I> These desperadoes were exactly the men to become the ministers of Thiers.

  In the "parliamentary sense" things are only a pretext for words, serving as a snare for the adversary, an <I>embuscade</I> [ambuscade] for the people, or a matter of artistic display for the speaker himself.

  Their master M. Thiers, the mischievous gnome, has charmed the French bourgeoisie for almost half a century, because he is the most consummate intellectual expression of their own class corruption. Even before he became a statesman, he had shown his lying powers as a historian. Eager of display, like all dwarfish men, greedy of place and pelf, with a barren intellect but lively fancy, epicurean, sceptical, of an encyclopedic facility for mastering (learning) the surface of things, and turning things into a mere pretext for talk, a word-fencer of rare conversational power, a writer of lucid shallowness, a master of small state roguery, a virtuoso in perjury, a craftsman in all the petty stratagems, cunning devices and base perfidies of parliamentary party-warfare, national and class prejudices standing him in the place of ideas, and vanity in the place of conscience, in order to displace a rival, and to shoot[?] the people, in order to stifle the Revolution, mischievous when in opposition, odious when in power, never scrupling to provoke revolutions, the history of his public life is the chronicle of the miseries of his country. Fond of brandishing with his dwarfish arms in the face of Europe the sword of the first Napoleon,<A NAME="p217"> whose historical shoeblack he had become, his foreign policy always culminated in the utter humiliation of France, from the London convention of 1841*<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en53">53</A>]</FONT> to the Paris capitulation of 1871 and the present civil war he wages under the shelter of Prussian invasion. It need not be said that to such a man the deeper undercurrents of modern society remained a closed book, but even the most palpable changes at its surface were abhorrent to a brain all whose vitality had fled to the tongue. For instance, he never fatigued to denounce any deviation from the old

French protective system as a sacrilege, railways he sneeringly derided, when a minister of Louis Philippe, as a wild chimera, and every reform of the rotten French army system he branded under Louis Bonaparte as a profanation. With all his versatility of talent and shiftiness of purpose, he was steadily wedded to the traditions of a fossilized routine, and never, during his long official career, became guilty of one single, even the smallest measure of practical use. Only the old world's edifice may be proud of being crowned by two such men as Napoleon the Little and little Thiers. The so-called accomplishments of culture appear in such a man only as the refinement of debauchery and the . . . <FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp218">*</A>]</FONT> of selfishness. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Banded with the Republicans under the <I>Restauration</I>, Thiers insinuated himself with Louis Philippe as a spy upon and the jail-<I>accoucheur</I> of the Duchess of Berry, but his activity<A NAME="p218"> when he had first slipt into a ministry (1834-35) centred in the massacre of the insurgent Republicans at the Rue Transnonain and the incubation of the atrocious September laws against the press.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en47">47</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Reappearing as the chief of the cabinet in March 1840 he came out with the plot of the Paris fortifications. To the [protest] of the Republican party against the sinister attempt on the liberty of Paris, he replied: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "What! To fancy that any works of fortification could endanger liberty! And first of all, you calumniate <I>every Government whatever</I> in supposing that it could one day try to maintain itself by bombarding the capital. . . . But it would be [a] hundred times more impossible after its victory than before." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Indeed no French government whatever save that of M. Thiers himself with his ticket-of-leave ministers and his

Rural ruminants could have dared upon such a deed! And this too in the most classic form; one part of his fortifications in the hands of his Prussian conquerors and protectors. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    When King Bomba<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en49">49</A>]</FONT> tried his hands at Palermo in January 1848, Thiers rose in the Chamber of Deputies: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "You know, gentlemen, what passes at Palermo: you all shock [<I>read</I> shake] with horror" (in the "parliamentary" sense) "when hearing that <I>during 48 hours a great town has been bombarded.</I> By whom? Was it by a foreign enemy, exercising the rights of war? No, gentlemen, by <I>its own government.</I>" 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (If it had been by its own government, under the eyes and on the sufferance of the foreign enemy, all would, of course, have been right.) 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "And why? <I>Because that unfortunate town</I> (city) <I>demanded its rights.</I> Well, then. For the demand of its rights, it has <I>had 48 hours of bombardment.</I>" 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (If the bombardment had lasted 4 weeks and more, all would have been right.) 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Allow me to appeal to the opinion of Europe. It is doing a service to mankind to come and make reverberate from the greatest tribune perhaps of Europe some <I>words of indignation</I> (indeed! words!) against such acts. . . . When the Regent Espartero, who had rendered services to his country (what Thiers never did), <I>in order to suppress an insurrection</I>, wanted to <I>bombard Barcelona</I>, there was from all parts of the world a general shriek of indignation." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Well, about a year later this fine-souled man became the sinister suggester and the most fierce defender (apologist) of the bombardment of Rome by the troops of the French Republic, under the command of the Legitimist Oudinot. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    A few days before the Revolution of February, fretting at the long exile from power to which Guizot had condemned

him, smelling in the air the commotion, Thiers exclaimed again in the Chamber of Deputies: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "<I>I am of the party of Revolution</I>, not only in France, but in Europe. I wish the government of the Revolution to remain in the hands of moderate men. But if that government should pass into the hands of ardent men, even of the Radicals, I should not for all that desert (abandon) my cause. <I>I shall always be of the party of the Revolution.</I>" 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Revolution of February came. Instead of displacing the cabinet [of] Guizot by the cabinet [of] Thiers, as the little man had dreamt, it displaced Louis Philippe by the Republic. To put down that Revolution was M. Thiers' exclusive business from the proclamation of the Republic to the <I>coup d'&eacute;tat.</I> On the first day of the popular victory, he anxiously hid himself, forgetting that the contempt of the people rescued him from its hatred. Still, with his legendary courage, he continued to shy the public stage until after the bloody disruption of the material forces of the Paris proletariat by Cavaignac, the bourgeois Republican. Then the scene was cleared for his sort of action. His hour had again struck. He became the leading mind of the "<I>Party of Order </I>" and its "<I>Parliamentary Republic</I>," that anonymous reign in which all the rival factions of the ruling classes conspired together to crush the working class and conspired against each other, each for the restoration of its own monarchy. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    (The Restoration had been the reign of aristocratic landed proprietors, the July Monarchy the reign of the capitalist, Cavaignac's republic the reign of the "Republican" fraction of the bourgeoisie, while during all these reigns the band of hungry adventurers forming the Bonapartist party had panted in vain for the plunder of France, that was to qualify them as the saviours of "order and property, family and religion." 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 221</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  That Republic was the anonymous reign of the coalesced Legitimists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists with the bourgeois Republicans for their tail.)

</CENTER>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  If this Rural Assembly, meeting at Bordeaux, made this government, the "Government of Defence men" had before hand taken good care to make that Assembly. For that purpose they had dispatched Thiers on a travelling tour through the provinces, there to foreshadow coming events and make ready for the surprise of the general elections. Thiers had to overcome one difficulty. Quite apart from having become an abomination to the French people, the Bonapartists, if numerously elected, would at once have restored the Empire and <I>embaled </I>* M. Thiers and Co. for a voyage to Cayenne. The Orleanists were too sparsely scattered to fill their own places and those vacated by the Bonapartists. To galvanize the Legitimist party had therefore become unavoidable. Thiers was not afraid of his task. [The Legitimists were] impossible as a government of modern France, and therefore contemptible as rivals for place and pelf; who could be fitter to be handled as the blind tool of counter-revolution than the party whose action, in the words of Thiers, had always been confined to the three resources of "foreign invasion, civil war, and anarchy"? (<I>Speech of Thiers at the Chamber of Deputies of January 5, 1833.</I>) A select set of the Legitimists, expropriated by the Revolution of 1789, had regained their estates by enlisting in the servant hall of the first Napoleon, [but] the bulk of them, by the

milliard of indemnity and the private donations of the Restoration. Even their seclusion from participation in active politics under the successive reigns of Louis Philippe and Napoleon the Little served as a lever to the re-establishment of their wealth, as landed proprietors. Freed from court and representation costs at Paris, they had, out of the very corners of provincial France, only to gather the golden apples falling into their <I>Ch&acirc;teaux</I> from the tree of modern industry, railways enhancing the price of their land, agronomy applied to it by capitalist farmers, increasing its produce, and the inexhaustible demand of a rapidly swollen town population securing the growth of markets for that produce. The very same social agencies which reconstituted their material wealth and remade their importance as partners of that joint-stock company of modern slaveholders, screened them from the infection of the modern ideas and allowed them, in rustic innocence, nothing to forget and nothing to learn. Such people furnished the mere passive material to be worked upon by a man like Thiers. While executing the mission entrusted to him by the Government of Defence, the mischievous imp overreached his mandataries in securing to himself that multitude of elections which was to convert the Defence men from his opponent masters into his avowed servants. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The electoral traps being thus laid, the French people was suddenly summoned by the <I>capitulards</I> of Paris to choose, within 8 days, a National Assembly, with the exclusive task, by virtue of the terms of the convention of the 31st January, dictated by Bismarck, to decide on war or peace. Quite apart [from] the extraordinary circumstances, under which that election occurred, with no time for deliberation, with one half of France under the sway of Prussian bayonets, with its other half secretly worked upon by the government intrigue, with 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 223</B></FONT><P>

Paris secluded from the provinces, the French people felt instinctively that the very terms of the armistice, undergone by the <I>capitulards</I> left France no choice (alternative) but that of a peace <I>&agrave; outrance</I> [at any price], and that for its sanction the worst men of France would be the best. Hence the Rural Assembly emerging at Bordeaux. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Still we must distinguish between the old <I>r&eacute;gime</I> orgies and the real historical business of the Rurals. Astonished to find themselves the strongest fraction of an immense majority composed of themselves and the Orleanists, with a contingent of bourgeois Republicans and a mere sprinkling of Bonapartists, they vainly believed in the long expected advent of their retrospective millennium. There were the heels of the foreign invasion, trampling upon France, there was the downfall of the Empire and the captivity of a Bonaparte, and there they were themselves. The wheel of history had evidently turned round to stop at the <I>Chambre introuvable</I> of 1816, with its deep and impassionate curses against the revolutionary deluge and its abominations, with its "decapitation and decapitalization of Paris," its "decentralization" breaking through the network of State rule by the local influences of the <I>Ch&acirc;teaux</I> and its religious homilies and its tenets of antediluvian politics, with [its] <I>gentilhommerie</I> [gentility], flippancy, its genealogic spite against the drudging masses, and its Oeil-de-Boeuf<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> views of the world. Still in point of fact they had only to act their part as joint-stock holders of the "Party of Order," as monopolists of the means of production. From 1848 to 1851, they had only to form a fraction of the interregnum of the "Parliamentary

porizing circumspect manner, but as a clause of the urgent financial treaty with its irresistible fascinations, it brooked no delay. Thiers had therefore to try his hands at a <I>coup d'&eacute;tat.</I> He opened the civil war by sending Vinoy, the <I>D&eacute;cembriseur</I>, at the head of a multitude of <I>sergents de ville</I> and a few regiments of the line, upon the nocturnal expedition against the buttes Montmartre. His felonious attempt having broken down on the resistance of the National Guards and their fraternization with the soldiers, on the following day, in a manifesto stuck to the walls of Paris, Thiers told the National Guards of his magnanimous resolve to leave them their arms, with which he felt sure they would be eager to rally round the Government against "the rebels." Out of 300,000 National Guards only 300 responded to his summons. The glorious workmen's Revolution of the 18th March had taken undisputed possession (sway) of Paris. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Central Committee, which directed the defence of Montmartre and emerged on the dawn of the 18th March as the leader of the Revolution, was neither an expedient of the moment nor the offspring of secret conspiracy. From the very day of the capitulation, by which the Government of National Defence had disarmed France but reserved to itself a bodyguard of 40,000 troops for the purpose of cowing Paris, Paris stood on the watch. The National Guard reformed its organization and entrusted its supreme control to a Central Committee, consisting of the delegates of the single companies, mostly workmen, with their main strength in the workmen's suburbs, but soon accepted by the whole body save its old Bonapartist formations. On the eve of the entrance of the Prussians into Paris, the Central Committee took measures for the removal to Montmartre, Belleville, and La Villette, of the cannon and <I>mitrailleuses</I> treacherously abandoned by the 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 226</B></FONT><P>

<I>capitulards</I> even in those quarters which the Prussians were about to occupy. It thus made safe of the artillery, furnished by the subscriptions of the National Guard, officially recognized as their private property in the convention of the 31st of January, and on that very title exempted from the general surrender of arms. During the whole interval from the meeting of the National Assembly at Bordeaux to the 18th of March, the Central Committee had been the people's government of the capital, strong enough to persist in its firm attitude of defence despite the provocations of the Assembly, the violent measures of the Executive, and the menacing concentration of troops. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   (The Revolution of the 4th of September had restored the Republic. The tenacious resistance of Paris during the siege, serving as the basis of a war of defence in the provinces, had wrung from the foreign invader the recognition of the Republic. Its true meaning and purpose were only revealed by the Revolution of the 18th March and that revelation was a Revolution. It was to supersede the social and political conditions of class rule which had engendered the Second Empire, and in their turn ripened under its tutelage into rottenness. Europe thrilled as under an electric shock. It seemed for a moment to doubt whether, in its recent sensational performances of State and war there was any reality and whether they were not the mere hallucination of a long bygone past, upon which the old world system rests.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The defeat of Vinoy by the National Guard was but a check given to the counter-revolution plotted by the ruling classes, but the Paris people turned at once that incident of their self-defence into the first act of a Social Revolution. The Revolution of the 4th September had restored the Republic after the throne of the usurper had become vacant. The tenacious re-

It was to supersede the social and political conditions of class rule, upon which the old world's system rests, which had engendered the Second Empire and under its tutelage, ripened into rottenness.

   But the horrid "atrocities" that have sullied this Revolution? 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   So far as these atrocities imputed to them by their enemies are not the deliberate calumny of Versailles or the horrid spawn of the penny-a-liner's brain, they relate only to two facts -- the execution of the Generals Lecomte and Cl&eacute;ment Thomas and the Vend&ocirc;me Affair, of which we shall dispose in a few words. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   One of the paid cut-throats selected for the (felonious handiwork) execution of the nocturnal coup de main on Mont-

martre, General Lecomte had on the Place Pigalles four times ordered his troops of the 81st of the line to charge an unarmed gathering, and on their refusal fiercely insulted them. Instead of shooting women and children, some of his own men shot him, when taken prisoner in the afternoon of the 18th March, in the gardens of the Ch&acirc;teau-Rouge. The inveterate habits acquired by the French <I>soldatesca</I> under the training of the enemies of the working class, are of course not likely to change the very moment they change sides. The same soldiers executed Cl&eacute;ment Thomas. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "General" Cl&eacute;ment Thomas, a discontent ex-quartermaster sergeant had, in the latter times of Louis Philippe's reign, enlisted in the "Republican" <I>National</I> newspaper, there to serve in the double quality of straw man (responsible <I>g&eacute;rant </I>) and bully. The men of the <I>National</I>, having abused the February Revolution, to cheat themselves into power, metamorphosed their old quartermaster-sergeant into a "General" on the eve of the butchery of June, of which he, like Jules Favre, was one of the sinister plotters and became one of the most merciless executors. Then his generalship came to a sudden end. He disappeared only to rise again to the surface on the 1st November 1870. The day before, the Government of Defence, caught at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, had upon their word of honour, solemnly bound themselves to Blanqui, Flourens and the other representatives of the working class to abdicate their usurped power into the hands of a Commune to be freely chosen by Paris. They broke, of course, their word of honour, to let loose the Bretons of Trochu, who had taken the place of the Corsicans of Louis Bonaparte, upon the people guilty of believing in their honour. M. Tamisier alone refusing to sully his name by such a breach of faith, tendering at once his resignation of the commander ship-in-chief of the National Guard, "General" Cl&eacute;ment 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 229</B></FONT><P>

Thomas was shuffled into his place. During his whole tenure of office he made war not upon the Prussians, but upon the Paris National Guard, proving inexhaustible in pretexts to prevent their [<I>read</I> its] general armament, in devices of disorganization by pitching its bourgeois elements against its working men's elements, of weeding out the officers hostile to Trochu's "plan" and disbanding under the stigma of cowardice the very proletarian <I>bataillons</I> whose heroism is now astonishing their most inveterate enemies. Cl&eacute;ment Thomas felt proud of having reconquered his June pre-eminence as the personal enemy of the Paris working class. Only a few days before the 18th of March he laid before the War Minister Le Fl&ocirc; a plan of his own for finishing off "<I>la fine fleur</I> (the cream) of the Paris <I>canaille. </I>" As if haunted by the June spectres, he must needs appear, in the quality of an <I>amateur detecteur</I> [detective], on the scene of action after Vinoy's rout! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Central Commune<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> tried in vain to rescue these two criminals Lecomte and Cl&eacute;ment Thomas from the soldiers' wild Lynch justice, of which they themselves and the Paris workmen were as guilty as the Princess Alexandra of the people crushed to death on the day of her entrance in London. Jules Favre with his forged pathos, flung his curses upon Paris, the den of assassins. The Rural Assembly mimicked hysterical contortions of "<I>sensiblerie </I>" [sentimentality]. These men never shed their crocodile tears but as a pretext for shedding the blood of the people. To handle respectable cadavers as weapons of civil war has always been a favourite trick with the Party of Order.

surgents of June, while they were fully aware from the evidence of an eyewitness, M. Jaquemet, the Archbishop's vicar, that the Bishop had been shot by Cavaignac's own soldiers! Through the letters to Thiers of the present Archbishop of Paris,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp230">*</A>]</FONT> a man with no martyr's vein in him, there runs the shrewd suspicion that his Versailles friends were quite the men to console themselves of his prospective execution in the violent desire to fix that amiable proceeding on the Commune! However, when the cry of "assassins" had served its turn, Thiers coolly disposed of it by declaring from the tribune of the National Assembly, that the "assassination" was the private deed of a "very few" obscure individuals. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The "men of Order," the reactionists of Paris, trembling at the people's victory as the signal of retribution, were quite astonished by proceedings, strangely at variance with their own traditional methods of celebrating a defeat of the people. Even the <I>sergents de ville</I>, instead of being disarmed and locked up, had the doors of Paris flung wide open for their safe retreat to Versailles, while the "men of Order," left not only unhurt, were allowed to rally quietly [and] lay hold on the strongholds in the very centre of Paris. They interpreted, of course, the indulgence of the Central Committee and the magnanimity of the armed workmen, as mere symptoms of conscious weakness. Hence their plan to try under the mask of an "unarmed" demonstration the work which four days before Vinoy's cannon and <I>mitrailleuses</I> had failed in. Starting from the quarters of luxury, a riotous mob of "gentlemen" with all the "<I>petits crev&eacute;s </I>" [dandies] in their ranks and the familiars of the Empire, the Heeckeren, Cotlogon, H. de P&egrave;ne, etc., at their head fell in marching order under the cries of "Down with

the Assassins! Down with the Central Committee! Vive l'Assembl&eacute;e nationale!", ill-treating and disarming the detached posts of National Guards they met with on their progress. When then at last debouching in[to] the Place Vend&ocirc;me, they tried, under shouts of ribald insults, to dislodge the National Guards from their headquarters, forcibly break through the lines. In answer to their pistol-shots the regular <I>sommations</I> (the French equivalent of the English reading of the Riot Act) were made, but proved ineffective to stop the aggressors. Then fire was commanded by the general of the National Guard<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp231">*</A>]</FONT> and these rioters dispersed in wild flight. Two National Guards killed, eight dangerously wounded and the streets, through which they [the rioters] disbanded, strewn with revolvers, daggers and cane-swords, gave clear evidence of the "unarmed" character of their "pacific" demonstration. When, on the 13th June 1849, the National Guards of Paris made a really "unarmed" demonstration of protest against the felonious assault on Rome by French troops, Changarnier, the general of the "Party of Order" had their ranks sabred, trampled down by cavalry, and shot down. The state of siege was at once proclaimed, new arrests, new proscriptions, a new reign of terror set in. But the "lower orders" manage these things otherwise. The runaways of the 22nd March, being neither followed nor harassed on their flight, nor afterwards called to account by the judge of instruction (<I>juge d'instruction </I>), were able two days later to muster again an "armed" demonstration under Admiral Saisset. Even after the grotesque failure of this their second rising they were, like all other Paris citizens, allowed to try their hands at the ballot-box for the election of the Com-

mune. When succumbing in this bloodless battle, they at last purged Paris from their presence by an unmolested exodus dragging along with them the <I>cocottes</I>, the <I>lazzaroni</I> and the other dangerous class[es] of the capital. The assassination of the "unarmed citizens" on the 22nd of March is a myth which even Thiers and his Rurals have never dared to harp upon entrusting it exclusively to the servants' hall of European journalism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If there is to be found fault with in the conduct of the Central Committee and the Paris workmen towards these "men of Order" from 18th March to the time of their exodus, it is an excess of moderation bordering upon weakness.

  Look now to the other side of the medal! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   After the failure of their nocturnal surprise of Montmartre, the Party of Order began their regular campaign against Paris in the commencement of April. For inaugurating the civil war by the methods of December, the massacre in cold blood of the captured soldiers of the line and infamous murder of our brave friend Duval, Vinoy, the runaway, is appointed by Thiers Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour! Galliffet, the fancy man of that woman so notorious for her shameless masquerades at the orgies of the Second Empire, boasts in an official manifesto of the cowardly assassination of Paris National Guards with their lieutenant and their captain made by surprise and treason. Desmar&ecirc;t, the gendarme, is decorated for his butchery-like chopping of the high-souled and chivalrous Flourens, the encouraging particulars of whose death are triumphantly communicated to the Assembly of Thiers. In the horribly grotesque exultation of a Tom Pouce playing the part of Timur Tamerlane, Thiers denies the "rebels" against his 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 233</B></FONT><P>

littleness all the rights and customs of civilized warfare, even the right of "ambulances." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When the Commune had published on the 7 April the decree of reprisals, declaring it its duty to protect itself against the cannibal exploits of the Versailles banditti and to demand an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, the atrocious treatment of the Versailles prisoners, of whom Thiers says in one of his bulletins, "never had more degraded countenances of a degraded democracy met the afflicted gazes of honest men," did not cease, but the fusillades of the captives were stopped. Hardly, however, had he and his Decembrist general become aware, that the Commune's decree was but an empty threat, that even their spying gendarmes caught in Paris under the disguise of National Guards, that even their <I>sergents de ville</I> captured with explosive bombs upon them were spared, when at once the old <I>r&eacute;gime</I> set in again wholesale, and has continued to this day. The National Guards who had surrendered at Belle-Epine to an overwhelming force of Chasseurs were then shot down one after the other by the captain of the <I>peloton</I> [platoon] on horseback; houses to which Parisian troops and National Guards had fled, [were] surrounded by gendarmes, inundated with petroleum, and then set on fire, the calcinated corpses being afterwards transported by Paris ambulance; the bayoneting of the National Guards surprised by treason in their beds at the redoubt of Moulin-Saquet (the Federals surprised in their beds asleep), the massacre (fusillade) of Clamart, prisoners wearing the line uniform shot off-hand, -- all these high deeds flippantly told in Thiers' bulletin are only a few incidents of this slaveholders' rebellion! But would it not be ludicrous to quote single facts of ferocity in view of this civil war, fermented amidst the ruins of France, by the conspirators of Versailles, from the meanest motives of class interest, and [in 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 234</B></FONT><P>

view of] the bombardment of Paris under the patronage of Bismarck, in the sight of his soldiers! The flippant manner in which Thiers reports on these things in the bulletin has even shocked the not over-sensitive nerves of the <I>Times.</I> All this is, however, "regular" as the Spaniards say. The fights of the ruling classes against the producing classes menacing their privileges, are full of the same horrors, although none exhibits such an excess of tenacity on the part of the oppressed and bear such an abasement. . . .<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp234">*</A>]</FONT> Theirs has always been the old axiom of knight-errantry that every weapon is fair if used against the plebeian.

   The affair at Belle-Epine, near Villejuif [was like] this: On the 25th April four National Guards [were] being surrounded by a troop of mounted Chasseurs, who bid them to surrender and lay down their arms. Unable to resist, they obeyed and were left unhurt by the Chasseurs. Some time later their captain, a worthy officer of Galliffet's, arrived in full gallop and shot the prisoners down with his revolver, one after the other, and then trotted off with his troop. Three of the guards were dead, one, named Scheffer, grievously wounded, survived, and was afterwards brought to the Hospital of Bic&ecirc;tre. Thither the Commune sent a commission to take up the evidence of

  The Commune had, after Sedan, been proclaimed by the workmen of Lyons, Marseilles and Toulouse. Gambetta did his best to destroy it.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en154">154</A>]</FONT> During the siege of Paris the ever recurrent workmen's commotions, again and again crushed on false pretences by Trochu's Bretons, those worthy substitutes of Louis Bonaparte's Corsicans, were as many attempts to dislodge the government of impostors by the Commune. The Commune then silently elaborated was the true secret of the Revolution of the 4th of September. Hence, on the very dawn of the 18th March, after the rout of the counter-revolution, drowsy Europe started up from its dreaming under the Paris thunderbursts of "<I>Vive la Commune! </I>" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What is the Commune, this sphinx so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind?

   In its most simple conception [it is] the form under which the working class assume the political power in their social strongholds, Paris and the other centres of industry.

   "The proletarians of the capital," said the Central Committee in its proclamation of the 20 March, "have, in the midst of the failures and treason of the ruling classes, understood that for them the hour had struck to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of public affairs. . . . They have understood that it was their imperious duty and their absolute right to take into their own hands their own destiny by seizing upon the political power (State power)."<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en73">73</A>]</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp 
   But the proletariat cannot, as the ruling classes and their different rival fractions have done in the successive hours of their triumph, simply lay hold on the existent State body and wield this ready-made agency for their own purpose. The first condition for the hold[ing] of political power, is to transform [the] working machinery and destroy it -- an instrument of class rule. That huge governmental machinery, entoiling like a boa constrictor the real social body in the ubiquitous meshes of a standing army, hierarchical bureaucracy, an obedient police, clergy and a servile magistrature, was first forged in the days of absolute monarchy as a weapon of nascent middle-class society in its struggles of emancipation from feudalism. The first French Revolution with its task to give full scope to the free development of modern middle-class society had to sweep away all the local, territorial, townish and provincial strongholds of feudalism, prepared the social soil for the superstructure of a centralized State power, with omnipresent organs ramified after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labour.

    But the working class cannot simply lay hold on the ready made State machinery and wield it for their own purpose. The political instrument of their enslavement cannot serve as the political instrument of their emancipation.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The modern bourgeois State is embodied in two great organs, parliament and the government. Parliamentary omnipotence had, during the period of the Party of Order Republic, from 1848 to 1851, engendered its own negative -- the Second Empire -- and imperialism, with its mere mockery of parliament, is the <I>r&eacute;gime</I> now flourishing in most of the great military States of the continent. At first view, apparently, the usurpatory dictatorship of the governmental body over society itself, rising alike above and humbling alike all classes; it has in fact, on the European continent at least, become the only possible State form in which the appropriating class can continue to sway it over the producing class. The assembly of the ghosts of all the defunct French parliaments which still haunts Versailles wields no real force save the governmental machinery as shaped by the Second Empire.   The huge governmental parasite, entoiling the social body like a boa constrictor in the ubiquitous meshes of its bureaucracy, police, standing army, clergy and magistrature, dates its birth from the days of absolute monarchy. The centralized State power had at that time to serve nascent middle-class society as a mighty weapon in its struggles of emancipation from feudalism. The French Revolution of the 18th century, with its task to sweep away the medieval rubbish of seigniorial, local, townish and provincial privileges, could not but simultaneously clear the social soil of the last obstacles hampering the full development of a centralized State power, with omnipresent organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labour. Such [<I>read</I> Thus] it burst into life under the First Empire, itself the offspring of the Coalition wars of old semi-feudal Europe against modern France. During the subsequent parliamentary <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> of the <I>Restauration</I>, the July Monarchy, and the Party of Order Republic, the supreme 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 238</B></FONT><P>

management of that State machinery with its irresistible allurements of place, pelf and patronage became not only the butt of contest between the rival fractions of the ruling class, but at the same degree that [<I>read</I> as] the economic progress of modern society swelled the ranks of the working class, accumulated its miseries, organized its resistance and developed its tendencies at emancipation, in one word, that [<I>read</I> as] the modern struggle of classes, the struggle between labour and capital, assumed shape and form, the physiognomy and the character of the State power underwent a striking change. It had always been the power for the maintenance of order, i.e., the existing order of society, and therefore, of the subordination and exploitation of the producing class by the appropriating class. But as long as this order was accepted as an uncontrovertible and uncontested necessity, the State power could assume an aspect of impartiality. It kept up the existing subordination of the masses, which was the unalterable order of things and a social fact undergone without contest on the part of the masses, exercised by their "natural superiors" without solicitude. With the entrance of society itself into a new phase, the phase of class struggle, the character of its organized public force, the State power, could not but change also (but also undergo a marked change) and more and more develop its character as the instrument of class despotism, the political engine forcibly perpetuating the social enslavement of the producers of wealth by its appropriators, of the economic rule of capital over labour. After each new popular revolution, resulting in the transfer of the direction of the State machinery from one set of the ruling classes to another, the repressive character of the State power was more fully developed and more mercilessly used, because the promises made, and seemingly assured by the Revolution, could only be broken by the employment of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 239</B></FONT><P>

force. Besides, the change worked by the successive revolutions sanctioned only politically the social fact, the growing power of capital, and, therefore, transferred the State power itself more and more directly into the hands of the direct antagonists of the working class. Thus the Revolution of July transferred the power from the hands of the landowners into those of the great manufacturers (the great capitalists), and the Revolution of February into those of the united fractions of the ruling class, united in their antagonism to the working class, united as "the Party of Order," the order of their own class rule. During the period of the Parliamentary Republic the State power became at last the avowed instrument of war, wielded by the appropriating class against the productive mass of the people. But as an avowed instrument of civil war, it could only be wielded during a time of civil war, and the condition of life for the Parliamentary Republic was, therefore, the continuance of openly-declared civil war, the negative of that very "order" in the name of which the civil war was waged. This could only be a spasmodic, exceptional state of things. It was impossible as the normal political form of society, unbearable even to the mass of the middle classes. When therefore all elements of popular resistance were broken down, the Parliamentary Republic had to disappear before (give way to) the Second Empire. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Empire -- professing to rest upon the producing majority of the nation, the peasants, [who stayed] apparently out of the range of the class struggle between capital and labour (indifferent and hostile to both the contesting social powers), wielding the State power as a force superior to the ruling and ruled classes, imposing upon both an armistice (silencing the political, and therefore revolutionary form of the class struggle), divesting the State power from its direct form of class 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 240</B></FONT><P>

despotism by braking the parliamentary, and therefore directly political power of the appropriating classes -- was the only possible State form to secure the old social order a respite of life. It was, therefore, acclaimed throughout the world as the "saviour of order" and the object of admiration during<A NAME="p240"> 20 years on the part of the would-be slaveholders all over the world. Under its sway, coincident with the change brought upon the market of the world by California, Australia,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en174">174</A>]</FONT> and the wonderful development of the United States, an unsurpassed period of industrial activity set [in], an orgy of stock-jobbery, finance swindlings, joint-stock company adventure -- leading all to rapid centralization of capital by the expropriation of the middle class and widening the gulf between the capitalist class and the working class. The whole turpitude of the capitalist <I>r&eacute;gime</I>, given full scope to its innate tendency, broke loose unfettered. At the same time, an orgy of luxurious debauch, meretricious splendour, a pandemonium of all the low passions of the higher classes. This ultimate form of the governmental power was at the same time its most prostitute, shameless plunder of the State resources by a band of adventurers, hotbed of huge State debts, the glory of prostitution, a fictitious life of false pretences. The governmental power with all its tinsel covering from top to bottom immerged in mud. The maturity of rottenness of the State machinery itself, and the putrescence of the whole social body, flourishing under it, were laid bare by the bayonets of Prussia, herself only eager to transfer the European seat of that <I>r&eacute;gime</I> of gold, blood, and mud from Paris to Berlin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This was the State power in its ultimate and most prostitute shape, in its supreme and basest reality, which the Paris working class had to overcome, and of which this class alone 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 241</B></FONT><P>

could rid society. As to parliamentarism, it had been killed by its own charges<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#fnp241">*</A>]</FONT> and by the Empire. All the working class had to do was not to revive it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   What the workmen had to break down was not a more or less incomplete form of the governmental power of old society; it was that power itself in its ultimate and exhausting shape, the <I>Empire.</I> The direct opposite to the <I>Empire</I> was the <I>Commune.</I> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In its most simple conception the Commune meant the preliminary destruction of the old governmental machinery at its central seats, Paris and the other great cities of France, and its superseding by real self-government which in Paris and the great cities, the social strongholds of the working class, was the government of the working class. Through the siege Paris had got rid of the army which was replaced by a National Guard, with its bulk formed by the workmen of Paris. It was only due to this state of things, that the rising of the 18th of March had become possible. This fact was to become an institution, and the National Guard of the great cities, the people armed against governmental usurpation, to supplant the standing army defending the government against the people. The Commune [was] to consist of the municipal councillors of the different <I>arrondissements</I> (as Paris was the initiator and the model, we have to refer to it), chosen by the suffrage of all citizens, responsible, and revocable in short terms. The majority of that body would naturally consist of workmen or acknowledged representatives of the working class. It was to be a working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the same time. The police agents, instead of being the agents of a central government, were to be the servants of the Com-

mune, having, like the functionaries in all the other departments of administration, to be appointed and always revocable by the Commune; all the functionaries, like the members of the Commune itself, having to do their work at workmen's wages. The judges were also to be elected, revocable, and responsible. The initiative in all matters of social life to be reserved to the Commune. In one word, all public functions, even the few ones that would belong to the Central Government, were to be executed by Communal agents, and, therefore, under the control of the Commune. It is one of the absurdities to say that the Central functions, not of governmental authority over the people, but necessitated by the general and common wants of the country, would become impossible. These functions would exist, but the functionaries themselves could not, as in the old governmental machinery, raise themselves over real society, because the functions were to be executed by <I>Communal agents</I>, and, therefore, always under real control. The public functions would cease to be a private property bestowed by a central government upon its tools. With the standing army and the governmental police, the physical force of repression was to be broken. By the disestablishment of all churches as proprietary bodies and the banishment of religious instruction from all public schools (together with [the introduction of] gratuitous instruction) into the recesses of private life, there to live upon the alms of the faithful, [and by] the divestment of all educational institutes from governmental patronage and servitude, the mental force of repression was to be broken, [and] science made not only accessible to all, but freed from the fetters of government pressure and class prejudice. The municipal taxation to be determined and levied by the Commune, the taxation for general State purposes to be levied by 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 243</B></FONT><P>

Communal functionaries, and disbursed by the Commune itself for the general purposes (its disbursement for the general purposes to be supervised by the Commune itself). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The governmental force of repression and authority over society was thus to be broken in its merely repressive organs, and where it had legitimate functions to fulfil, these functions were not to be exercised by a body superior to the society, but by the responsible agents of society itself.

  To [the] fighting, working, thinking Paris, electrified by the enthusiasm of historic initiative, full of heroic reality, the new society in its throes, there is opposed at Versailles the old society, a world of antiquated shams and accumulated lies. Its true representation is that Rural Assembly, peopled with the gibberish ghouls of all the defunct <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> into [<I>read</I> in] which class rule had successively embodied itself in France, at their head a senile mountebank of parliamentarism, their sword in the hands of the imperialist <I>capitulards</I>, bombarding Paris under the eyes of their Prussian conquerors.

   The immense ruins which the Second Empire, in its fall, has heaped upon France, are for them only an opportunity to dig out and throw to the surface the rubbish of former ruins, of Legitimacy or Orleanism.

they breathe is the sepulchral exhalation of all bygone emigrations.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   There is nothing real about them but their common conspiracy against life, their egotism of class interest, their wish to feed upon the carcass of French society, their common slaveholders' interests, their hatred of the present, and their war upon Paris. 
<A NAME="p244">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Everything about them is a caricature, from that old fossil of Louis Philippe's <I>r&eacute;gime</I>, Count Jaubert, exclaiming in the National Assembly, in the palace of Louis XIV, "We are the State" ("The State, that is ourselves"),<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en175">175</A>]</FONT> (they are in fact the State spectre in its secession from society), and [<I>read</I> to] the Republican fawners upon Thiers holding their <I>r&eacute;unions</I> [meetings] in the <I>Jeu de Paume</I> (Tennis Court) to show their degeneracy from their predecessors in 1789. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thiers at the head, the bulk of the majority split into these two groups of Legitimists and Orleanists, in the tail the Republicans of [the] "old style." Each of these fractions intrigues for a restoration of its own, the Republicans for that of the Parliamentary Republic -- building their hopes upon the senile vanity of Thiers, forming in the meantime [the] Republican decoration of his rule and sanctioning by their presence the war of the Bonapartist generals upon Paris, after having tried to coax it into the arms of Thiers and to disarm it under Saisset! Knights of the sad figure, the humiliations they voluntarily bear with, [show] what Republicanism, as a special form of class rule, has come down to. It was in view of them that Thiers said to the assembled <I>maires</I> of the Seine and Oise: What could they more want? "Was not he, a simple citizen, at the head of the State?" Progress from 1830 to 1870 [shows] that then Louis Philippe was the best of Republics, and that now 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 245</B></FONT><P>

Louis Philippe's Minister, little Thiers himself, is the best of Republics. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Being forced to do their real work -- the war against Paris -- through the imperialist soldiers, gendarmes, and police, under the sway of the retired Bonapartist generals, they tremble in their shoes at the suspicion that -- as during their regime of 1848-51 -- they are only forging the instrument for a second restoration of the Empire. The Pontifical Zouaves and the <I>Vend&eacute;ens</I> of Cathelineau and the Bretons of Charette are in fact their "parliamentary" army, the mere phantasms of an army compared with the imperial reality. While fuming with rage at the very name of the Republic, they accept Bismarck's dictates in its name, waste in its name the rest of French wealth upon the civil war, denounce Paris in its name, forge laws of prospective proscription against the rebels in its name, usurp dictation over France in its name. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Their title [is] the general suffrage, which they had always opposed during their own regimes from 1815 to 1848, [and] abolished in May 1850, after it had been established against them by the Republic, and which they now accept as the prostitute of the Empire, forgetting that with it they accept the Empire of the plebiscites! They themselves are impossible even with the general suffrage. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   They reproach Paris to revolt [<I>read</I> for revolting] against national unity, and their first word was the <I>decapitation</I> of that unity by the decapitalization of Paris. Paris has done the thing they pretended to want, but it has done it, not as they wanted it, as a reactionary dream of the past, but as the revolutionary vindication of the future. Thiers, the Chauvin, threatens since the 18th March Paris with the "intervention of Prussia," stood at Bordeaux for the "intervention of Prussia," acts against Paris in fact only by the means accorded to him 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 246</B></FONT><P>

by Prussia. The Bourbons were dignity itself, compared to this mountebank of chauvinism. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Whatever may be the name -- in case they are victorious -- of their Restoration, with whatever successful pretender at its head, its reality can only be the Empire, the ultimate and indispensable political form of the rule of their rotten classes. If they succeed to restore it, and they must restore it with any of their plans of restoration successful -- they succeed only to accelerate the putrefaction of the old society they represent and the maturity of the new one they combat. Their dim eyes see only the political outwork of the defunct <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> and they dream of reviving them by placing a Henry the 5th or the Count of Paris at their head. They do not see that the social bodies which bore these political superstructures have withered away, that these <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> were only possible under now outgrown conditions and past phases of French society, and that it can only yet bear with imperialism, in its putrescent state, and the Republic of Labour in its state of regeneration. They do not see that the cycles of political forms were only the political expression of the real changes society underwent. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Prussians, who in coarse war exultation of triumph look at the agonies of French society and exploit them with the sordid calculation of a Shylock, and the flippant coarseness of the [. . . ? . . .],<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> are themselves already punished by the transplantation of the Empire to the German soil. They themselves are doomed to set free in France the subterranean agencies which will engulf them with the old order of things. The Paris Commune may fall, but the Social Revolution it has initiated, will triumph. Its birth-stead is everywhere.

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The immense sham of that Versailles, its lying character could not better be embodied and r&eacute;sum&eacute;ed than in Thiers, the professional liar, for whom the "reality of things" exists only in their "parliamentary sense," that is, as a lie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   In his answer to the Archbishop's letter he coolly denies "the pretended executions and <I>reprisals</I> (!) attributed to the troops of Versailles," and has this impudent lie confirmed by a commission appointed for this very purpose by his Rurals. He knows of course their triumphant proclamations by the Bonapartist generals themselves. But in "the parliamentary sense" of the word they do not exist. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   <I>In his circular of the 16th April on the bombardment of Paris </I>: 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "If some cannon-shots have been fired, it is not the deed of the army of Versailles, but of some insurgents <I>wanting to make believe that they are fighting</I>, while they do not dare show themselves." 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Of course, Paris bombards itself, in order to make the world believe that it fights! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Later: "<I>Notre artillerie ne bombarde pas: elle canonne, il est vrai. </I>" ["<I>Our artillery does not bombard: it's true it shells. </I>"] 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    <I>Thiers' bulletin on Moulin-Saquet</I> (<I>4 May </I>): "<I>D&eacute;livrance de Paris des affreux tyrans qui l'oppriment </I>" ["<I>Deliverance of Paris from the dreadful tyrants who oppress it </I>"] (by killing the Paris National Guards asleep). 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The motley lot of an army -- the dregs of the Bonapartist <I>soldatesca</I> released from prison by the grace of Bismarck, with the gendarmes of Valentin and the <I>sergents de ville</I> of Pi&eacute;tri for their nucleus, set off by the Pontifical Zouaves, the <I>Chouans</I> of Charette and the <I>Vend&eacute;ens</I> of Cathelineau, the whole placed 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 248</B></FONT><P>

under the runaway Decembrist generals of capitulation -- he dubs "<I>the finest army France ever possessed. </I>" Of course, if the Prussians quarter still at St. Denis, it is because Thiers wants to frighten them by the sight of that "finest of fine armies." 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If such is the "finest army" -- the Versailles anachronism is "the most liberal and most freely elected assembly that ever existed in France." Thiers caps his eccentricity by telling the <I>maires</I>, etc., that "he is a man, who has never broken his word," of course in the parliamentary sense of word-keeping. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He is the truest of Republicans and (S&eacute;ance vom [sitting of] 27 April): "L'assembl&eacute;e est plus lib&eacute;rale que lui-m&ecirc;me." ["The Assembly is more liberal than he himself."] 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   To the <I>maires </I>: "On peut compter sur ma parole &agrave; laquelle je n'ai jamais manqu&eacute;," ["You may rely upon my word, which I have never broken,"] in an unparliamentary sense, which I have never kept. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "L'assembl&eacute;e est une des plus lib&eacute;rales qu'ait nomm&eacute;e la France." ["The Assembly is one of the most liberal France has elected."] 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   He compares himself with Lincoln and the Parisians with the rebellious slaveholders of the South. The Southerners wanted territorial secession from the United States for the slavery of labour. Paris wants the secession of M. Thiers himself and the interests he represents from power for the emancipation of labour. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The revenge which the Bonapartist generals, the gendarmes and the <I>Chouans</I> wreak upon Paris is a necessity of the class war against labour, but in the little byplay of his bulletins Thiers turns it into a pretext of caricaturing his idol, the first Napoleon, and make himself the laughing-stock of Europe by boldly affirming, that the French army through its war upon 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 249</B></FONT><P>

the Parisians has regained the renown it had lost in the war against the Prussians. The whole war thus appears as mere childplay to give vent to the childish vanity of a dwarf, elated at having to describe <I>his</I> own battles, fought by <I>his</I> own army, under <I>his</I> own secret commandership-in-chief. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And his lies culminate in regard to Paris and the Province. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Paris, which in reality holds in check for two months the finest army France ever possessed, despite the secret help of the Prussians, is in fact only anxious to be delivered from its "atrocious tyrants," by Thiers, and therefore it fights against him, although a mere handful of criminals. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    He does not tire of representing the Commune as a handful of convicts, ticket-of-leave men, scum. Paris fights against him because it wants to be delivered by him from "the <I>affreux</I> [frightful] tyrants that oppress it." And this "handful" of desperadoes holds in check since two months "the finest army that France ever possessed," led by the invincible MacMahon and inspired by the Napoleonic genius of Thiers himself! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The resistance of Paris is no reality, but Thiers' lies about Paris are. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Not content to refute him by its exploits, all the living elements of Paris have spoken to him, but in vain, to dislodge him out of his lying world.

   But the fighting Paris, the real Paris is not <I>his</I> Paris. His Paris is itself a parliamentary lie. "The rich, the idle, the capitalist Paris," the cosmopolitan stew, this is his Paris.

The Paris that showed its courage in the "pacific procession" and Saisset's stampede, that throngs now at Versailles, at Rueil, at St. Denis, at St. Germain-en-Laye, followed by the <I>cocottes</I>, sticking to the "man of family, religion, order," and above all, "of property," the Paris of the lounging classes, the Paris of the <I>francs-fileurs</I>, amusing itself by looking through telescopes at the battles going on, treating the civil war [as] but an agreeable diversion, that is the Paris of M. Thiers, as the Emigration of Coblenz was the France of M. de Calonne and as the Emigration at Versailles is the France of M. Thiers. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    If the Paris, that wants to be delivered of the Commune by Thiers, his Rurals, <I>D&eacute;cembriseurs</I> and gendarmes, is a lie, so is his "Province" which through him and his Rurals wants to be delivered from Paris.

    Before the definitive conclusion at Frankfort of the peace treaty,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en176">176</A>]</FONT> he appealed to the provinces to send their <I>bataillons</I> of National Guards and volunteers to Versailles to fight against 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 251</B></FONT><P>

Paris. The provinces refused point-blank. Only the Bretagne sent a handful of <I>Chouans</I> "fighting under a white flag, every one of them wearing on his breast a Jesus heart in white cloth and shouting: 'Vive le roi!'" Thus is the provincial France listening to his summons so that he was forced to send captive French troops from Bismarck, lay hold on the Pontifical Zouaves (the real armed representatives of <I>his</I> provincial France) and make 20,000 gendarmes and 12,000 <I>sergents de ville</I> the nucleus of his army. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Despite the wall of lies, the intellectual and police blockade, by which he tried to fence off (debar) Paris from the provinces, the provinces, instead of sending him <I>bataillons</I> to wage war upon Paris, inundated him with so many delegations insisting upon peace with Paris, that he refused to receive them any longer in person. The tone of the addresses sent up from the provinces, proposing most of them the immediate conclusion of an armistice with Paris, the dissolution of the Assembly, "because its mandate had expired," and the grant of the municipal rights demanded by Paris, was so offensive that Dufaure denounces them in his "circular against conciliation" to the Prefects. On the other hand, the Rural Assembly and Thiers received not one single address of approval on the part of the provinces. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But the grand <I>d&eacute;fi</I> [challenge] the provinces gave to Thiers' "lie" about the provinces were the municipal elections of the 30 April, carried on under his government, on the basis of a law of his Assembly. Out of 700,000 councillors (in round numbers) returned by the 30,000 communes still left in mutilated France, the united Legitimists, Orleanists and Bonapartists did not carry 8,000! The supplementary elections still more hostile! This showed plainly how far the <I>National Assembly</I>, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 252</B></FONT><P>

chosen by surprise, and on false pretences, represents France, provincial France, France minus Paris! 
<A NAME="p252">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But the plan of an assembly of the municipal delegates of the great provincial towns at Bordeaux, forbidden by Thiers on the ground of his law of 1834 and an imperialist one of 1855,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="CWFdrf71.html#en177">177</A>]</FONT> forced him to avow that his "provinces" are a lie, as "his" Paris is. He accuses them of resembling the "false" Paris, of being eagerly bent upon "laying the fundaments of communism and rebellion." Again he has been answered by the late resolution of the municipal councils of Nantes, Vienne, Chamb&eacute;ry, Limoux, Carcassone, Angers, Carpentras, Montpellier, Privas, Grenoble, etc., asking, insisting upon peace with Paris, 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
"the absolute affirmation of the Republic, the recognition of the Communal right," which, as the <I>municipal council of Vienne says</I>, "the &eacute;lus of the 8. f&eacute;vrier promised dans leur circulaire, lorsqu'ils &eacute;taient candidats. Pour faire cesser la guerre &eacute;trang&egrave;re, elle (I'Assembl&eacute;e nationale) a c&eacute;d&eacute; deux provinces et promis cinq milliards &agrave; la Prusse. Que ne doit-elle pas faire pour mettre fin &agrave; la guerre civile?" ["the elected of February 8 promised in their circular while they were candidates. In order to end the foreign war, it (the National Assembly) ceded two provinces and promised to give Prussia five milliards. What then will it not do to put an end to the civil war?"] 
</FONT>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  (Just the contrary. The two provinces are not their "private" property, and as to the promissory note of 5 milliards, the thing is exactly that it shall be paid by the French people and not by them.) 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   If, therefore, Paris may justly complain of the provinces that they limit themselves to pacific demonstrations, leaving it unaided against all the State forces . . . , the province has in most unequivocal tones given the lie to Thiers and the Assembly to be represented there, has declared their Province a lie as is their whole existence, a sham, a false pretence.

  The General Council feels proud of the prominent part the Paris branches of the <I>International</I> have taken in the glorious revolution of Paris.

   Armed Paris was the only serious obstacle in the way of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Paris was, therefore, to be disarmed. On this point the Bordeaux Assembly was sincerity itself. If the roaring rant of its Rurals had not been audible

enough, the surrender of Paris handed over by Thiers to the tender mercies of the triumvirate of Vinoy, the <I>D&eacute;cembriseur</I>, Valentin, the Bonapartist gendarme, and Aurelle de Paladines, the Jesuit general, would have cut off even the last subterfuge of doubt as to the ultimate aim of the disarmament of Paris. But if their purpose was frankly avowed, the pretext on which these atrocious felons initiated the civil war was the most shameless, the most bare-faced (glaring) of lies. The artillery of the Paris National Guard, said Thiers, belonged to the State, and to the State it must be returned. The fact was this. From the very day of the capitulation by which Bismarck's prisoners had signed the surrender of France but reserved to themselves a numerous bodyguard for the express purpose of cowing Paris, Paris stood on its watch. The National Guard reorganized themselves and entrusted their supreme control to a Central Committee elected by their whole body, save some fragments of the old Bonapartist formations. On the eve of the entrance of the Prussians into Paris, their Central Committee took measures for the removal to Montmartre, Belleville, and La Villette of the cannon and <I>mitrailleuses</I>, treacherously abandoned by the <I>capitulards</I> in the very quarters the Prussians were about to occupy. That artillery had been furnished by the subscriptions of the National Guard. As their private property it was officially recognized in the convention of the 28th January, and on that very title exempted from the general surrender of arms, belonging to the government, into the hands of the conqueror. And Thiers dared initiate the civil war on the mendacious pretext that the artillery of the National Guard was State property! 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The seizure of this artillery was evidently but to serve as the preparatory measure for the general disarmament of the Paris National Guard, and therefore of the Revolution of the 4th of 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 255</B></FONT><P>

September. But that Revolution had become the legal status of France. Its Republic was recognized in the terms of the capitulation itself by the conqueror, it was after the capitulation acknowledged by the foreign powers, in its name the National Assembly had been summoned. The Revolution of the Paris workmen of the 4th of September was the only legal title of the National Assembly seated at Bordeaux and its Executive. Without it, the National Assembly had at once to give room to the <I>Corps l&eacute;gislatif</I>, elected by general suffrage and dispersed by the arm of the Revolution. Thiers and his ticket-of-leave men would have had to capitulate for safe-conducts and securities against a voyage to Cayenne. The National Assembly, with its attorney's power to settle the terms of peace with Prussia, was only an incident of the Revolution. Its true embodiment was armed Paris, that had initiated the Revolution [and] undergone for it a five months' siege with its horrors of famine, that had made its prolonged resistance, despite Trochu's "plan," the basis of a tremendous war of defence in the provinces. And Paris was now summoned with coarse insult by the rebellious slaveholders at Bordeaux to lay down its arms and acknowledge that the popular revolution of the 4th September had had no other purpose but the simple transfer of power from the hands of Louis Bonaparte and his minions in [<I>read</I> to] those of his monarchical rivals, or to stand forward as the self-sacrificing champion of France, to be saved from her ruin and to be regenerated only through the revolutionary overthrow of the political and social conditions that had engendered the Empire and under its fostering care, matured into utter rottenness. Paris, emaciated by a five months' famine, did not hesitate one moment. It heroically resolved to run all the hazards of a resistance against the French conspirators under the very eyes of the Prussian army quartered before 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 256</B></FONT><P>

its gates. But in its utter abhorrence of civil war, the popular government of Paris, the Central Committee of the National Guard, continued to persist in its merely defensive attitude, despite the provocations of the Assembly, the usurpations of the Executive, and the menacing concentration of troops in and around Paris. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    On the dawn of the 18th March Paris arose under thunder bursts of "<I>Vive la Commune! </I>" What is the Commune, that sphinx so tantalizing to the bourgeois mind? 

<FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The proletarians of the capital," said the Central Committee in its manifesto of the 18th March, "have, in the midst of the failures and treasons of the ruling classes, understood that for them the hour has struck to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of public affairs. . . . They have understood that it is their imperious duty and their absolute right to take into their own hands their own destinies by seizing the political power."

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   But the working class cannot, as the rival factions of the appropriating class have done in their hours of triumph, simply lay hold on the ready-made State machinery, and wield it for its own purposes. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    The centralized State power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy and magistrature, organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labour, dates from the days of absolute monarchy when it served nascent middle-class society as a mighty weapon in its struggles for emancipation from feudalism. The French Revolution of the 18th century swept away the rubbish of seigniorial, local, townish and provincial privileges, thus clearing the social soil of its last medieval obstacles to the final superstructure of the State. It received its final shape under the First Empire, the offspring of the Coalition wars of old, semi-feudal Europe against modern France. Under the following 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 257</B></FONT><P>

parliamentary <I>r&eacute;gimes</I>, the hold[ing] of the governmental power, with its irresistible allurements of place, pelf, and patronage, became not only the bone of contention between the rival factions of the ruling classes. Its political character changed simultaneously with the economic changes of society. At the same pace that the progress of industry developed, widened and intensified the class antagonism between capital and labour, the governmental power assumed more and more the character of the national power of capital over labour, of a political force organized to enforce social enslavement, of a mere engine of class despotism. On the heels of every popular revolution, marking a new progressive phase in the march (development) (course) of the struggle of classes (class struggle), the repressive character of the State power comes out more pitiless and more divested of disguise. The Revolution of July, by transferring the management of the State machinery from the landlord to the capitalist, transfers it from the distant to the immediate antagonist of the working men. Hence the State power assumes a more clearly defined attitude of hostility and repression in regard of the working class. The Revolution of February hoists the colours of the "Social Republic," thus proving at its outset that the true meaning of State power is revealed, that its pretence of being the armed force of public welfare, the embodiment of the general interests of societies rising above and keeping in their respective spheres the warring private interests, is exploded, that its secret as an instrument of class despotism is laid open, that the work men do want the Republic, no longer as a political modification of the old system of class rule, but as the revolutionary means of breaking down class rule itself. In view of the menaces of the "Social Republic" the ruling class feel instinctively that the anonymous reign of the Parliamentary Republic can be turned 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 258</B></FONT><P>

into a joint-stock company of their conflicting factions, while the past monarchies by their very title signify the victory of one faction and the defeat of the other, the prevalence of one section's interest of that class over that of the other, land over capital or capital over land. In opposition to the working class the hitherto ruling class, in whatever specific forms it may appropriate the labour of the masses, has one and the same <I>economic</I> interest, to maintain the enslavement of labour and reap its fruits directly as landlord and capitalist, indirectly as the State parasites of the landlord and the capitalist, to enforce that "order" of things which makes the producing multitude, a "vile multitude," serving [<I>read</I> serve] as a mere source of wealth and dominion to their betters. Hence Legitimists, Orleanists, bourgeois Republicans and the Bonapartist adventurers, eager to qualify themselves as defenders of property by first pilfering it, club together and merge into the "<I>Party of Order</I>," the practical upshot of that Revolution made by the proletariat under enthusiastic shouts of the "<I>Social Republic. </I>" The Parliamentary Republic of the Party of Order is not only the reign of terror of the ruling class. The State power becomes in their hand the <I>avowed instrument of the civil war</I> in [the] hand of the capitalist and the landlord, their State parasites, against [the] revolutionary aspirations of the producer. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Under the monarchical <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> the repressive measures and the confessed principles of the day's government are denounced to the people by the fractions of the ruling classes that are out of power; the opposition ranks of the ruling class interest the people in their party feuds by appealing to its own interests, by their attitudes of [<I>read</I> as] tribunes of the people, by the revindication of popular liberties. But in the anonymous reign of the Republic, while amalgamating the modes of repression of old past <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> (taking out of the arsenals of all past <I>r&eacute;gimes</I> 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 259</B></FONT><P>

the arms of repression), and wielding them pitilessly, the different fractions of the ruling class celebrate an orgy of renegation. With cynical effrontery they deny the professions of their past, trample under foot their "so-called" principles, curse the revolutions they have provoked in their name, and curse the name of the Republic itself, although only its anonymous reign is wide enough to admit them into a common crusade against the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus this most cruel is at the same time the most odious and revolting form of class rule. Wielding the State power only as an instrument of civil war, it can only hold it by perpetuating civil war. With parliamentary anarchy at its head, crowned by the uninterrupted intrigues of each of the fractions of the "Order" Party for the restoration of each own pet <I>r&eacute;gime</I>, [and] in open war against the whole body of society out of its own narrow circle, the Party of Order rule becomes the most intolerable rule of disorder. Having, in its war against the mass of the people, broken all its means of resistance and laid it helplessly under the sword of the Executive, the Party of Order itself and its parliamentary <I>r&eacute;gime</I> is warned off the stage by the sword of the Executive. That parliamentary Party of Order republic can therefore only be an interreign. Its natural upshot is <I>imperialism</I>, whatever the number of the Empire. Under the form of imperialism, the State power with the sword for its sceptre, professes to rest upon the peasantry, that large mass of producers apparently outside the class struggle of labour and capital, professes to save the working class by breaking down parliamentarism and therefore the direct subserviency of the State power to the ruling classes, professes to save the ruling classes themselves by subduing the working classes without insulting them, professes, if not public welfare, at least national glory. It is therefore proclaimed as the "saviour of 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 260</B></FONT><P>

order." However galling to the political pride of the ruling class and its State parasites, it proves itself to be the really adequate regime of the bourgeois "order" by giving full scope to all the orgies of its industry, turpitudes of its speculation, and all the meretricious splendours of its life. The State thus seemingly lifted above civil society, becomes at the same time itself the hotbed of all the corruptions of that society. Its own utter rottenness, and the rottenness of the society to be saved of [<I>read</I> by] it, was laid bare by the bayonet of Prussia, but so much is this imperialism the unavoidable political form of "order," that is, the "order" of bourgeois society, that Prussia herself seemed only to reverse<FONT SIZE=-2>[*]</FONT> its central seat at Paris in order to transfer it to Berlin.

   "The Drafts of <I>The Civil War in France </I>" were written by Marx in April and May of 1871. In the first days after the Revolution of March 18, Marx began carefully to study all the material on the event in Paris; he collected cuttings and made numerous extracts from French and English newspapers. In the latter half of April Marx began on the first draft and continued working until about May 10; then he began the second draft of <I>The Civil War in France</I> which he completed by the middle of May. Thereupon, he went on to write the final text and put it in the form of an address of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association. The newspaper cuttings and the extracts he had collected in a notebook during the last week of the Paris Commune were not used in the second draft, but were first used in the text of the address itself. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    Both the first and second drafts were originally written on large sheets of paper. The manuscript of the first draft, the longest one, is apparently preserved intact. It fills both sides of 11 written sheets, or 22 pages, which were numbered by Marx with the exception of pages 6 and 13. The manuscript of the second draft, according to the page numbers marked by 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 282</B></FONT><P>

Marx (not on all the sheets), probably consisted of 13 sheets; 11 sheets are preserved (8 are written on one side only, and 3 on both sides). It is assumed that the missing part of the manuscript is Section 4 of the draft, which precedes the preserved Section 5, "Opening of the Civil War. The 18 March Revolution. Cl&eacute;ment Thomas. Lecomte. The Vend&ocirc;me Affair." The last three pages which bear no page numbers (see pp. 253-260 of this book), are mainly revisions of individual passages in the second draft. The larger part of the manuscripts of the first and second drafts has been crossed out by Marx with perpendicular and slanting lines. Apparently in this way Marx marked those portions which he had already used while working on the final text of <I>The Civil War in France.</I> The only words and sentences not included in the present edition are those which Marx crossed out in the manuscripts with horizontal lines. In the manuscripts of both drafts there are many marginal notes, round and square brackets, and so on, which are marks used by the author in his work. These are not to be found in the present edition. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    When Marx cited or quoted the decrees and proclamations of the Commune, he referred to the date of their promulgation or to the date of their publication in the London press. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The two drafts of <I>The Civil War in France</I> were not published during the lifetime of Marx and Engels, and remained unknown long after their death. Extracts of the first draft appeared for the first time in the Soviet Union, in <I>Pravda</I>, Nos. 72 and 76, published respectively on March 14 and 18, 1933. The complete text of the first and second drafts was first published in the original (English) and in Russian in 1934 in the <I>Archives of Marx and Engels</I>, Vol. III (VIII).

   <I>The Battle of Buzenval</I> (also known as the Battle of Montretout or Mont-Val&eacute;rien) took place on January 19, 1871, four months after Paris had been besieged. It was Trochu's last onslaught from the encircled Paris aimed at thoroughly destroying the forces of the National Guards, dampening their morale and convincing the Parisians and the army that the capital was indefensible. During the onslaught, which was carried out without adequate preparation and the necessary reserve force, the French forces failed to co-ordinate their actions. And though the French army fought bravely, the onslaught was repulsed on all points.

   Under the leadership of Gustave Flourens the Worker's Battalions of the National Guard demonstrated in front of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville of Paris on October 5, 1870, demanding that the Government of National Defence hold elections to the Commune, take measures to strengthen the republic and energetically resist the invading enemy. The government 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 283</B></FONT><P>

rejected these demands and forbade the National Guards to assemble or hold armed demonstrations without instructions. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
   For the uprising of October 31, 1870, see Note 66. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   [Note 66:&nbsp; On October 31, 1870, workers and the revolutionary section of the National Guard in Paris launched an insurrection after receiving news that Metz had capitulated, Le Bourget was lost, and Thiers, by order of the Government of National Defence, had begun negotiations with the Prussians. The insurgents occupied the H&ocirc;tel de Ville and established a revolutionary organ of political power, the Committee of Public Safety, headed by Louis Auguste Blanqui. Under the pressure of the workers, the Government of National Defence promised to resign and hold an election to the Commune on November 1. However, taking advantage of the incomplete organization of the revolutionary forces of Paris and the differences between the leading sections of the insurrection -- the Blanquists and the petty-bourgeois democrats, the Jacobinists -- the government went back on its words, and, with the help of the few battalions of the National Guard which remained on its side, reoccupied the H&ocirc;tel de Ville and regained power.]

   This refers to Charles Cousin-Montauban, a French general who commanded the joint French and British aggressive forces which invaded China in 1860.

   Alarmed by the victory of the democrats and the socialists in the election of March-April 1850, the Party of Order led by Thiers had an election law adopted by the Legislative Assembly on May 31, 1850, which abolished universal suffrage. Under this law -- directed against the workers in town and countryside as well as against the small peasants -- the vote was only given to those who had settled down in one place for three years and paid direct tax. Consequently, the number of voters in France was reduced by nearly three million. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    Soon after the adoption of the election law of 1850 the parliament in creased the yearly salary of the President of the Republic, Louis Bonaparte, from 600,000 to 3,000,000 francs.

   At the end of 1868 the factory owners of Normandy tried to make a considerable cut in the wages of the textile workers in order successfully to compete with English-made goods. This caused a great strike in early 1869 of the textile workers in Sotteville-l&egrave;s-Rouen. The strikers appealed to the International for support and the General Council organized collections for them through the trade unions of London and France. Though the strike was defeated, Marx pointed out in the "Report of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association to the Fourth Annual Congress at Basle": "It enlisted the Norman cotton-workers into the revolutionary army of labour, it gave rise to the birth of trades unions at Rouen, Elboeuf, Darn&eacute;tal, and the environs; and it sealed anew the bond of fraternity between the English and French working classes." (See Marx and Engels, <I>Works</I>, Ger. ed., Vol. XVI, pp. 374-75.)

    An attempt at a revolution by the secret Republican-socialist Society of the Seasons on May 12. 1839, headed by Louis Auguste Blanqui and Armand Barhes, did not rely on the masses and bore a conspiratorial character; the rising was suppressed by the government army and the National Guard. In order to combat the danger of revolution, a new cabinet was formed, which Dufaure joined.

    During a growing political crisis in June 1849 -- caused by the Montagnards' opposition to the President of the Republic, Louis Bonaparte -- the Minister of Interior, Dufaure, proposed the adoption of a series of decrees against the revolutionary section of the National Guard, the democrats and socialists.]

   By <I>the "Union lib&eacute;rale" in 1847</I> Marx is referring to the Progressist-Conservatives who emerged in the French Chamber of Deputies after the 1846 election. The chief representatives of this group were Orleanists like Emile de Girardin, Alexis de Tocqueville and Dufaure. In order to consolidate the July Monarchy the Progressist-Conservatives demanded that the Gizot government extend suffrage and carry out a series of economic reforms in the interest of the big industrial bourgeoisie. They were opposed to Gizot and exposed the discreditable acts of members of his government. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    <I>The Union lib&eacute;rale</I> was a coalition of the bourgeois Republicans, the Orleanists and a section of the Legitimists. It was formed on the basis of common opposition to the Empire during the election of the <I>Corps l&eacute;gislatif</I> in 1863. An attempt was made to form the Union lib&eacute;rale again during the election campaign of 1869, but this failed due to quarrels between the different parties which had joined the Union in 1863. The moderate bourgeois Republicans, such as Jules Favre and Jules Simon, advocated an alliance with the monarchists in 1869 and supported the Orleanist Dufaure as a candidate. However, Dufaure was defeated.

Incorporated into the 1st and the 2nd Loire Army, they fought in the war against Germany. After the war the Legion took part in the suppression of the Paris Commune. Later it was disbanded.

   Marx is referring to the infamous role played by Thiers in suppressing the uprising of April 13-14, 1834, which was against the rule of the July Monarchy. The uprising of the Paris workers, and the petty-bourgeois strata which joined in with them, was led by the Republican secret Society for the Rights of Man. In suppressing the insurrection, countless atrocities were perpetrated by the militarists, including the slaughter of all the dwellers in a house in the Rue Transnonain. Thiers was the chief instigator of the brutal suppression of the democrats both during the uprising and after it was put down.

    Under the provisions of the reactionary <I>Laws of September</I> -- introduced in September 1835 -- the French government restricted the activities of juries and severely inhibited the press by such measures as that which increased the sum of money periodicals had to deposit as a security.

   This refers to the two treaties France was forced to sign with the sixth and the seventh anti-French coalition of Austria, Britain, Prussia and Russia. One was signed in 1814, after the fall of Napoleon's empire, and the other in 1815, after Napoleon's restoration and short-lived rule.

    According to the peace treaty of Paris of May 30, 1814, France lost nearly all the territories conquered during the republic and the First Empire. With the exception of small tracts of territories on her northern, eastern and southeastern borders, she was allowed only to retain her boundaries of January 1, 1792. 

<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;
    The second peace treaty of Paris, concluded on November 20, 1815, further deprived France of her important, strategic strongholds on the northern, eastern and southeastern frontiers, which had been retained by the Paris peace treaty of 1814. To help consolidate the monarchical regime of the restored Bourbon dynasty, French fortresses on the north eastern frontier were to be garrisoned by 150,000 allied troops till the end of 1818.

As a result of this reform, personal dependency of the peasants was abolished, but feudal duties and services were still retained and the peasants could redeem themselves only with the lord's consent. Limited local autonomy was also introduced and the army and the central administrative organs reorganized.

   The defence of Sevastopol, Russia's capture of Turkey's Fort Kars and the defeat suffered by the allied troops at the Baltic Sea enabled Russia to use diplomatic manoeuvres at the Peace Congress of Paris in February-March 1856. Though the Crimean War ended in defeat for Russia, she succeeded in exploiting the conflicts between Britain, Austria and France. As a result, the peace terms were considerably mitigated in that the territories ceded to Turkey were greatly limited, Russia was allowed to retain its rule over the Caucasus, maintain a fleet in the Sea of Azov and build forts along its seacoast. The congress also decided to end Austria's occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia, thus creating great difficulties for Austria's policy of expansion in the Balkans.

The reforms marked an important step in Russia's progress to bourgeois monarchy.

   <I>New York Daily Tribune</I> was an American newspaper published in 1841-1924, first as the organ of the Left wing of the American Whig Party before the mid-fifties and later that of the Republicans. Marx's contributions to the newspaper covered the period between August 1851 and March 1862. In fact, however, Engels wrote most of the articles in this period at Marx's request. During the reactionary period in Europe, Marx and Engels made use of this widely-circulated progressive paper to make a factual exposure of the maladies of capitalist society. During the American civil war, Marx completely severed connections with the paper chiefly because the forces advocating compromise with the slave-owners had increased in the editorial board and the paper had departed from its former progressive stand. Later the paper turned further Right.

   <I>The Laws of Suspects</I> -- passed on February 19, 1858 by the Corps l&eacute;gislatif -- vested the emperor and the government with unlimited authority to mete out punishment to people suspected of being hostile to the Second Empire. Under this law people could be jailed or banished to any part of France or Algeria or even expelled altogether from French territory.

   The petition of the Lyons municipal council presented by deputy Greppo to the National Assembly demanded that the civil war be stopped and that Versailles negotiate peace with Paris. It also proposed to clearly limit the authority of the assembly and the Paris Commune and restrict the Commune's activities within the area of municipal questions.

the bourgeois Republicans who were afraid of the resurgence of a monarchy after the defeat of the Paris Commune. Its provisional committee, with the active participation of the Ligue de l'Union r&eacute;publicaine pour les droits de Paris, decided to hold a congress of delegates of the municipal councils at Bordeaux on May 9, 1871, to find ways to end the civil war, consolidate the republic and formally establish the League. After the Versailles government banned the convening of the congress the provisional committee stopped its activities.

   Following news of the defeat at Sedan, of the revolutionary outbreak in Paris and of the collapse of the Empire on September 4, 1870, workers in many other French cities such as Lyons, Marseilles and Toulouse staged revolutionary armed uprisings and set up Communes as the organs of people's political power. In spite of their short existence, the provincial Communes, particularly the one in Lyons, put into effect a series of important revolutionary measures. For instance, they abolished the police-bureaucrat apparatus, released political prisoners, introduced secular education, levied a tax on the wealthy people and gratuitously redeemed pawned articles from pawnshops. The Government of National Defence ruthlessly suppressed these provincial Communes.

   The revolutionary events of October 31, 1870, indicated the instability of the Government of National Defence. To strengthen its position, the government conducted a plebiscite in Paris on November 3, 1870. Although a large section of Parisians voted against the government, it won a majority through heavy pressure on the people, demagoguery and the state of the siege.

   On April 27, 1825, the reactionary government of Charles X promulgated a law compensating former &eacute;migr&eacute;s for the loss of their estates confiscated in the years of the bourgeois French Revolution. The greater part of the indemnity -- totalling 1,000 million francs and paid by the government in the form of three-per-cent securities -- was obtained by the chief aristocrats at court and the big landlords of France.

   The Provisional Government of France decided on March 16, 1848 to add a 45 centimes tax to each franc of direct tax collected. The burden of this additional tax fell mainly on the peasants. As a result of this policy adopted by the bourgeois Republicans, the peasants were estranged from the revolution and voted for Louis Bonaparte in the presidential election of December 10, 1848.

In opposition to Louis XVI's order that the three estates were to sit separately, the representatives of the third estate assembled at Jeu de Paume (Tennis Court) in Versailles on June 20 and took an oath not to disperse until a constitution for France was worked out. The Tennis Court oath was one of the events that heralded the bourgeois French Revolution.

The treaty confirmed the cession of Alsace and the eastern part of Lorraine to Germany, as was provided for in the preliminary peace treaty of February 26, 1871. The Frankfort treaty imposed even more severe war indemnity terms on France than the preliminary peace treaty and lengthened the time of occupation of French territory by the German troops -- a price the Versailles government had to pay for Bismarck's collaboration in suppressing the Commune. The plunder of France as
