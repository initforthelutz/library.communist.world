<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  On the outbreak of the February Revolution, the German "Communist Party," as we called it, consisted only of a small core, the Communist League, which was organized as a secret propaganda society. The League was secret only because at that time no freedom of association or assembly existed in Germany. Besides the workers' associations abroad, from which it obtained recruits, it had about thirty communities, or sections, in the country itself and, in addition, isolated members in many places. This inconsiderable fighting force, however, possessed a leader, <I>Marx</I>, to whom all willingly subordinated themselves, a leader of the first rank, and, thanks to him, a programme of principles and tactics that today still has full validity: <I><A HREF="CM47.html">The Communist Manifesto</A></I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It is the tactical part of the programme that concerns us here in the first instance. This part stated in general: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 193</B></FONT><P>

  "They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The Communists are distinguished from the other work ing-class parties by this only:&nbsp;1.&nbsp;In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front <I>the common interests</I> of the entire proletariat, <I>independently of all nationality</I>.&nbsp;2.&nbsp;In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent <I>the interests of the movement as a whole</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, <I>practically</I>, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, <I>theoretically</I>, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement."* 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And for the German party it stated in particular: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "In Germany they** fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
    "But they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may straightway use, as so

many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution," etc. (<I>Manifesto</I>, Section <A HREF="CM47.html#s4">IV)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#fnp194">*</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Never has a tactical programme justified itself as well as this one. Put forward on the eve of a revolution, it stood the test of this revolution; whenever, since this period, a workers' party has deviated from it, the deviation has met its punishment; and today, after almost forty years, it serves as the guiding line of all resolute and class-conscious workers' parties in Europe, from Madrid to St. Petersburg. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The February events in Paris precipitated the imminent German Revolution and thereby modified its character. The German bourgeoisie, instead of conquering by virtue of its own power, conquered in the tow of a French workers' revolution. Before it had yet conclusively overthrown its old adversaries -- the absolute monarchy, feudal landownership, the bureaucracy and the cowardly petty bourgeoisie -- it had to confront a new enemy, the proletariat. However, the effects of the economic conditions, which lagged far behind those of France and England, and of the likewise backward class position of Germany resulting therefrom, immediately showed themselves here. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The German bourgeoisie, which had only just begun to establish its large-scale industry, had neither the strength nor the courage to win for itself absolute domination in the state,

nor was there any compelling necessity for it to do so. The proletariat, undeveloped to an equal degree, grown up in complete intellectual enslavement, unorganized and still not even capable of independent organization, possessed only a vague feeling of the deep antagonism between its interests and those of the bourgeoisie. Hence, although in point of fact the threatening antagonist of the latter, it remained, on the other hand, its political appendage. Terrified not by what the German proletariat was, but by what it threatened to become and what the French proletariat already was, the bourgeoisie saw its sole salvation in any compromise, even the most cowardly, with monarchy and aristocracy; as the proletariat was still unacquainted with its own historical role, the bulk of it had, at the start, to take on the role of the forward pressing, extreme Left wing of the bourgeoisie. The German workers had above all to win those rights which were indispensable to their independent organization as a class party: freedom of the press, association and assembly -- rights which the bourgeoisie, in the interest of its own rule, ought to have fought for, but which it itself now disputed in its fear of the workers The few hundred separate League members vanished in the enormous mass that had been suddenly hurled into the movement. Thus, the German proletariat at first appeared on the political stage as the extreme democratic party. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus, when we founded a large newspaper in Germany, our banner was determined as a matter of course. It could only be that of democracy, but that of a democracy which everywhere emphasized in every point the specific proletarian character which it could not yet inscribe once for all on its banner If we did not want to do that, if we did not want to take up the movement, adhere to its already existing, most 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 196</B></FONT><P>

advanced, actually proletarian side and to push it furthcr then there was nothing left for us to do but to preach communism in a little provincial sheet and to found a tiny sect instead of a great party of action. But we had already been spoilt for the role of preachers in the wilderness; we had studied the Utopians too well for that, nor was it for that we had drafted our programme. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When we came to Cologne, preparations, partly by the democrats and partly by the Communists, had been made there for a big newspaper; it was desired to make this a purely local Cologne paper and to banish us to Berlin. But in twenty-four hours, especially thanks to Marx, we were in possession of the field, and the newspaper became ours, on the return concession of taking <I>Heinrich B&uumlrgers</I> into the editorial board. The latter wrote <I>one</I> article (in No. 2) and never another. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   It was precisely Cologne and not Berlin we had to go to. First, Cologne was the centre of the Rhine Province, which had gone through the French Revolution,<A NAME="p196"> which had provided itself with modern legal conceptions in the <I>Code Napol&eacuteon</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en75">75</A>]</FONT> which had developed by far the most important large-scale industry and which was in every respect at that time the most advanced part of Germany. Contemporary Berlin we knew only too well from our own observation, with its hardly hatched bourgeoisie, its cringing petty bourgeoisie, audacious in words but craven in deeds, its still wholly undeveloped workers, its mass of bureaucrats, aristocratic and court riff-raff, its entire character of a mere "<I>Residenz</I>."* Decisive, however, was the following: in Berlin the wretched Prussian 

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=12% ALIGN=left NOSHADE>

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 197</B></FONT><P>

<I>Landrecht </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#fnp197">*</A>]</FONT> prevailed and political cases were tried by professional magistrates; on the Rhine the <I>Code Napol&eacuteon</I> was in force, which knows no press trials, because it presupposes censorship, and if one did not commit political misdemeanours but only <I>crimes</I>, one came before a jury;<A NAME="p197"> in Berlin <I>after</I> the revolution young Schloffel was sentenced to a year's imprisonment for a trifle,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en76">76</A>]</FONT> while on the Rhine we had unconditional freedom of the press -- and we used it to the last drop. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus we began, on June 1, 1848, with a very limited share capital, of which only a little had been paid up and the shareholders themselves were more than unreliable. Half of them deserted us immediately after the first number and at the end of the month we no longer had any at all. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The editorial constitution was simply the dictatorship of Marx. A big daily paper, which has to be ready at a definite hour can not observe a consistent policy with any other constitution. Moreover, Marx's dictatorship was a matter of course here, was undisputed and willingly recognized by all of us. It was primarily his clear vision and firm attitude that made this publication the most famous German newspaper of the years of revolution. 
<A NAME="p197a">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The political programme of the <I>Neue Rheinische Zeitung </I><FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en38">38</A>]</FONT> consisted of two main points: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   A democratic German republic, one and indivisible, and a war with Russia, which included the restoration of Poland. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The petty-bourgeois democracy was divided at that time into two factions: the North German, which would not mind putting up with a democratic Prussian emperor, and the South German, then almost wholly specifically Baden, which wanted to transform Germany into a federative republic after the

Swiss model. We had to fight both of them. The interests of the proletariat forbade equally the Prussianization of Germany and the perpetuation of her division into petty states. These interests made imperative the definitive unification of Germany into a <I>nation</I>, which alone could provide the battlefield, cleared of all traditional petty obstacles, on which proletariat and bourgeoisie were to measure their strength. But they equally forbade the re-establishment of Prussia as the head. The Prussian state with its whole system, its tradition and its dynasty was precisely the sole serious internal adversary which the revolution in Germany had to overthrow; and, moreover, Prussia could unify Germany only by tearing it apart, by the exclusion of German Austria. Dissolution of the Prussian and disintegration of the Austrian state, real unification of Germany as a republic -- we could not have any other revolutionary immediate programme. And this could be realized through war with Russia and only through such a war. I will come back to this last point later. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   For the rest, the tone of the newspaper was by no means solemn, serious or enthusiastic. We had altogether contemptible opponents and treated the lot of them with the utmost scorn.<A NAME="p198"> The conspiring monarchy, the <I>camarilla</I>, the nobility, the <I>Kreuz-Zeitung</I>,<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en77">77</A>]</FONT> the entire "reaction," about which the Philistines were morally indignant -- we treated them only with mockery and derision. Not less so also the new idols that had appeared on the scene through the revolution: the March ministers, the Frankfort and Berlin assemblies, and both the Rights and the Lefts in them. The very first number began with an article which mocked at the inanity of the Frankfort parliament, the purposelessness of its long-winded speeches,<A NAME="p198a"> the superfluity of its cowardly resolutions.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en78">78</A>]</FONT> It cost us half the shareholders. The Frankfort parliament was not 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 199</B></FONT><P>

even a debating club; hardly any debates took place there, but for the most part only academic dissertations prepared beforehand were ground out and resolutions adopted which were intended to inspire the German Philistines but of which no one else took any notice. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   The Berlin Assembly was of more importance: it confronted a real power, it debated and passed resolutions with its feet on the ground, and not in a Frankfort cuckoo land somewhere beyond the clouds. Consequently, it was dealt with in more detail. But there also, the idols of the Lefts, Schulze-Delitzsch, Berends, Elsner, Stein, etc., were just as sharply attacked as those of Frankfort, their irresolution, hesitancy and penny wisdom were mercilessly exposed, and it was proved how step by step they compromised themselves into betraying the revolution. This, of course, evoked a shudder in the democratic petty bourgeois, who had only just manufactured these idols for his own use. To us this shudder was a sign that we had hit the bull's-eye. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We came out likewise against the illusion, zealously spread by the petty bourgeoisie, that the revolution had come to an end with the March days and that one had only now to pocket the fruits. To us, February and March could have had the significance of a real revolution only if they had not been the conclusion but, on the contrary, the starting-point of a long revolutionary movement in which, as in the Great French Revolution, the people would have developed further through its own struggles and the parties become more and more sharply differentiated until they had coincided entirely with the great classes, bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie and proletariat, and in which the separate positions would have been won one after another by the proletariat in a series of battles. Hence, we everywhere opposed also the democratic petty 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 200</B></FONT><P>

bourgeoisie when it tried to gloss over its class antagonism to the proletariat with the favourite phrase: after all, we all want the same thing; all the differences rest on mere misunderstandings. But the less we allowed the petty bourgeoisie to misunderstand our proletarian democracy, the tamer and more amenable it became towards us. The more sharply and resolutely one opposes it, the more readily it ducks and the more concessions it makes to the workers' party. Of that we have become convinced. 
<A NAME="p200">
<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Finally, we exposed the parliamentary cretinism (as Marx called it)<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en79">79</A>]</FONT> of the various so-called national assemblies. These gentlemen had allowed all means of power to slip out of their hands, and in part had voluntarily surrendered them again to the governments. In Berlin, as in Frankfort, alongside newly strengthened, reactionary governments there stood powerless assemblies, which nevertheless imagined that their impotent resolutions would shake the world in its foundations. This cretinous self-deception prevailed even among the extreme Lefts. We told them plainly that their parliamentary victory would coincide with their real defeat. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And it so happened both in Berlin and in Frankfort. When the "Lefts" obtained the majority, the government dispersed the entire Assembly; it could do so because the Assembly had forfeited all credit with the people. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When later I read Bougeart's book on <I>Marat</I>, I found that in more than one respect we had only unconsciously<A NAME="p200a"> imitated the great model of the genuine "<I>Ami du Peuple </I>"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en80">80</A>]</FONT> (not the one forged by the royalists) and that the whole outburst of rage and the whole falsification of history, by virtue of which throughout almost a century only an entirely distorted Marat had been known, were solely due to the fact that Marat mercilessly removed the veil from the idols of the moment, 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 201</B></FONT><P>

Lafayette, Bailly and others, and exposed them as already complete traitors to the revolution; and that he, like us, did not want the revolution declared finished but continuing in permanence. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   We openly proclaimed that the people of the tendency we represented could enter the struggle for the attainment of our real party aims only when the most extreme of the official parties existing in Germany came to the helm; then we would form the opposition to it. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Events, however, brought it about that besides mockery at our German opponents there also appeared fiery passion. The insurrection of the Paris workers in June 1848 found us at our post. From the first shot we were unconditionally on the side of the insurgents.<A NAME="p201"> After their defeat, Marx honoured the vanquished in one of his most powerful articles.<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en81">81</A>]</FONT> 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Then the last remaining shareholders deserted us. But we had the satisfaction of being the only paper in Germany, and almost in Europe, that held aloft the banner of the crushed proletariat at the moment when the bourgeois and petty bourgeois of all countries were overwhelming the vanquished with a torrent of slander. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Our foreign policy was simple: to come out on behalf of every revolutionary people, and to call for a general war of revolutionary Europe against the mighty support of European reaction<A NAME="p201a"> -- Russia. From February 24<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en82">82</A>]</FONT> onwards it was clear to us that the revolution had only <I>one</I> really formidable enemy, Russia, and that the more the movement took on European dimensions the more was this enemy compelled to enter the struggle. The events of Vienna, Milan and Berlin were bound to delay the Russian attack, but its final coming was the more certain the closer the revolution came to Russia. But if one succeeded in getting Germany to make war on Russia, 

<P><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 202</B></FONT><P>

it was all up with the Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns and the revolution would triumph along the whole line. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   This policy pervaded every issue of the newspaper until the moment of the actual invasion of Hungary by the Russians, which fully confirmed our forecast and decided the defeat of the revolution. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   When, in the spring of 1849, the decisive battle drew near, the language of the paper became more violent and passionate with every issue.<A NAME="p202"> William Wolff reminded the Silesian peasants in the "Silesian Milliard" (eight articles),<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en83">83</A>]</FONT> how on being emancipated from feudal services they had been cheated out of money and land by the landlords with the help of the government, and he demanded a thousand million thalers in compensation. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At the same time, in April, <I>Marx</I>'s essay "<A HREF="WLC47.html">Wage-Labour and Capital</A>" appeared in the form of a series of editorial articles as a clear indication of the social goal of our policy. Every issue, every special number, pointed to the great battle that was in preparation, to the sharpening of the antagonisms in France, Italy, Germany and Hungary. In particular, the special numbers in April and May were so many proclamations to the people to hold themselves in readiness for direct action. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "Outside, throughout the Reich," wonder was expressed that we carried on our activities so unconcernedly within a Prussian fortress of the first rank, in the face of a garrison of eight thousand troops and in the face of the guardhouse; but, on account of the eight rifles with bayonets and 250 live cartridges in the editorial room, and the red Jacobin caps of the compositors, our house was reckoned by the officers also as a fortress which was not to be taken by a mere <I>coup de main</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   At last, on May 18, 1849, the blow came. 

<P ALIGN=right><FONT SIZE=-2><B>page 203</B></FONT><P>

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
  The insurrection was suppressed in Dresden and Elberfeld, in Iserlohn it was encircled; the Rhine Province and Westphalia bristled with bayonets which, after completing the rape of the Prussian Rhineland, were intended to be marched against the Palatinate and Baden. Then at last the government ventured to come to close quarters with us. One half of the editorial staff was prosecuted, the other half was liable to deportation as non-Prussians. Nothing could be done against it, as long as a whole army corps stood behind the government. We had to surrender our fortress, but we withdrew with our arms and baggage, with band playing and flag flying, the flag of the last issue, a red issue, in which we warned the Cologne workers against hopeless <I>putsches</I>, and called to them: 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   "In taking leave, the editors of the <I>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</I> thank you for the sympathy you have shown them. Their last word will always and everywhere be: <I>The Emancipation of the Working Class! </I>" 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   Thus the <I>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</I> came to an end, shortly before it had completed its first year. Begun almost without financial resources -- the little that had been promised it very soon, as we said, was lost to it -- it had achieved a circulation of almost 5,000 by September. The state of siege in Cologne suspended it; in the middle of October it had to begin again from the beginning. But in May 1849, when it was suppressed,<A NAME="p203"> it already had 6,000 subscribers again, while the "Kolnische </I>"<FONT SIZE=-2>[<A HREF="MNRZ84.html#en84">84</A>]</FONT> at that time, according to its own admission, had not more than 9,000. No German newspaper, before or since, has ever had the same power and influence or been able to electrify the proletarian masses as effectively as the <I>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</I>. 

<P>&nbsp &nbsp
   And that it owed above all to Marx.

   On <I>June 13</I>, <I>1849</I>, the petty-bourgeois party of Montagnards organized a peaceful demonstration in Paris to protest against the dispatch of French troops to Italy to suppress the revolution there in violation of the Constitution of the French Republic which prohibited the sending of French forces abroad to interfere with the freedom of foreign peoples. The demonstration was dispersed by troops. Its failure testified to the bankruptcy of French petty-bourgeois democracy. From that day the French authorities launched persecutions against democrats, including foreigners residing in France.
